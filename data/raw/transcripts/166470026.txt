[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.100]   So again, we're taking a week off from Romans and to take some time to talk about the subject
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.840]   of mothers.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.760]   We have to really ask this question, is this biblical for Christians to be celebrating
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.760]   Mother's Day at church?
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.400]   And obviously, it's not not biblical outside.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.720]   It would be unheard of if you didn't practice Mother's Day.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.080]   But at church, is it right for us to say, you know what, all the other days we're going
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.560]   to be celebrating Jesus, but on Mother's Day, we're going to celebrate mothers.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.640]   If we're not careful, it can easily turn into, we're going to worship mother today.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.040]   You know, we're going to take a break from Jesus because every other day is Jesus.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.200]   Today is going to be Mother's Day.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.920]   So we have to ask the question, is that something that a church should be doing?
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.040]   To take a day off and say, you know what, we're going to really honor the mothers.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.880]   By the title and the text that we just read, you already know my answer.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.680]   It is absolutely necessary.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.160]   And we want to look at the text and really see why is this particular command singled
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.320]   out?
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.520]   Not because I'm singling out, not because the United States has singled this out.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.440]   We don't celebrate this because, you know, some somebody in U.S. history decided that
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.880]   we should we should honor mothers.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880]   So we're going to join with them in honor of the mothers.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.880]   We don't celebrate this.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.040]   They just we are taking advantage of the fact that the country is celebrating this.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.440]   And it is important, obviously.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.000]   But the scripture itself singles this particular commandment out.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.720]   He says, honor your father and mother that your days may be long in the land that the
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.800]   Lord your God is giving you.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.120]   And this commandment is repeated again in Ephesians chapter six.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.320]   And he says this commandment comes with the promise that if you want to live long to be
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.700]   blessed, to honor your father and mother.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.680]   So why is this particular commandment singled out?
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.760]   The word for honor that is used here in Hebrew is the word "Kabbad."
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.380]   And the word "Kabbad" is related to the word "glory."
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.040]   And the word literally means to think heavily, to honor, to give weight.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.480]   That same word is used to describe honoring the temple, the sanctuary, or honoring the
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   Sabbath.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.500]   And what they mean by that is to take something that is sacred and consider it deeply.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.740]   That you would think twice about how you approach it, that what you think about it, the activities
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.560]   that you do when you're around these things.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.680]   And so that's the same word "Kabbad" that is used when we are commanded to honor your
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.680]   father and mother.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.220]   To think deeply.
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.640]   To put weight upon it.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.160]   In fact if you study the Ten Commandments itself, you know that in the Ten Commandments
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.400]   you have two sections.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.520]   You have the first section where the first four commandments are related to worshiping
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.560]   God, in our relationship with God.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.560]   It says to not have any other, to worship not any other gods besides Him, besides Yahweh.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.360]   To not have any graven images of Him.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.360]   Not to use His name in vain.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.560]   And to keep the Sabbath holy.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.040]   All of it in our relationship with God.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.480]   The second part of it is our relationship with one another.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.480]   And some of you guys may remember, but it's honor the father and mother is the first one,
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.000]   that's the fifth commandment.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.480]   And then it says do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear faultlessness,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.280]   do not covet.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.200]   You know that in the Bible, that they don't put lists together randomly.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.720]   Like today if I was to ask you, what's your ten favorite food?
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.160]   You know you might start with Korean barbecue or you know whatever, like you might Indian
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.680]   food and you might make a list of ten things.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.000]   But it doesn't necessarily mean that it's in that order.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.720]   Unless you specifically ask, you know, put it from your best to the worst.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.240]   Ten top things, right?
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.440]   In the scripture, whenever you see a list of things, it's almost always done purposefully.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.280]   So whenever you see the list of the disciples, whose name is always on the top?
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.320]   Peter.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.560]   Peter's name is always on the top.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.640]   And along with Peter, you have James and John.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.720]   It's almost always, every list of the disciples is always listed that way.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.560]   And there's a reason, because in the Bible, whether in the Old and the New Testament,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.120]   lists were given with a particular purpose.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.920]   It was to convey a message.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.320]   So in the New Testament or in the scripture, when they say, oh these are the ten foods
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.720]   that I like the most, you know that whatever they listed the first is probably the best.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.480]   Whatever they listed the last is probably the worst, right?
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.680]   So when you apply that to the Ten Commandments, we know that the very first commandment is
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.200]   the most significant, most important commandment, which is not to worship any other gods but
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   Him.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.480]   And all the other commandments in the Ten Commandments are under that umbrella.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.960]   But again, as I said, the first four commandments is related to our relationship with Him.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.040]   And then the second list of commandments is related to our relationship with one another.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.440]   So we understand, in the first commandment, and then the other three that come underneath
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.120]   it, obviously, it's obvious that worshiping God and God alone would be the biggest and
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.880]   the most overarching commandment.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.040]   But when we get to the second list, think about what's on this list.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.040]   Do not kill.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   Do not steal.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040]   Do not commit adultery.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040]   Do not covet.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.960]   Do not bear false witness.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.860]   When was the last time you thought honoring your mother and father was of more significance
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.080]   than not killing?
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.080]   Committing adultery.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.120]   I mean, we would automatically think that murder would be on the top thing.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.040]   You would think that out of this list, maybe you would say, do not murder, do not commit
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.520]   adultery, maybe even do not steal.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.040]   And then you have maybe the coveting and bear false witness, maybe you kind of put the honoring
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.680]   your father and mother maybe on the number three or four of this list of six.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.160]   But not only is it the first one when it comes to our relationship with people, it actually
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.840]   comes with a promise that if you obey this, that God was going to bless you and you'll
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.440]   live long in the land.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.600]   Some of you guys may be sitting here thinking, like, that's great.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   It is so important.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.720]   You know, maybe some of you guys who have children say, my kids need to be in here.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.640]   Why didn't they not bring the Sunday school kids in here?
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   Right?
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.640]   Maybe some of you guys are thinking that.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.000]   Or maybe our kids are too young.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   If they're old enough, can you please do this message again when they're old enough to understand
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.800]   because they need to hear this.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   Right?
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.480]   Or maybe some of you guys are sitting here thinking, like, you know, this is a great
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.480]   message.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.480]   You know, it's for the Sunday school kids.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.280]   You know, they need to hear it.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.280]   But I'm not of that age.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.240]   I don't live under my parents' roof anymore.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.240]   So this is not as significant.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.240]   You know, I'm in my 30s.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.240]   I'm a grown man.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.160]   I'm in my 40s or 50s.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.040]   This isn't relevant to me.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.040]   Right?
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.440]   But in actuality, if you, one of the questions that I asked on Facebook as you're preparing
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.360]   is who was this commandment given to?
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.720]   Was it, you have 10 commandments and it said, you know, here's one, two, three, four, and
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.720]   then when you get to the fifth, you gather all the children.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   We're going to go outside.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.100]   We're going to have a Sunday school lesson.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.320]   And then honor your father and mother.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.320]   Right?
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   If you want to live long.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.320]   Right?
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.360]   In other words, if you don't want to die, you better honor your father and mother.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.000]   And then they came back into the regular congregation and then, and then talked about the rest of
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   the stuff.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Is that what they did?
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.800]   Who was this given to?
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.920]   To the children or to the adults?
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.040]   To the adults.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.080]   This was given to the nation of Israel.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.760]   It wasn't just a Sunday school lesson.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:53.540]   In fact, when this particular commandment is repeated in Ephesians chapter 6, 1 through
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.300]   3, it says, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.580]   Honor your father and mother.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.980]   This is the first commandment with a promise that it may go well with you and that you
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.180]   may live long in the land."
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.520]   So basically that same fifth commandment is repeated in the New Testament.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:14.280]   But the word for children here, the word in the Greek is "teknon."
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.700]   The word in the Greek that describes a small child in age or stature is "paes."
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:26.020]   "Paes," when you see the word "paes," it's referring to literal kids, you know, of age.
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.960]   But the word that is used here, "teknon," is in reference to everybody.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.140]   So that word could be used as in, "We're the children of God," right?
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.460]   When Paul says that the Corinthians were their spiritual children.
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:44.580]   So that word, in general reference, refers to adults and children.
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.580]   So that commandment, again, not only in the Old Testament, but even in the New Testament,
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.180]   is in reference to grown people.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.720]   Not just small children.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.100]   This is not just, you know, "I have a job now.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.820]   I pay my own bills.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.220]   You know, in fact, I give my mom money, so now I'm an adult.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.540]   So now I'm in the position of honor, you know, rather than giving honor."
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.660]   Well, again, clearly that's not what this is talking about.
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.540]   This is in reference to all of us.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:18.220]   There's not a single one of us where this text isn't a command that we ought to obey.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.020]   So the question is, why is this commandment singled out?
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:28.740]   Why is it so significant that of all the things that are mentioned in the Greatest of the
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.140]   Commandments, he says, "It's the top."
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:39.580]   See, the Scripture clearly says, again, this is the main point of what we're doing this
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:46.780]   morning, that honoring your father and mother is the most tangible application of loving
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.820]   and honoring God.
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.340]   Let me say that again.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.940]   Honoring your father and mother is the most tangible application of loving and honoring
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.940]   God.
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:02.980]   Remember, when the Jews would continue to come to Jesus and try to stumble Him and ask
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.420]   Him, "What is the greatest commandment?"
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.060]   And the reason why they asked Jesus this question was, there was a constant debate in the Jewish
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.060]   community.
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.500]   They had over 600 different laws that they were supposed to obey, right?
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.180]   They had some things written in the Bible.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.580]   In fact, they had more things that they created above and beyond what the Scripture says.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.940]   And so they were having a hard time obeying all of it.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:32.120]   So basically what they were asking was, "Which commandments are worth five points, and which
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.540]   are worth one point?"
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.020]   Like, let's say if you're playing video game and you go straight after the ones that give
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.020]   you the best points, right?
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.420]   You don't want to waste all your time trying to knock off the lower point.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.900]   You want to go and get the most points possible.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.780]   So they were asking, "Of all the commandments, and I can't do all of them, which are the
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:54.180]   ones that I really should obey first, and then not to worry so much about the lesser
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.180]   commandments?"
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.300]   That's really what they were asking, because this was a constant source of debate.
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.740]   We want to appease God, we want to be righteous by our works, but which gives us the most
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.580]   points?
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.620]   In response to that, Jesus responds to them, Matthew 22, 37, "And he said to him, 'You
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:14.300]   shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind.'"
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.940]   This is the great and first commandment.
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.140]   And second is like it.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.540]   "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.700]   And on these two commandments depends all the law and the prophets.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.500]   I want to point out two things here, right?
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.500]   The first one is kind of a side point.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.900]   The second point is the main point.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:36.380]   The first one is, they're asking the question, "Which commandment gives me the best points?
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.540]   Will get me closer to God?"
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.740]   Jesus' response was, "To love him with all your heart, love your neighbor as yourself,
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.580]   and all the other commandments are under that umbrella."
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.060]   Do you see what Jesus said?
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.660]   Jesus didn't answer his question at all.
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:57.300]   Like in a typical manner, he exposes the intent of their heart, just like he does with all
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.260]   the other questions they bring him.
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.980]   They want to know, "Which one should I do?"
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.140]   When he says, basically, what do they say?
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.140]   "All of them."
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.140]   Right?
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.380]   "All of them."
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.860]   It's not necessarily what you do, but why you do it.
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:14.420]   To love the Lord your God, every commandment that you're concerned to keep, it's not which
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.820]   one is the greatest, but why.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.900]   Why do you do it?
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.580]   In all of the law, the base of why God commanded these things was love.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.420]   Now, that's kind of a side point.
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.220]   The point that I want to get to this morning is the second one, where he says in verse
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:34.460]   39, and he says, "The first commandment, love God, the second commandment is like it."
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.460]   Right?
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.460]   "Homoy."
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.460]   It is like it.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.660]   It is of similar substance.
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.820]   In other words, what Jesus is saying is, you cannot separate these two commandments.
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.420]   To love God and love your neighbor are similar.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:55.300]   So you cannot love God and hate your brother and say that you love God.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.780]   In fact, John makes that very clear in 1 John 4, 20.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:04.300]   If anyone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar.
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:09.020]   For he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.780]   not seen.
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.980]   And this commandment we have from him, "Whoever loves God must also love his brother."
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.560]   Now in that text, he is not talking about a relationship with father and mother.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.460]   But the application is same.
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:29.260]   That if you say that you love God, and yet you don't love the people who are around you,
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.500]   he says your love is not true.
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.620]   Right?
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.060]   Loving God isn't how high you raise your hand during service.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.420]   Right?
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:42.300]   Loving God isn't how well you're dressed, or how much money you gave, or how frequently
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.220]   you come to church.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.460]   He says, "If you love me, obey my commandments."
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.820]   And what is the greatest of the commandments?
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.420]   It's love your neighbor.
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.420]   Right?
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:58.300]   So the most tangible way to express and honor our Heavenly Father is to honor our earthly
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.920]   father and our earthly mother.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.260]   So that's why he says these two commandments, loving God and loving your neighbor, are like
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.260]   each other.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.260]   They are similar.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.380]   You can't do one without the other.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:23.540]   In Matthew chapter 25, 42-46, it says, "For I was hungry, and you gave me no food.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.100]   I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink.
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.420]   I was a stranger, and you did not welcome me.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.300]   Naked, and you did not clothe me.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.060]   Sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me."
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:38.220]   Then they also will answer, saying, "Lord, when do we see you hungry, or thirsty, or
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.840]   stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you?"
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.160]   Then he will answer them, saying, "Truly I say to you, as you did not do it to the one
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.960]   of the least of these, you did not do it to me."
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.960]   In other words, all those who are least and insignificant that you've ignored, in essence,
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.980]   they were in the presence of Christ in their life.
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.980]   And what you did to them, he said, "You did to me."
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.500]   What you didn't do to them, you didn't do to me.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.980]   The scripture describes our relationship with God in various ways.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.980]   The way he describes the church and Jesus is bride and groom.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:18.940]   Now, again, that's an image I really have to work hard to relate to, because, one, I'm
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.740]   not a female, and we're the bride in this illustration, so we kind of have to picture
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.900]   ourselves like we're the female.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.260]   And so what he's describing is a very intimate relationship.
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:34.180]   It would be easier if I was a female, I'd say, "Oh, I'm the bride."
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:41.260]   But that's, again, to describe a love, deep love relationship between Christ and His church.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.440]   Sheep and shepherd is another description of the church in him.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.440]   That's a lot easier.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.260]   Like, dumb sheep, that's definitely me.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.140]   If I'm not led properly, I get distracted.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.340]   I have adult ADHD, so I get distracted really easily.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.600]   So it's like sheep.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.820]   So when he said, "You're like sheep and he's a shepherd," that's for sure.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:01.820]   I can relate to that.
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.420]   I don't have to work hard to put myself in those shoes.
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.500]   It also describes us as friends.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.340]   And again, it's a description that I can understand, but it's a little bit harder.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.900]   Like, how are you friends with God?
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.820]   Are you a Savior?
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.700]   But all of these things describe a different aspect of our relationship with God that God
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.180]   is trying to convey.
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:27.120]   He's using human relationships to describe how He feels toward us and what kind of relationship
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.540]   we should have toward Him.
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.620]   But all the relationships, all the illustrations that we see in the scripture, the thing that
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:40.060]   I have the easiest time understanding is a relationship between parent and child.
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.860]   There's a love relationship with Him where God is our Father, and at times He describes
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.460]   Himself as the Mother.
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:51.540]   A lot of times when He's talking about the imagery of the Father, it emphasizes His strength,
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:56.380]   His sovereignty, His protection, His discipleship.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:03.460]   But often when God wants to convey His tender love, He describes a love of a mother.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:08.580]   When He's pleading with the nation of Israel, now this is not only true in the book of Isaiah,
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:12.220]   it's all over scripture, but in particular, those of you who have been following with
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.940]   us in the book of Isaiah, how often He uses that imagery as a mother to plead with the
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.100]   nation of Israel to return.
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.020]   In Isaiah 46.3, it says, "Listen to me, O house of Jacob.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:29.380]   Call the remnant of the house of Israel who have been born by me from before your birth,
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.580]   carried from the womb."
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:38.540]   He's describing a particular relationship that Israel has with Him, and He's describing
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.300]   it as a mother with a child in the womb.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.820]   Because there's a special kind of connection.
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:47.420]   He's saying, "Israel, you're not like any other nation."
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.040]   There's this love relationship, there's this specific connection He has with the nation
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.040]   of Israel.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.260]   He's saying to return.
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:59.740]   Return to me because I love you as a mother who carries a child.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.820]   I remember when my oldest son, Jeremy, or first son, when he was born, something that
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.540]   the hospital said to me that stuck with me even to this day.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.340]   As we were leaving, and anybody who's had their first child handed to them and you're
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.180]   leaving the hospital, it's kind of scary.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.180]   You know what I mean?
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.740]   We used to own a dog when we were little, and we had three boys in our homes, and my
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.140]   parents used to have a little chihuahua.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.140]   We tortured that animal.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.300]   You know, because we're three boys.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.340]   We used to play catch with this thing.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:32.820]   We did a lot of dumb things.
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.520]   And then, that was the last time I remember really caring for something that delicate.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.740]   And then the next thing was my baby.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:48.180]   So when they handed my first son to me, and as a leader of the home, I'm like, "Are you
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.460]   serious?
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.100]   This is how it works?
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.260]   You have a child, and this child, if you don't feed it, it'll die?
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.900]   If you don't change his diaper to get rashes, then it'll die?
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.020]   If you don't wake up and take care of it, it'll die?"
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:06.460]   I'm thinking like, the last time I remember taking care of a dog, I didn't do a good job.
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.700]   Now you're going to hand a human being?
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.340]   You would think there'd be some sort of a level.
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:14.500]   You go from nothing to human being.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.260]   And I remember leaving the hospital with this baby just freaking out.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.740]   You could tell a veteran parent versus the new parents.
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:24.260]   The new parents are usually cuddling their baby.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.260]   They're so afraid.
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.260]   It's like fine China.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:31.900]   And then the parents who have three or four kids, they carry the baby like a football.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.580]   You've gotten accustomed to holding this baby.
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.980]   Well, I was that dad.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.820]   When we first gave the baby, I was so afraid.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.900]   And I remember Esther, every time the baby would cry, every time anything would happen,
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.820]   run to the hospital.
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.940]   I remember something they said that stuck with me.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.940]   They said, and they said it to Esther, not to me.
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:56.380]   They said, "There is a kind of bond that happens between a mother and a child because literally
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.180]   the baby is a piece of the mom.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.820]   And there is a connection that we can't explain scientifically.
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:07.100]   That the mother's instinct toward the baby, because the baby was with the mom for nine
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.940]   months, that when they come out, there is a connection.
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.780]   So sometimes the mom would have an intuition that the baby is sick or something's wrong,
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.900]   and the doctors can't tell exactly what it is.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:23.260]   And I remember them saying to her, not to me, but her, "If you think something is wrong,
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:28.260]   but you can't identify specifically what it is, bring the baby in."
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.660]   And I remember listening to that, I was like, "That doesn't sound like medicine.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.940]   That don't sound scientific."
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.640]   But it really stuck with me because even the doctors recognized that there was some kind
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.380]   of a connection between the mom and the child that they can't really explain.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.980]   There's a kind of an instinct between them.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.980]   And it makes sense.
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:51.420]   Because that child literally is a piece of the mom.
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:58.780]   So when God decides to convey this message of love, what imagery does He use?
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.980]   The imagery that He uses is between a mom and a child.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.900]   He says, "You've strayed away from me."
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:10.340]   But He says, "You're like, I knew you even in your mother's womb."
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:14.280]   In Isaiah 49, 15, can a woman forget her nursing child?
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.460]   That she would have no compassion in the son of her womb?
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.460]   It's a rhetorical question.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.000]   You know, He concludes it by saying, "Even these may forget.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.360]   Even if that does happen, yet I will not forget you."
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.660]   But the first part of it is a rhetorical question.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:34.820]   He's saying, "Have you ever seen a mom who's nursing a child who forgets the child?"
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:40.180]   In other words, He's using that imagery, that deep, intimate love of a nursing mother to
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.640]   convey to the nation of Israel.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.220]   That that's how much He loves them.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.380]   And that's, He uses that imagery to convey to them, "Why would you run to idols who are
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.380]   nothing?
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.560]   They're just piece of wood.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.100]   Why would you run to Egypt?
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.260]   They don't care about you like the way I care about you."
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:02.980]   So if you always, if you see God pleading with His people, He always conveys two things.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.260]   One, He is the only creator.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.260]   And two, He loves and cares for them.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:16.380]   And again, the most deepest, most intimate relationship that He uses to convey this love
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.740]   is the love of the mother.
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:25.340]   In Hosea chapter 11, verse 1 through 4, again, God is pleasing, pleading to Israel through
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.500]   the prophet Hosea.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.420]   And He, this is what He says, "Then Israel was a child.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.960]   I loved him.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.340]   And out of Egypt I called my son.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.900]   The more they were called, the more they went away.
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.620]   They kept sacrificing to Baal and burning offerings to idols.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.380]   Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk.
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.060]   I took them up by their arms."
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:54.340]   He uses the imagery of a parent or a mother who is raising up a child and teaching them
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.980]   how to walk and to hold them.
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:04.540]   God has placed, if there's, you know, we all experience common grace, Christian or not.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:09.900]   God has placed mothers in particular, fathers as well, but today is not Father's Day, like
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:18.260]   mothers in particular, because the greatest example of unconditional love typically is
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.380]   through our mothers.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.860]   Typically.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:26.740]   So what Scripture says is, if you don't know how to honor and thank the people who have
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:32.020]   labored for you the most, how will you glorify and honor and worship a God that you do not
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.820]   see?
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:40.500]   If you don't know how to honor your father and mother who is tangibly or tangibly physically
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:47.540]   taught you how to walk, how will you recognize a God that you do not physically see?
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:52.160]   See when he's talking about, "I taught Ephraim how to walk."
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:58.340]   Every single one of us, we learned how to walk because somebody taught us.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:04.220]   And my guess is 99% of you were taught how to walk by your mothers, most likely, right?
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.260]   And your fathers helped.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.460]   You know, we have a tendency to think that the people who labor the most in our lives,
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.180]   we just say, "Of course, you're supposed to, you're supposed to.
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.540]   You're our mom, you're our dad, you're supposed to do that."
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.460]   And that oftentimes reflects the way we treat God.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.940]   Only every once in a while when something spectacular happens, we win the lottery or
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.820]   we wanted some job and God gave us a job or, you know, we want to get into a certain school
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.100]   and God gives us that.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.580]   "Oh, thank God, God is so gracious to us."
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:40.860]   But on a day-to-day basis, we're just like, "Oh, of course, he's God, he's supposed to
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.060]   do that."
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:48.500]   And oftentimes that's the way it's reflected in the way that we treat the people who have
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.540]   done the most for us in our lives.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.260]   We just assume they're supposed to do it.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:57.860]   So when our friends or acquaintances or coworkers remembers your birthday, does something, it's
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.860]   huge.
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.620]   "I can't believe you knew me.
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.620]   Why would you?
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.260]   You're so generous."
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:10.180]   And yet when it comes to our parents who wake up every single day to cook breakfast, lunch,
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:14.860]   and dinner, you're supposed to do that, right?
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.780]   Who taught you how to walk?
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.220]   Who taught you how to eat?
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.300]   I guarantee you, you didn't walk by yourself.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.060]   You didn't wake up one day and look at your peers and say, "It's about time."
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.060]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.060]   I'm behind.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.060]   Everybody else is walking.
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:34.620]   You know, I'm about 11 months old and I'm starting to fall behind.
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.500]   I better start walking.
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.500]   Somebody taught you.
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.540]   Somebody grabbed you by the hand and walked.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.300]   And that didn't happen overnight.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.900]   It takes months.
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.060]   Some of you, much longer.
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.660]   You didn't learn to eat by yourself.
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.300]   You didn't wake up one day and say, "You know what?
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.300]   I'm so hungry.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.540]   I'm tired of this milk.
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.740]   I need to eat some solid food."
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:57.740]   Right?
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.780]   And you didn't grab a spoon and start learning how to eat.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.420]   Somebody taught you how to eat.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.420]   Right?
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.520]   And you think that's nothing.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.520]   You may think that's nothing.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.460]   Those of you who've never raised a child or maybe tried to train a kid to eat, you know
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.340]   how much work goes into just getting them to put that food in their mouth and keep it
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.340]   in their mouth?
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:22.580]   I mean, you've got to be like an actor, a philosopher.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.180]   I mean, you have to trick him.
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.980]   You have to say, "Oh, here comes the whatever."
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.700]   And then you have to trick him and put it in their mouth.
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.180]   And you have to distract them constantly.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:35.420]   And if they're sick and they don't have an appetite and the mom has to go find out, like,
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.140]   what is he allergic to and if he's allergic to this.
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.940]   And then they've got to figure out, like, "Okay, this food has this too much in it.
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:42.940]   This is what's healthy."
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:47.820]   So they go through all of that to figure out just so that you could eat.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.540]   So you don't die.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.780]   That didn't just happen.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.900]   You didn't just learn how to eat.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.540]   Your mom taught you how to eat.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.260]   You think you taught yourself how to put pants on.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.260]   You didn't.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.680]   You're good at it now.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.620]   Somebody taught you how to put that pants on.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.460]   All of us will be walking around with shoelaces untied.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.220]   If somebody didn't teach you how to do that.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.380]   Somebody taught you how to drive.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.940]   You didn't teach that yourself.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.700]   Somebody sat in the car patiently, paid the bills, taught you how to drive.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.900]   Your hair would be a total mess.
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.540]   If somebody didn't teach you how to comb your hair.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.780]   These are basic things that make you human beings.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.340]   Basic things.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.980]   You wouldn't be able to come to church without these basic things.
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.020]   But because it is so basic, we have a tendency to kind of just assume.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.020]   It just happened.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.020]   I did it myself.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.020]   Right?
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.980]   Remember what Romans chapter 1 says?
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:47.540]   They refused to acknowledge the Creator and rather gave credit to the creation.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.740]   You know where that starts?
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:53.420]   You know where you can see that being manifested?
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.020]   In the home.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:01.020]   Where you don't recognize the person who is giving you the most, sacrificing the most.
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.580]   And you just assume it just happened.
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:08.700]   See that type of mentality translates into the way that we worship God.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:15.700]   See the most tangible way that we express our love and worship and thankfulness is the
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:21.300]   person that God has given us to take care of the most basic, fundamental, important
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.660]   things in our lives.
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.820]   That's why he says, "How do you come and worship a God that you do not see when you do not
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:34.100]   know how to give thanks to the people who are immediately sacrificing for you?"
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.480]   Who taught you how to walk?
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.620]   Who taught you how to eat?
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.420]   Who taught you how to do laundry?
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.460]   Who taught you how to drive?
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:48.540]   All of these things is God's common grace that God has given us.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:53.220]   He says, "I led them with cords of kindness and with the bands of love.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.180]   And I became to them as one who eases the yoke on their jaws.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:02.040]   And I bent down to them and fed them."
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.660]   Whenever we talk about love for God or God's love for us, you know, what's the first illustration
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.900]   that we think of?
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.340]   It's typically, I'm not saying it's always, I know a lot of us may come from a home that
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.760]   was broken and maybe you don't have good memories.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:24.580]   But even in the worst situation, he says, "Can a nursing mom forget her child?"
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:28.580]   He says, "The answer is absolutely not.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:33.780]   It's because God revealed his love toward us and gave us an example through our moms
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.580]   that we're able to recognize who he is.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:40.660]   We wouldn't be able to relate to who God is if it wasn't for the tangible love that was
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.040]   expressed through our parents."
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.420]   In Proverbs 30, 11 through 17, it says, "There are those who curse their fathers and do not
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.380]   bless their mothers."
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:55.580]   And then that section ends with verse 17, "The eye that mocks a father and scorns to
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:00.060]   obey a mother will be picked out by the dravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures."
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:04.320]   I mean, it's pretty brutal, right?
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:10.600]   Everything that he says in between is a description of a child who refuses to acknowledge their
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.040]   parents and honor them.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.040]   And this is what it says.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.680]   I'll read starting from verse 11.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.280]   "There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers."
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.280]   Verse 12.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.680]   "There are those who are clean in their own eyes but are not washed of their filth."
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.200]   In other words, they look at themselves and say, "Well, I'm doing all of these other things."
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   Right?
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.560]   "There are those, how lofty are their eyes, how high their eyelids lift.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.600]   There are those whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, that devour the poor from
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.440]   off the earth, the needy from among mankind.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.240]   The leech has two daughters.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.760]   First daughter's name is Giv, and the second daughter's name is Giv, they cry."
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:53.080]   In other words, it's a picture of a selfish child, and all it knows how to do is to ask,
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.680]   "Giv, Giv, Giv, Giv, Giv."
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.300]   And the moment that you stop giving, they start whining.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:04.540]   This is a description of, again, in Proverbs, of a child who refuses to honor father and
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.540]   mother.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:06.940]   "Three things are never satisfied.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.940]   Four never say, 'Enough.'
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:15.320]   Sheol, the barren womb, the land that never satisfied with water, and fire that never
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.320]   says, 'Enough.'
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.320]   It is never enough."
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:22.740]   This is a description of an individual who all it knows, he's the center of the universe,
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.100]   and he says, "Giv, Giv, Giv, Giv, Giv."
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.420]   And no matter what you give, it's not enough.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.220]   So therefore, instead of recognizing what you have, you're always complaining about
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.620]   what you didn't get.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:40.840]   How many of us, when we were kids, you know, after all day of mom sacrificing cooking and
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:46.980]   cleaning, at the end of the day, you know, you wanted some jambaljas, and mom said, "No."
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.180]   You wanted to watch a cartoon, and mom said, "No."
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:51.860]   You wanted to play a video game, and mom said, "No."
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.380]   And then you went to bed thinking like, "I hate my mom.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.700]   I wish I had the other mom, or my auntie, or whoever.
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.540]   They let me do whatever I want."
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.220]   See, that Proverbs is a description of that child.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.220]   Now we may think, "Oh, we've outgrown that."
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.900]   You know, that's not us.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.700]   We're more sophisticated than that.
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:15.900]   See, but God describes, and He examines our lives, and the reason why He says, why this
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.500]   particular commandment comes with a promise that if you honor your father and mother,
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.660]   you will live long and be blessed.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:29.500]   Above killing, above stealing, above lying, above adultery.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.700]   Why?
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:37.860]   Because an individual, a society, who does not recognize and does not know how to thank
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:44.260]   the people or the people most tangibly above them, everything else unravels.
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:50.460]   A child who is selfish, self-centered, and never says enough, is not saying that they're
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:55.780]   going to become a murderer, but a society begins to unravel and begins to take a slow,
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.660]   declining path toward immorality.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.180]   So this is not a promise to an individual today if you go, "If I buy my mom dinner,
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.420]   I'm going to live another year."
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.420]   Right?
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.700]   That's not what He's saying.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:13.860]   He's saying a promise to the society in general, to the nation of Israel, to God's people.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:20.780]   And when we don't know how to recognize and give thanks to God, when the very fabric of
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:25.780]   the thing that God created us for is to worship Him, and we don't know how to worship Him
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:31.340]   because we become so focused on ourselves and my needs and what I want, that we forget
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.060]   what it is that we already have in Him.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:39.500]   He's given us His only begotten Son, and we spend all our days complaining about what
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.220]   we don't have.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.020]   And when we become that child, and how is it evidenced?
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:49.340]   A lot of times in the way that we treat our parents, because they're the most tangible,
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:54.660]   they're the most giving, they're the most deserving of praise and honor in our lives.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:59.180]   And if we don't know how to give them praise, it probably reflects in the way that we think
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.680]   about our God.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:08.740]   And that's why He is saying that if you obey these things, it comes with a promise.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:09.740]   And it starts.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.100]   And this is why this is so important.
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.460]   It's not simply about honoring mothers.
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:22.780]   Honoring mothers, honoring our parents, is the most tangible way to give honor to our
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:23.780]   God.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:30.620]   See, in the last days, in Romans chapter 130, in 2 Timothy 3, 2, it describes a society
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:35.820]   that has drifted away from God, the love of God has grown cold, and there is no desire
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:43.340]   for Him, and one of the descriptions of that is they will be haters of parents, rebellious.
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:51.180]   You ever wonder why God didn't make us grown adults, you know, like, we always have that
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.100]   discussion, is it the chicken or the egg?
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.060]   You know, how old was Adam when God created him?
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.060]   Did He make him 40?
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.380]   I don't think He made him 40.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:03.500]   My guess is, again, this is nothing based on scripture, this is just my guess, that
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:08.260]   he was probably 14, 14 or 15.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:12.140]   And the reason why, again, this is not in the Bible, don't go out and say, "Oh, he
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.140]   said this in the Bible."
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.140]   It's not in the Bible, okay?
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.900]   It's just my guess.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:20.740]   Because that's the age when, you know, they're physically old enough to have kids, you know,
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.060]   and so physically they're old enough, right?
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.540]   And maturity is very different depending on what culture you're in.
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.060]   So I think God made him that.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:31.220]   But why did God make him an adult instead of a child, right?
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:35.180]   Whether, you know, we have this discussion, chicken or the egg or whatever, but every
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:39.940]   single one of us, we were born little children, completely helpless.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.380]   Even Jesus, He wanted to sympathize with our weaknesses.
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.140]   He didn't come as a crone man.
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.900]   Couldn't He have come as a 30-year-old and live three years?
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:52.860]   Why did He have to live 33 years to live perfectly and say, "Okay, now He's a perfect sacrifice
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:53.860]   for us"?
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.100]   But He came as a child.
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.100]   Why did He do that, right?
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:02.260]   And why did He make us children and have to grow up, you know?
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:10.020]   And I mean, this is a human life that God's giving to other human, sinful human beings
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.020]   to take care of.
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.900]   I mean, we're selfish and we're lazy and we have all our problems.
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:18.420]   Then you put another human being in that situation, you would think like, "God, what are you doing?"
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:26.420]   Why does God use these disciples who are fishermen who have already failed to carry out His greatest
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.700]   and perfect plan?
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:28.700]   Why?
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:34.220]   You would think that out of His salvation plan, that every part of that would be perfect.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:41.380]   But whenever you come to human beings, you pick Peter?
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:47.100]   John and James wanted to kill a whole community because they wouldn't receive Him?
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:53.580]   Paul, who murdered the first Christian, he's going to be a representative to the Gentiles?
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.180]   The church?
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:59.980]   These people were constantly fighting about who's the greatest in the kingdom?
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:04.780]   Why would God use us for that purpose?
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:10.140]   Why does He allow us to experience this process of growing up and raising children?
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:15.720]   Obviously, today is Mother's Day, and I think starting from about last year when Jeremy
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.060]   started driving, I feel a little bit more free.
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.900]   Before, Mother's Day was go-to-work Father's Day.
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.140]   Like that's what it was for me all these years.
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.660]   And I know it's like that for some of you guys.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:30.900]   It's Mother's Day, so you made little cards and made it look like your kid did it, you
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.060]   know, but you did it, right?
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:37.060]   You have to work extra hard, and you don't realize how much work goes into just making
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.060]   breakfast.
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:42.140]   If you don't cook breakfast every day, that's a lot of work just making breakfast, right?
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:46.300]   So all these other years, like, you know, I would have to wake up early and pretend
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.620]   like the kids did it.
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:51.740]   So I'd wake them up, and you know, and some of them are in the kitchen, and we're doing
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.060]   stuff, and usually something's burnt.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:56.060]   You know, the eggs don't quite turn out the way it is.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.900]   And usually the food that we end up eating on Mother's Day is the worst food the whole
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.340]   year, usually, right?
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:06.580]   Now part of it is because I'm not good at it, and then the other part of it is because
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.920]   I involve my kids.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.820]   If we want to have good breakfast, the best thing to do is to order out.
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:14.660]   That would be the best thing to do, right?
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.900]   Find out what she likes, and then go order it, bring it, and then say, "Happy Mother's
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.620]   Day," and then go back to bed, right?
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:24.700]   But every Mother's Day, we're kind of like, "Okay, we have to go get the kids," and I
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.540]   can't just go and buy it because it wouldn't mean as much, so I got to drag the kids, and
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.580]   then I got to tell her, "We did it."
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.540]   Actually, I did it, but we said, "Tell her we did it," right?
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.380]   For the last couple years, it's become more and more independent, so now the kids are
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.380]   a little bit older.
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:43.180]   Jeremy's got a job, and the other kids have a little bit of money, so starting from yesterday,
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.660]   I was like, "What are you doing?
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:45.660]   What are you doing?"
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.180]   So they went out and got bagels, flowers.
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:52.620]   Faith was in charge of the decoration, and they all had their little parts, and they
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:56.340]   did it, and literally, I didn't have to do anything.
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.340]   And I showed up.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.540]   So one part, I was very satisfied.
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:01.900]   I was like, "Wow, the kids are, now they're able to do it themselves."
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.340]   And the other part of me was like, "Where's my breakfast?"
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:10.380]   Anyway, that has nothing to do with the sermon.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:15.500]   That's just something I thought.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.660]   And so going through all that, I said, "Oh, okay, now the kids are," you know?
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.900]   But even after all of that, right?
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.500]   I mean, Esther's breakfast is the best, to me.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.700]   You know, it's Mother's Day, but it's like, okay, you know, thank God every day is not
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.160]   Mother's Day, or else we wouldn't be eating well, right?
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.380]   Why go through all that process?
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.220]   Because the point of that process is to teach the kids, right?
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:43.580]   And I said, "Yeah, every year that we've done that, something was burnt, or eggs weren't
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:48.100]   cooked properly, the coffee didn't taste right, you know what I mean?
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.220]   Just not as good as when Esther usually does it.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.380]   But why do we go through that process?
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.620]   Why do we go through that drama and the headache?"
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:58.860]   Because the point of it is to teach the kids the importance that even if it's burnt, you
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:39:59.860]   know?
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.820]   I mean, we can have the best breakfast if I just spent enough money, went and got it,
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.120]   and just put it in front of her.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:09.380]   But the point of it was to give honor, and to say thank you, even with the burnt toast,
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.380]   right?
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.420]   With the burnt whatever, to say, "We love you."
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:20.700]   So the message and the gift is in the effort, is in the fumbling around, right?
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:24.780]   Why did God give us moms?
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:29.740]   And go through all that trouble, with all that mess, with all the sinfulness and problems,
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:32.920]   in the context of all that, is revealing who He is.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.160]   How He loves us.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:39.800]   That even in the context of sharing the Gospel, He's not just interested in sharing the Gospel.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.980]   He's interested in us sharing the Gospel.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.960]   He's not just interested in making disciples.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.980]   He's interested in us, in the process of making disciples.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:51.360]   He wasn't just concerned about the lost world.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:56.340]   He was concerned about Peter, learning about the heart of God, in the context of being
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.820]   broken for the lost.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.120]   That's why He involves us.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.940]   That's why we have moms.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:04.880]   That's why we have dads.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:10.640]   Because God is not simply concerned about the best toast that we can make.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:16.540]   God is concerned about the process of us saying, "Thank you, God, for what you've done."
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:22.380]   And that is why the Scripture tells us, "Honor your father and mother."
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:26.720]   And it's the first commandment that comes with the promise, that we will live long and
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.720]   be blessed.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:37.260]   If we know how to recognize God's common grace, His love, His mercy, that He's shown
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:43.120]   us through the people that is most intimate in us, with us, then we will learn and understand
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.120]   who He is.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.400]   Let me read it again, Ephesians 4, 6, 1-3.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.940]   "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.400]   Honor your father and mother."
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:58.400]   This is the first commandment with a promise, that it may go well with you, and that you
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.460]   may live long in the land.
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:04.260]   If you can take a minute to pray with me as I ask the praise team to come up.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:11.260]   And again, I want to take some time to invite you to pray.
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:15.740]   I know some of us come from homes that maybe you don't have a great relationship with your
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.660]   mom.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:24.180]   Whatever relationship that we have, again, we know we live in a sinful world.
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:29.440]   We're sinful, our parents are sinful, everyone that we've experienced life with is sinful.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:35.100]   So therefore, sometimes we're going to have sinful experiences.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:39.720]   But part of what it means to be a Christian is to redeem what was lost.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.140]   To restore what was lost at the fall.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.960]   The effects of the sin that we've experienced in our families, in our relationship, that
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:51.240]   all of this stuff, because Christ first loved us, we love.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.520]   Because he first loved us.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:59.040]   The most tangible way for us to say thank you to God is learn to say thank you to the
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.600]   people who are laboring in your life.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.440]   Who have labored in your life.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.440]   Learn to say thank you to them as a way of honoring and glorifying God.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:11.280]   I know some of you guys come from homes where parents aren't Christians.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.200]   And the greatest gift that you can pray for for them is their own salvation.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.180]   Not only to know your love, but the love that God gave you, that your parents would also
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.940]   know that same love.
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.720]   There's no greater gift that you can pray for for your parents than for that.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:29.340]   So take some time to come and pray that one day that God would open their eyes.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:35.000]   That they may experience this intimate love that you and I have been affected by.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.560]   And again, for the rest of us, that this application isn't really just about moms.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.680]   Ultimately, it's about our Heavenly Father.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:49.720]   He came and experienced life as a child and grew up and was crucified.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.000]   That He may become a sympathetic High Priest.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.160]   So that He may understand us and we may understand Him.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:01.440]   That we would come before the Lord and recognize that as we think of our mothers and their
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:08.440]   love for us, how much more when the scripture says, "Can a nursing mom forget his child?"
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:12.480]   And even if they do, I will not.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:17.280]   That we come before the Lord, ultimately, the greatest love and gift that you've experienced
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.640]   ultimately is because God cared for you.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.680]   That on this Mother's Day, as we celebrate our moms, that you would look even beyond
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:29.680]   our moms and thank the Heavenly Father who has given you common grace to bring you where
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.600]   you are because of His grace in your life.
