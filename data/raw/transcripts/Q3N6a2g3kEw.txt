[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   >> Good morning, church family.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Happy Easter and Resurrection Sunday.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It is a privilege and joy to celebrate this day together with you all.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And as we celebrate his resurrection, I am reminded of the great hope that we have in Christ.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   The hope of salvation from our sins.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   The hope of eternal life after death.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And the hope that one day we will see Jesus in full glory.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It is this kind of hope that lifts me through any trial or affliction or season in life.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And I pray this hope moves us to live a life of obedience and worship to him as we eagerly await the day that we will meet him.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Let's sing "I'm Forgiven."
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   I'm forgiven because you were forsaken.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I'm accepted.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   You were condemned.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I'm alive and well.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Your spirit is within me because you died and rose again.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Amazing love, how can it be that you, my king, would die for me?
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Amazing love, I know it's true.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   It's my joy to honor you in all I do.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I honor you and I forgive you.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I'm forgiven because you were forsaken.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I'm accepted.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   You were condemned.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I'm alive and well.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Your spirit is within me because you died and rose again.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Amazing love, how can it be that you, my king, would die for me?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Amazing love, I know it's true.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   It's my joy to honor you in all I do.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I honor you.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   You are my king.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   You are my king.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   You are my king.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Jesus, you are my king.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Jesus, you are my king.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Amazing love, how can it be that you, my king, would die for me?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Amazing love, I know it's true.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   It's my joy to honor you.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Amazing love.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Amazing love, how can it be that you, my king, would die for me?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Amazing love, I know it's true.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   It's my joy to honor you in all I do.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I honor you in all I do.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I honor you.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   All right, good morning, and welcome
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   to Bering Community Church.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Let me get a few announcements before we get started,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   if I can find it.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   All right, here it is.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   All right, again, happy Resurrection Sunday.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   It was a busy week.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   I know some of you guys were here early in the morning,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   and you were serving, and you're a little bit tired, and so am I.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I took an extra shot of caffeine so that I won't be falling asleep today.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   But just a few announcements before we get started.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   First of all, Women's Ministry Conference.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   That's happening on April 13th from 8 to 1230.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   They said today is the last day to sign up, so if you haven't signed up,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   so please go online and sign up as soon as you can.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   FAM 245 Workshop, that's happening on April 20th at 1030.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Please sign up for that as well.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Members Meeting, that's coming up on April 21st.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   If you want to be a member of the church,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   membership class is beginning on April 21st until June 9th.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   So that's 930 to 1050.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   So if you're a college student, it will be finished before your quarter is over.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   So that's how they fit that schedule in.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And then Brein Service Auction.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Those of you who are volunteering a service or you're donating something,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   the last day to do that will be this coming Saturday.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And then the actual auction is happening on April 21st through the 27th.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   But if you are volunteering something,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   they are still taking donations or services that are happening until April 6th.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   The special seminar on abortion, birth control, and IVF
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   that's happening on May 4th, and we're going to keep pushing this
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   because we want to have as many of our church people to come out as possible.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   It is not limited to members.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   So you can invite non-members to come to that, but that's taking place on 9 to 12.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And there's no fee involved, so please sign up for that.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   There will be sign-ups online if you are interested in signing up for that.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Men's softball tournament, you're going to get an announcement soon.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   If you are interested in playing, that's happening on May 18th.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And then the women's softball within church softball day is going to be happening on May 26th.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   There are other things. We'll kind of leave that for another time.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   But today, after the service, there is lunch provided,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   but because of the rain and various things, they had to move it inside.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   So if you go into the cafe area—oh, no, no, no.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   A serving station is going to be outside, and they're going to give you a little name tag
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   so that you can try to fellowship and get to know each other a little bit better while you're here.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   So you can go into the cafe or that area to eat,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   or if you want to just grab it and take it home, you can also do that,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   but lunch will be provided after the service.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   I'm going to ask our choir team to come up, and as they are coming up—
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   again, I heard it the first time, and I was so blessed by the choir.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   All I kept thinking was, "I get to hear this three times today."
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   So they're going to come up, and then as they set up, I'm going to pray for the offering.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And as I mentioned before, today is the last day that we're going to be able to receive offerings outside of Subsplash.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Starting from next Sunday, anything outside of Subsplash is going to be shut down.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   So either you're going to have to bring a physical offering, or you're going to have to use Subsplash, okay?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   All right, let me pray for us.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Father, we thank you so much for your continual blessing in our lives.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   We thank you for what this day means for all of us,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   that you've brought hope, you've brought life,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   you've brought eternity, Lord God, where we can be in your presence because of what Christ has done.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   I pray that this Resurrection Sunday would have the deep impact on our thinking, on our lives,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   and how we deal with the rest of the world.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   We pray that you would bless us, bless this time,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   that what we give to you would be an abundant gratitude of our hearts,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   and may this offering be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   [music]
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   [music]
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   How I long to breathe the air of heaven
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Pain is gone and mercy fills the streets
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   To look upon the one who bled to save me
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And walk with Him all eternity
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   There will be a day when all will bow before Him
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   There will be a day when death will be no more
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Standing face to face with He who died and rose again
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Holy, holy is the Lord
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   And every prayer and every great desperation
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Songs of faith we sing through doubt and fear
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   In the end we'll see that it was worth it
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   When He returns to wipe away our tears
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   There will be a day when all will bow before Him
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   There will be a day when death will be no more
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Standing face to face with He who died and rose again
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Holy, holy is the Lord
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   And on that day we join the resurrection
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   And stand beside the heroes of the faith
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   With one voice a thousand generations
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Sing worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And on that day we join the resurrection
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   And stand beside the heroes of the faith
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   With one voice a thousand generations
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Sing worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Forever He shall reign
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   So let it be today
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   We shout the name of heaven
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   With angels and the saints
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   We raise a mighty roar
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Glory to our God
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Who gave us life beyond the grave
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Holy, holy is the Lord
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   So let it be today
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   We shout the name of heaven
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   With angels and the saints
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   We raise a mighty roar
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Glory to our God
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Who gave us life beyond the grave
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Holy, holy is the Lord
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   [applause]
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Let us all rise as we continue our service,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   and let's spend a few moments just to greet
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   the neighbors around us.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Let us all rise as we continue our service,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   and let's spend a few moments just to greet
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   the neighbors around us.

[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   the neighbors around us.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Let us all rise as we continue our service,

[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   the neighbors around us.

[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   springs eternal.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Oh, sing
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Hallelujah!
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Now and ever
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   we confess.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Christ our hope
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   in life and death.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Oh, sing
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Hallelujah!
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Our hope
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   springs
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   eternal.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Oh, sing
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Hallelujah!
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Now and ever
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   we confess.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Christ our hope
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   in life and death.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Now and ever
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   we confess.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Christ our hope
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   in life and death.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Amen. You may be seated.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   If you can turn your Bibles to Deuteronomy chapter 28.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Deuteronomy 28.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   I'll be reading from verses 1
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   through 7.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   And then verse 15 to verse
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   20.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   Now it shall be if you
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   diligently obey the Lord your God, being careful
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   to do all his commandments which I command
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   you today, the Lord your God
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   will set you high above all the nations of the
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   earth. All these blessings will come
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   upon you and overtake you if you
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   obey the Lord your God. Blessed
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   shall you be in the city and blessed shall you be
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   in the country. Blessed shall you
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   be offspring of your body
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   and the produce of your ground and the offspring
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   of your beast, the increase of your herd
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   and the young of your flock.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Blessed shall be your
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   basket and your kneading bowl. Blessed
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   shall you be when you come
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   in and blessed shall you be when you go out.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   The Lord shall cause your enemies
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   who rise up against you to be defeated before
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   you. They will come out against you one
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   way and flee before you seven
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   ways. Verse 15.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   But it shall come about if you do not
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   obey the Lord your God, to observe to do
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   all his commandments and his statutes with
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   which I charge you today, that
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   all these curses will come upon you and
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   overtake you. Cursed shall you
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   be in the city and cursed shall you be
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   in the country. Cursed shall you be
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   your basket and your kneading bowl. Cursed
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   shall you be the offsprings of your
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   body and the produce of your ground
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   and increase of your herd and the
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   young of your flock. Cursed shall
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   you be when you come in. Cursed shall you be
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   when you go out. The Lord will send
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   upon you curses, confusion and rebuke
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   and all that you undertake
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   to do until you are
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   destroyed and until you perish quickly
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   on account of the evil of your deeds because
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   you have forsaken me. Let's pray.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Father,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   give us
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   understanding.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Help us to know
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   your heart, your mind,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   your purpose and intent.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   I pray that you would
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   help us to understand the deep,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   deep love of Christ.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Together with all the saints,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   that your word would have the
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   impact that you've intended. In
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   As you already
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   know, all over the world
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   all the people who claim Christ
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   was crucified
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   on the cross have gathered together to
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   celebrate this day. Christianity
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   rises and falls on this
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   particular day.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Some people who don't understand
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   may say it doesn't really matter
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   if you have evidence, it doesn't matter if the Bible
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   is really from God as long as it does
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   something for you. As long as
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   it's good for you.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Now, Jesus
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   himself said
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   that he was going to leave a sign.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   The sign of Jonah, his death and resurrection.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And if the resurrection
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   can be proven to be false,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   then everything that you've been doing up to this
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   point was a waste of time. Every dollar
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   that you've donated to the church
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   was a waste. All that
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   hard-earned money.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Trying to love people that
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   don't love you. I mean, there's
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   nothing more draining and tiresome
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   to love people that are difficult to love.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Every effort that
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   you've put in because of what
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   you say you believe, if the resurrection didn't
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   happen, all of this was a waste
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   of time. The biggest lie ever told.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   But if the resurrection
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   did take place,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   and Jesus Christ really is the son of God,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   then this is the greatest
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   blessing that mankind has
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   ever received. There's no single
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   act, no single event
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   in human history that has impacted
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   the world than
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   this resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Some of you,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   whether you've been coming a long time,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   or whether you've just visited us today,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   in some sense, whether you
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   articulate it or not, we come
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   to church seeking some kind of
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   blessing from God. Maybe I'll
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   receive a blessing from the sermon. Maybe I'll receive
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   a blessing from our community, from
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   people. The way
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   we dish out blessings,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   you know, like, man
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   has no authority to do that.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   I can say, "God bless you."
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Right?
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   All I did was wave my hand. Nothing
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   happened. There's no magic coming out of my
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   hands. I don't have any authority or power
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   to bless you. Right?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   That's why whenever we conduct weddings,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   there's
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   no power in any of the
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   pastors to say, "God's going to bless
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   this wedding," unless we're sure
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   that God has already blessed this
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   union. So we can't
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   stand and have
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   marriage ceremonies and oversee marriage
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   ceremonies that we're not confident that this is
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   going to be blessed by God.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   All we're doing is representing
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   what God has already ordained, and
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   we're just representing and saying what He would say.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   But if I'm not confident that God's
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   going to bless it, I don't have any power
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   in and of
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   ourselves to bless you.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   That power only
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   belongs to somebody who has authority and
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   power to do that.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   And in the same way, we curse.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   We bless people that
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   we like, and then we curse
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   people we don't like.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   I don't have any power over that either.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   It's just wishful thinking. We bless people
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   that we like, and then we curse people
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   that we don't like. But our
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   curses mean nothing. It's just words.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   It's just an expression of how I feel.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   But there's no power behind any curse
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   because in order to be able to bless or
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   curse anybody, you have to have some sort of
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   authority, and you have to have some sort of power
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   to back that up.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   And so we know that only
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   God has that power to bless you.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   And only God has that power to
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   curse you. The text
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   that we're looking at in Deuteronomy 28,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   just to give you a background.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   The nation of Israel has been wandering the desert
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   for 40 years. They're about to enter the
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   promised land, and
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   God is establishing
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   the laws that will
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   govern this land.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   So up to this point, He's been laying out
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   these are the laws. This is how it should be
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   organized. These are how the leaders
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   are established. These are the laws that you are to
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   do, you are to keep on the Sabbath.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And after He gives the law, He says
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   if you do not,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   if you do not
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   obey them, here's the consequences. If you do
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   obey them, here's the blessing. And that's what basically
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   chapter 28 is.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   28 is a
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   promise if you obey,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   and it is a warning
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   if you disobey.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   The condition
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   of His blessing is clear.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   He doesn't just
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   dish it out.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   He's just a benevolent God who
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   no matter what you do,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   He's going to bless you. Imagine living
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   in a society where there is no consequence
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   for your behavior.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   As some of you guys know,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   we've been having a lot of problems in
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   particular in certain states, and this
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   state included, that because
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   they have, some districts have
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   openly said we're not going to punish crime,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   certain kinds of crime, and so
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   shoplifting and vandalism
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   and theft has skyrocketed.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   And as a result of that, it's created
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   chaos. And so people
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   are leaving certain cities.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   And even the state.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Imagine living in a
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   culture where there is no punishment
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   for disobedience.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   It's lawlessness.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Law is required
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   in order to have peace.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   It is required.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   And so God is laying out
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   these are the blessings that will come upon you
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   if you obey my commandments.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Chapter 28, verse 1.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   If you diligently obey the Lord your God,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   being careful to do all His commandments
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   which I command you today, the Lord your God
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   will set you high above
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   all the nations of the earth.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   First 14 verses
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   basically says that this is what's going to
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   happen to you if you obey.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   The first thing that
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   He says in verse 2-6 is
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   prosperity in everything that you do.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   He says, verse 2, all these
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   blessings will come upon you and
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   overtake you if you obey the Lord your God.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   The word for overtake
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   is a really interesting, it's a rich word.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   It means to be consumed.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   To be overpowered.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Meaning, you're not going to be
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   able to fight it.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   I remember when I was younger, for whatever
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   the reason, me and my older brother, we're built
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   the same way. We're both short
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   and stocky. But for whatever the
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   reason, he was way faster.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   So if ever I ticked him off and I tried
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   to run away from him, I knew
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   he was going to overtake me. Because he's
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   much faster than I am. So when I
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   read this word, he's going to overtake you,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   I have that image
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   that come to mind when I was younger, that
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   when my brother is angry, I cannot
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   escape. That's
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   the imagery.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   The word in Hebrew basically
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   means that there's such intimate
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   connection with God's blessing
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   and you, that even if
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   you try to run from it, you can't. It's going to
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   overtake you.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And so, the description that he gives us
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   in verse 2-6, it says, "Blessed shall you
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   be in the city, and blessed shall
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   you be in the country." In other words,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   when you're a man or a woman
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   that is blessed, it doesn't
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   matter where you live. You know, we think
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   that, "Oh, if I can live in this city over that
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   city, if I can go here or there." He says,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   "No. If the blessing of God
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   has overtaken you because you are obedient
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   to the law of God, you're
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   not going to be escaped." It doesn't matter where you live.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   It doesn't matter who surrounds you, whether you
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   are in the city or in the country.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   "Blessed shall be the offspring of your body,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   and the produce of your ground, and the offspring of
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   your beasts, and the increase of the herd, and your
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   young, of your flock." He's talking about your work.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   It doesn't matter
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   what kind of job you have, how much you get paid, or
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   what field you're in. He says, "If God
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   blesses you, everything you
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   touch is going to be blessed."
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   The blessing doesn't belong
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   in a particular area, in a particular
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   job.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   He says, "No. The blessing goes upon
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   with that person." So whatever that person
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   does, in the city,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   in the country, at work,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   everything you touch is going to be blessed.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   "Blessed shall be your basket, and your
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   kneading bowl. Blessed shall you be when you come
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   in, and blessed shall you be when you go
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   out."
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   You won't even be able to escape
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   it, even if you wanted to.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Everything you do is going to
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   be blessed. Even the things
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   that other people may look at and say, "Wow,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   man, that must be hard."
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   But if you're blessed, even
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   in the hardest circumstance,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   you will be blessed.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   That's what he says. Secondly, he
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   says, "Your enemies will not be able to
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   overtake you." Verse 7, "The Lord shall cause
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   your enemies who rise up against you
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   to be defeated before you. They
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   will come out against you one way, and will flee
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   before you seven ways."
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   You know what I thought was interesting about
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   this promise? He doesn't say
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   that you're not going to have enemies.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   If you're blessed, your enemies
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   still exist, they just aren't going to be able to overpower
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   you.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   Even your enemies, even the people who
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   have intent on evil against you,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   you don't have to worry because God
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   has his blessing upon you.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   They won't be able to
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   overpower you.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Finally, chapter 20, verse 9,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   he says, "The Lord
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   will establish you as a holy people to
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   himself, as he swore to you, if you
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   keep the commandments of the Lord your God, and walk
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   in his ways." In other words,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   the word "holy" basically means to be set apart.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   That he's going to
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   identify you, and set
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   you apart, and possess you as
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   his own.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   You know what that means? That if
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   we belong to God,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   that everything that we have,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   everything that he has, is going to overflow to
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   us. If I win the lottery
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   today, the first
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   person that's going to
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   be a beneficiary of that
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   is my wife.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   As soon as I win,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   she's not going to be like, "Oh, I
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   wish I could win."
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   We win together, right?
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Because she's my wife. My children
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   are going to celebrate, "Oh, my dad is rich!"
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   And then my family,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   my brothers, my mom, we're all
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   going to benefit. And then you will benefit, because I'll
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   buy that building behind us and make it into a gym.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Right?
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Because I'm your pastor.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   So when God says,
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   "You will be my people,"
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   it's an expression of his blessing.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   That everything
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   you do, everything you touch, if God's
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   blessing is upon it,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   you don't have to worry, "Oh, I'm afraid
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   should I go to this school, or that school, or
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   should I do this, or should I do that?"
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   No, if the Lord blesses you,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   whatever
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   you do, he says, you will see the
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   blessing of God.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   But,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   in verse 15, he says, "It shall come
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   about, if you do not obey the Lord your
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   God, to observe, to do
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   all his commandments and his statutes,
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   with which I charge you today, that all
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   these curses will come upon you and
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   overtake you." Exactly the
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   opposite. Just like you couldn't run from
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   God's blessing, he says, you're not going to be
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   able to run from his curse.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   He says in verse 17 to 20,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   "Hardship will come into your life.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Curse shall you be,
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   your baskets and your kneading bowl.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Curse shall be the offspring of your
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   body, and the produce of your ground, the increase
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   of your herd, and the young of your flock."
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Everything that
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   you do, no matter what kind of job
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   you get, no matter where you live, in the city
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   or out of the city, he says, you're
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   going to feel the curse in your life.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   No matter who you
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   marry, no matter what
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   you endeavor, no matter how much money you have in the bank,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   he says, you're going to feel that curse
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   in your life. It's going to overtake
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   you. "Curse shall you be when you come in.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Curse shall you be when you go out.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   The Lord will send upon
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   you curses of confusion and
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   rebuke in all you undertake to do
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   until you are destroyed."
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   He said that curse
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   isn't temporary. You don't just get a
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   slap in the hand and you somehow
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   pay off your curse and then you're going to move on to
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   blessing. He said that curse is going to be
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   upon you until the day that
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   you die on account of the evil
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   deeds that you've done
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   because you have forsaken me.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   And on top of that,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   verse 25 to 29, he says that your
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   enemies are going to rise
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   up and every single one
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   of them are going to overtake you. And then
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   verse 38 to 42 says, "Desolation
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   is going to come upon the land."
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   If you read
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   the blessings and
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   curses in this passage, you've probably
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   already noticed that the
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   promise of blessing is only 14
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   verses.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   And there's 54 verses
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   of warning about curses.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   In fact, if you
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   read the rest of Deuteronomy, there's 72
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   verses dedicated to the warning
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   of curses. It's almost
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   like the blessing, promise
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   of blessing is kind of like something
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   that had to be said.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   But the main point is
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   so that you understand the curse.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   And if that's how you read
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   it, you read it correctly.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   You read it correctly because
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   the point of this is that these
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   are the things that you're going to miss out on, but these
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   are the things that's going to come upon you.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Some of us may look at that and
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   say, "Well, this doesn't look like the God that I
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   know of the New Testament.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   This is not the God that
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   I was taught when I was in Sunday school."
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Well,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   if it isn't, then you weren't
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   taught the right gospel. Because what
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   I'm reading to you is just straight out of the Bible.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   And I will show you
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   that the God of the Old
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   Testament is exactly the
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   same God as the New Testament.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   He is just as gracious
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   and merciful and patient
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   in the Old Testament as the New Testament. And the God of the
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   New Testament is just as righteous
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   and holy and hates sin
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   as much as the God of the Old Testament.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   It's the same God.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   Some of us may look at this and say,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   "I don't want to read the Old Testament
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   because it's just a downer.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Curse upon curse upon curse."
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   Well, let me make it very clear
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   what the Bible says about who God is.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Ezekiel 33, 11, it says, "Say to them, 'As I live,'
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   declares the Lord God, 'I take
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   no pleasure in the death of the wicked,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   but rather that the wicked turn from his ways
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   and live. Turn back, turn back from your
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   evil ways. Why then will you die, O
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   house of Israel?'"
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   The Bible makes it very clear.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Even though He warns them, even though
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   there's five times more warning
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   about the judgment that is coming,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   He says His
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   intent or His desire is not
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   to see them punished.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   In fact, in Jeremiah 29, 11,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   what is Jeremiah known for?
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   What kind of prophet
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   is he?
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Weeping
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   prophet. He's called a weeping prophet
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   not because he's sanguine
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   or he has depression.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   He's just a sad guy.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   They call him the weeping prophet because
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   every time he opened his mouth,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   he was declaring
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   judgment upon Israel.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   They hated when he talked
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   because it depressed people.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   And that's why they call him the weeping prophet
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   because all his life he wept
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   over Israel.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   And God told Jeremiah to
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   take the message that nobody wanted
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   to hear. But in
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   the context of this condemnation,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   it says in Jeremiah 29,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   "For I know the plans that I have for
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   you," declares the Lord, "plans of welfare
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   and not for calamity to give
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   you a future and a hope."
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   Now, who
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   would have gotten that from Jeremiah's message?
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   You would have thought
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   if you heard and read Jeremiah,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Jeremiah, that God is
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   eager to bring punishment upon Israel.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   He is ticked off and He's just going to let you have it.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   But Jeremiah
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   clarifies
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   the reason why this is happening
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   is not so that you will be punished.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   It's so that you will turn from your sins
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   because God desires what's best.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   And it is no
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   different with Deuteronomy 28.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   As much as He warns us
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   about the curses,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   the reason behind this curse
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   is to bring us to righteousness.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   He
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   tells us in chapter 29,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   19-20, why there is
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   an abundance of
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   warning of curses.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   And let me just
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   take a minute
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   to help you to recalibrate.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   If you lived
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   all your life
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   as a Christian,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   have a
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   sunny disposition
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   of the world because God
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   we're in spiritual Disneyland.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   Happiest place on earth.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   And so we met Christ,
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   we have abundant life,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   and life is good already, but when we go to heaven,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   when we go to heaven, we're going to be in heaven for eternity.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   Right?
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   You have
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   to have a paradigm shift
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   or else the gospel doesn't make sense.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   Or else there's
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   parts of the Bible that's not going to make any sense.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Or else the application of what
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   you think what God desires
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   is going to be completely off.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   And let me tell you why.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   He explains why
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   He mentions more curses than blessing
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   in verse 19. "It shall be when He
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   hears the words of the curse that He will
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   boast." And that word "boast"
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   in some translations says that He blesses
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   Himself. Even in the midst
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   of tremendous
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   rebellion against God,
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   He feels blessed.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   Because His bills are paid.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   Found a good wife. Found a good husband.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   Children are doing well.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   My business is going well. So I feel blessed.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   He says,
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   He basically says,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   "I have peace though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   in order to destroy the watered land
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   with the dry."
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   In order to shake the peace of those
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   who are under condemnation and they are not
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   aware of it.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   That they're going to meet
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   a holy, holy, holy
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   God when they die.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   And they're not aware of it.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   And they live the rest of their lives.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   God bless me.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   I'm so blessed. I'm so blessed.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Because He blesses Himself.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   "The Lord shall never be willing to forgive
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   Him, but rather the anger of the Lord
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   and His jealousy will burn against that man
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   and every curse which is written
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   in this book will rest on Him
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   and the Lord will blot out His name
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   from under heaven."
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   In order
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   to humble the man.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   He says.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   Now let me illustrate why this is
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   so important.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   A man
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   who has cancer.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   In order for the doctor
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   to
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   give the treatment, he has to
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   first convince the patient that he has cancer.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   Now the patient
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   may say, "I don't
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   feel anything. I don't feel any symptoms."
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   But they found that out through the
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   MRI, through x-ray. They did some blood
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   tests and said it's clear. It's 100%.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   It's cancer. But you don't
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   feel it. But in order to treat that cancer
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   you need to do chemo.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   You need to do some harsh treatment
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   that initially may hurt
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   your body but in the long run
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   it's going to save you.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   But until that patient
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   is convinced that
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   there is a sickness and disease
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   that's going to lead to death
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   the doctor
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   is not going to be able to treat him
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   with chemotherapy.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   The scripture tells us that the law
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   was given to sinners that sin
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   would become utterly
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   sinful.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   In other words, the patient
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   will come to the conclusion
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   that he needs a doctor.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   That he needs treatment.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   Because the most
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   dangerous place for a
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   sinner to be is to be
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   in sin and does not
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   recognize the curse that he is under.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   And he is constantly
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   thinking that if he just changes his circumstance
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   that maybe because I met the wrong wife. Maybe
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   because I met the wrong husband.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Maybe if I made this decision. Maybe if I
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   had the right career
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   that I can change my life
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   not realizing, he says, the curse
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   has overtaken you.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   That what you are experiencing in life
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   is not just bad judgment but the curse
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   that you are under.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   In fact, Apostle Paul
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   tells us this very thing in
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   Romans chapter 7.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   Living all his life trying to obey
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   the law as a Pharisee
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   among Pharisees. And this is the
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   conclusion he came to. For we know that the law
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   is spiritual but I am of the flesh.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   I am sold into the bondage to sin.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   For what
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   I am doing I do not understand.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   For I am not practicing what I would like to do
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   but I am doing the very thing I
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   hate. Here is a Jew
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   who lived all his life trying to obey
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   the law and the end conclusion
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   was he realized
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   that he is a sinner.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   The very thing
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   that I did. I know that the law is good.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   That is why I want to do it.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   But the more he tried to earn
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   righteousness the more he realizes his
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   corruption. Verse 18 and 19. For I know
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   that nothing good dwells in me.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   I know that nothing good dwells in me.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   How did he learn this?
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Through the law. Because sin
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   became utterly sinful.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   That is in my flesh for the
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   willingness is present in me but the doing
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   of the good is not. For the good that I want
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   I do not do but I practice the very
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   evil that I do not want.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   He was a good
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Jew. He was a Pharisee.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   He knew that the law was good. That God
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   gave the law. God didn't
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   give them something evil but he said
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   through the practice
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   or the pursuit of the law he realized
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   nothing good is in me. And then
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   conclusion. This is
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   where God was trying to bring all
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   of Israel and all of sinners to this
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   very point in chapter 7
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   21 to 24. I find then the principle that is
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   evil is present in me. The one who
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   wants to do good. For I joyfully
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   concur with the law of God in the inner man
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   but I see a different law in the members of my
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   body. Waging war against the law
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   of my mind and making me a prisoner of the
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   law of sin which is in my
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   members. What a
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   wretched man that I am.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Who will set me free
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   from the body of this death?
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   This is where God wants to bring
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   all sinners to this point.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   Oh what a wretched man
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   that I am.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   Who will save me from
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   this?
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   Christ's death means nothing to
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   a sinner who does not
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   recognize the curse that
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   he's under.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   The resurrection means nothing to a man
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   where he just
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   well I accept Jesus and things are good
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   and hopefully when I get to heaven that I can have a good
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   life and have a nice mansion and
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   it means nothing to a man
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   who does not recognize
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   the curse that he's under.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   Because he doesn't realize
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   his wretchedness.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   Because his bills are paid.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   Because things are good. Got a good job.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   Takes vacation when
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   they want. Saving enough
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   money for retirement.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   And he
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   blesses himself even though
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   his life is lived in rebellion.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   God gives us the law
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   like a doctor
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   to present
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   to sinners
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   that without the
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   savior this is your state. It's the curse
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   that you're in.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   Well who's under this curse?
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   Romans 3 23 "For all have sinned
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   All have sinned
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   There's not a single person who's lived on this earth
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   who tried to gain righteousness
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   through the law
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   who's not under the curse.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   Whether you have the law or don't
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   have the law you are cursed under the law.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   It's not the law Paul says in Romans.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   But we're all under a curse.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   Galatians 3 10 it says "For as many
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   as are of the works of the law are under a
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   curse. For it is written
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   "Curse is everyone who does not
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   abide by all things written in the
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   book of the law to perform them."
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   All mankind are under this curse.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   I want that to really sink in.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   Because we're taught
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   that if you work hard
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   and get a good job
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   go to the right school
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   hopefully you'll
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   meet a pretty girl
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   decent looking guy
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   who isn't
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   too dirty
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   and comes from a decent family
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   has a decent job
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   and you can get married
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   take some vacations work hard
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   raise up decent children and if you
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   find the right place to live
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   and make some right decisions
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   invest in the right things that you will
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   be blessed.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   But the problem is
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   the longer you
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   live
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   the longer you live
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   the more you realize the effects of this curse.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   Whether you have a house or don't have a house
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   whether you're married or not married
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   whether you meet one person or not person
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   not another person
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   you feel the effects
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   of the curse
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   the longer you live on this earth.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   And we think
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   we convince ourselves that if we can
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   just tweak our lives a little bit
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   if we can change our circumstances
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   if we can find the right person
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   and invest in Bitcoin at the right time
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   that I can be
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   blessed.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   The greatest problem of mankind
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   is that he does not understand
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   the wrath
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   that he is under.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   Romans 1.18 says
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   for the wrath of God is being revealed
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   is revealed from heaven
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   who suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   That word revealed, the wrath of God
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   revealed is in the present tense.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   It's happening now.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   It's not future.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   The wrath of God will be revealed or
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   wrath of God was revealed. It says the wrath of God
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   is being revealed.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   You know what that means?
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   Everything that we do
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   that mankind does
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   wherever he lives
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   whatever he endeavors
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   whatever he touches
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   whatever technology he creates
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   will see the touch of the curse.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   Look at
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   our lives.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   Look at how many fantastic things were created
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   just in the last 20 years. The internet
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   the phone
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   but as
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   soon as it's created
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   what is it used for?
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   Pornography.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   Identity theft.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   Distraction.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   Jealousy.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   Coveting.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   In and of itself is not evil
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   but whatever man touches
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   you will know the curse.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   And that's what he was warning.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   Before the doctor
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   can be useful
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   understand the curse that he's under.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   You know
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   I don't know if you heard
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   yesterday
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   the president of the
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   United States Biden has declared
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   this resurrection Sunday
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   as transgender
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   visible day.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   Awareness day.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   Don't tell me
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   he didn't know this was his most
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   sacred day
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   for Christians.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   Don't tell me that was by accident.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   And I'm not just picking on Biden
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   although
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   that sin is particularly
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   egregious.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   It says all have
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   The wrath of God is being revealed
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   the Bible also says the wrath of God
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   the curse of God is being stored up.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   Can you imagine thousands of years
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   of sinners shaking
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   their fists at God.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   And so the typical
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   question that we get from non-Christians is
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   how can a good God do this to us?
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   You know why they ask that question?
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   It's because he thinks he's
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   under the blessing.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   He doesn't realize there's a curse upon him.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   If he knew that there was a curse upon him
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   that's not the question he would be asking.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   The question he would be asking is
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   why did I wake up today?
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   Why does he not crush me today?
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   If I'm under a curse
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   why does he put up with me today?
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   It's because he does not understand
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   and because the church has passed out
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   the blessing of God like it's Halloween candy
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   that we have a world
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   filled with people who said
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   if God loves me unconditionally
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   why does he allow all this evil to happen?
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   When the clear teaching of the Bible
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   tells us the reason why
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   we see all the evils in the world
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   is because of the curse
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   of God.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   Everything man touches
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   turns into a curse.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   See but
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   the story does not end there.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   He does all of that
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   so that he may save us.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   In Galatians 3.13
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   having become a curse for us for it is written
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   cursed is everyone who hangs
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   on a tree.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   He declared the curse
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   and he didn't simply say
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   get your act straight.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   You know
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   what's really
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   encouraging this morning our brother Sammy
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   during the early
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   service he gave a testimony
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   and he used to live in LA and he moved to
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   Orange County and he said the main reason why he moved
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   is because his home got robbed four times.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   If you've ever been robbed
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   your home in particular
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   you know how that feels. Our family got
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   robbed a couple times when we were young
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   I didn't want to go home because I didn't feel safe
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   you know and it's a strange
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   feeling to go home and not feel safe.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   You lock the
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   door so that you can
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   sleep in peace at night but when your home
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   gets robbed locking the door actually
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   is unsettling.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   What if somebody's in the
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   house? He said he got robbed
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   four times and he said honestly he said we came
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   to Orange County to get away from the crime.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   A lot of people are leaving California
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   for the same reason thinking that if I go to
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   Texas or if I go to Ohio or if I go to
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   another place
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   sorry not Ohio
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   Idaho. I don't know
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   if Ohio's a place you want to go
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   either.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   [laughter]
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   But what if
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   what if it's no different over
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   there?
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   What if they say well maybe if I go to Europe
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   what if you go to Europe it's the same
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   thing? What if you go to Asia? What if it's the same
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   thing? There's
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   no place to escape. But here's the
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   real problem.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   Here's the real problem. The problem is not
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   with location.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   Ultimately it's not the
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   government.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   It's in us.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   So whether
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   we live in California or Texas
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   or in some remote part of the
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   world the Bible says all have sinned
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   and fall short of the glory of
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   God. And so wherever
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   we go whatever we do we will
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   bring the curse with us.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   It says Christ wanted
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   to deliver us from this curse.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   Not only did he
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   reverse the curse he said he became
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   the curse for us. And he
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   on the cross absorbed that
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   curse that mankind was under and
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   he absorbed the curse upon himself
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   and in the resurrection of
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   Christ he brought blessing.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   But just as there was a
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   condition for
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   God's blessing and a warning
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   for God's curse
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   the scripture makes it very clear.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   The condition for the reversal
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   of this curse is that if you
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   confess your sins
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   if we acknowledge that this is where we're
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   at. That I
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   recognize that I have cancer
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   and that I am
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   in need. Oh what a wretched man that I am.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   Who will save me
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   from this curse?
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   Thanks be to God.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   It says in
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   Hebrews chapter 13, 11, 13. I'm not going to
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   read the text but basically it says that
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   Christ took our curse
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   outside the camp.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   Where he was crucified.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   Any Jew would
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   have understood the symbolism
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   of what it meant for Jesus
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   to be crucified outside the camp. Because
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   to the Jews to be outside
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   of the camp basically meant that you
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   were judged by God.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   If you had leprosy
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   or if you had some egregious sin
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   your punishment was
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   outside the camp. And if it was
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   if it was capital punishment
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   they would never do it inside because they thought
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   capital punishment inside would defile
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   the land. So they didn't want to defile the land
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   so they would take the criminal or
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   whoever was the perpetrator and
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   take him outside the camp saying you are judged
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   you are under God's curse.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   Hebrews chapter 13, 11, 13
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   tells us Jesus Christ was crucified
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   outside the camp.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   To bring
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   upon the curse upon himself
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   in order to reverse
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   this curse. Outside the camp meant that you were
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   cursed by God. But Jesus
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   invites us to himself
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   to reverse this curse into a
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   blessing. Outside the
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   camp meant that you were rejected by society
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   but going to Christ
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   outside the camp meant that means now
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   that we are adopted
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   as his children. Going outside
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   the camp meant that you were considered unsalvageable
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   but Jesus invites
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   us outside the camp so that he
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   may redeem us
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   for his glory.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   Going outside the camp basically
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   was a death sentence.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   But Jesus who absorbed our
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   curse now says come outside
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   the camp that you may have life
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   and have this life abundantly.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   Psalm 30, 10-12
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   it says hear O Lord and be gracious to me
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   O Lord be my helper.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   You have turned for me my
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   mourning into dancing. You have loosed
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   my sackcloth and girded me with gladness
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   that my soul may sing praise to you
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   and not be silent. O Lord my God
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   I will give thanks to you
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   forever.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   Let me
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   conclude with this.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   Some of you have been going to church
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   all your life and you've gotten
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   bored with your faith.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   That initial
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   excitement of knowing Christ and singing
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   and serving and sharing the gospel
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   that's of the past.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   And somehow you have resolved that that's
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   something that you do when you're a kid.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   When you're young.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   But it is inevitable
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   that as you get older
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   and you get more experience in life
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   that you become a realist.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   And so you have forsaken
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   your first love long time ago.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   You have forgotten
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   what you have in Christ.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   So you celebrate
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   the resurrection because it's another
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   holiday.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   We read through scripture you put up with this
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   and then you come to church and do your part.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   But your heart has been hardened toward God
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   for many years.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   The reason why we take our time
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   to celebrate and remember
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   this whole week
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   is so that we may worship God in spirit
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   and in truth.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   To realize
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   what it is that you have been saved from.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   That that
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   curse that was upon
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   you, upon your family, everything that you've
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   touched.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   That he absorbed my curse,
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   your curse, the world's curse
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   upon himself.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   I will never understand that
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   love.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   I will never be able to explain to you.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   I can tell you what he did
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   but I can never explain why.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   It's just, it will remain a mystery.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   I don't know if I'm going to understand when I get to heaven.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   Why?
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   Why did he do that?
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   What was it
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   about me? What was it about you?
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   I don't know.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   I pray
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   that as we celebrate this resurrection Sunday
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   that the resurrection
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   would have an
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   impact in your life.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   That you would worship God
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   and live your life
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   as if you really
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   believed.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   As you really believed.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   As you confessed to do.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   Live reasonably
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   as a person who confesses
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   and celebrates this every single Sunday.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   Those of you
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   who have been brought out here with friends
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   because they wanted you
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   to hear this message and maybe
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   you've heard it before.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   Maybe there's some parts of it that don't make full sense
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   to you.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   I want
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   to pose this to you.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   Does life make sense?
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   We came from nothing.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   And we're just going to go to nothing.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   But that whole time we're here.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   We're going to study.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   We're going to make things. We're going to invent.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   And we're going to experience joy. And then we just disappear.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   Like magic. We appeared like magic.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   We're going to disappear like magic.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   Right?
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   Does it make sense to you?
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   Does it make sense that
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   just out of nothing.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   Nothing. Like nothing.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   Boom!
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   And we're here.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   Does that make sense to you?
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   I'll bet you
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   if you're reasonable there's something inside of you
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   that tells you that
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   something's off.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   Something's off.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   What we've been told
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   in this world
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   just does not make sense.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   And you question it
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   inwardly but you've never pursued
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   it.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   I want to
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   encourage you.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   Or I want to again pose a question.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   Have you sensed that curse?
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   Maybe you couldn't quite
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   identify where this is
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   coming from.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   But do you know how many people in this room
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   if I asked them
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   what their childhood was like
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   would immediately
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   tell you that there
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   was some kind of curse in our
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   family?
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   Most people
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   have sensed that curse.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   They just don't know how to describe it.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   Well the Bible tells us.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   The Bible tells
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   us that he came to deliver us from this
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   curse.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   And the only way to reverse this curse
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   is for the
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   Son of God
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   to take the curse upon himself.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   If you confess
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   your sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   you of all your unrighteousness
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   so that you and I will be
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   clothed with his righteousness.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   At the minimum
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   I pray that you wouldn't
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   you wouldn't just simply dismiss.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   You wouldn't just leave
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   this room thinking
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   you know yeah I'm at church and this guy is telling
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   me all these things and it doesn't make sense.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   At the minimum I encourage
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   you. Did the
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   resurrection happen?
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   We have books.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   After we finish if you go out to
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   the cafe to the left there is a table
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   that has books and people there that can answer
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   some of your questions. At the minimum
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   at the minimum
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   seek, ask, knock.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   And at the end conclusion
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   of that you may come out and say you know
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   this doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   But don't dismiss it
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   simply out of prejudice.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   Don't dismiss it simply because you
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   heard things from other people.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   I
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   my personal confession
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   with all my heart
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   this is
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   not a made up story.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   This is not a made up story.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   Everything made so
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   much more sense after I met Christ.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   I had so much bitterness and
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   anger in my heart.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   I was doing so many crazy
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   things and my friends and people were asking me
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   Peter if you keep doing that don't you know you're going to go to
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   prison? Don't you know you're going to die?
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   And my answer to them was I don't
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   care.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   I don't care. That was not a
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   deterrent to me. If I die
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   pain stops.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   All of a sudden I meet Christ
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   my eyes are open I realize God is real.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   And the moment
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   that I met him the curse
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   was reversed.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   Every pain that I had
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   every bitterness every bitter memory that
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   I had of my childhood all of a sudden
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   I realized
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   he did it
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   to bring me here.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   People ask me Peter when did
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   you decide to be a pastor? I never decided to be
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   a pastor.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   But once I met Christ all I wanted to do was
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   tell as many people as possible
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   that God is
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   real.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   He was really crucified
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   and he was really resurrected
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   so that you and I
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   may have life and have this life
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   abundantly.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   Please don't stiff arm this
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   God. They just
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   nibble at Christ.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   You just say I believe
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   and you stay your distance so that you can have
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   both. You're not having both.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   Either you come to Christ or you
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   reject Christ. There's nothing in the middle.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   So my prayer
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   my hope is that
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   whether you're confessing Christian or whether
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   you are up to this point
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   confess to be unbeliever
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   that you would come to Christ
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   and know this
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   reversal of this curse and to be
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   blessed under
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   this loving God. Let's pray.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   Father
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   I pray that the power of the
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   cross
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   which may seem foolish to the world
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   would demonstrate
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   its power
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   that the preaching of the cross
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   Lord God, the hearing of the cross
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   would open our eyes to see its glory
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   that even if everything
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   doesn't make sense I pray
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   that the spirit that you have
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   given us would
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   open our eyes to see the glory of the
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   gospel of Jesus Christ. That we
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   may come to know and understand
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   the depth, the width,
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   the height, and the length of the love of Christ.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   That we too
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   may surrender our lives
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   and have this curse reversed.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   May Christ
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   joy, love,
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   and hope
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   rest upon every soul
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   that comes and confesses their sins
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   and receive forgiveness for the sake of your glory.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
