[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12, we're going to be jumping back
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.240]   into the text in verse 25 through 29.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.920]   Okay, Hebrews chapter 12, verses 25 through 29.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.260]   I didn't get far in the first service, so I'm assuming I won't get far in the second
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.260]   service either.
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.980]   Okay, Hebrews chapter 12, verse 25 through 29.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.940]   Reading out of the NSV.
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:40.500]   See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking.
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.220]   For if those who did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.300]   less will we escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven.
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.540]   And his voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised saying, yet once more I will
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.560]   shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.100]   This expression yet once more denotes the removing of the things which can be shaken
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.340]   as of created things so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.500]   Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude by
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.480]   which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and all for our God is a consuming
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.480]   fire.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.360]   Let's pray.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.440]   Heavenly Father, I pray that you would protect this pulpit.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:45.900]   Whether I stand here or anyone else, may it be your words and your words only protect
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.260]   us, Lord God, from man's opinions and thoughts.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:59.440]   That we may hear your voice and only your voice, that we would not refuse you.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.560]   May the authority that you've given to the church, that you've placed in your word by
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.640]   the Holy Spirit, be known, Lord God, to everyone who has drawn near to this room to hear from
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640]   you.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.440]   Anoint this time, Father God, that your grace would be enough.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:27.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.760]   One of the most powerful words that we have in English is the word grace.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.360]   Grace is the reason why you and I are here.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.280]   We're saved by the grace of God.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.920]   We endure because of this grace.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.040]   Grace is what gives hope to the hopeless.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.760]   When there seems to be no human answer of what's going on in our life, what's going
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.080]   on in the world, and yet grace gives us hope.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:10.120]   It gives hope and refuge to those who are helpless and oppressed.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.780]   What's going on in Afghanistan where brothers and sisters are suffering from human eyes,
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.840]   it is terrifying.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.200]   From human perspective, there is no hope.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.800]   When Apostle Paul, in his suffering, begged Christ to remove the thorn on his side, Jesus'
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.920]   answer to him was, "My grace is sufficient for you."
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.880]   It is sufficient for Paul, it is sufficient for us, and our brothers and sisters who are
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.600]   in Afghanistan who is praying to God, the ultimate answer is, "However this turns out
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.440]   that his grace is sufficient."
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.240]   It is a powerful word.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.360]   We sing about his grace, we memorize scriptures about his grace.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.480]   It gives us comfort, it gives us hope, it gives us reasons to sing.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:12.160]   But when grace is misunderstood and it is misapplied or it is cheapened, it has dire
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.800]   consequences.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:24.680]   We make grace a free ticket to enter into heaven, that we can continue to live in darkness
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.760]   and sin, and we declare the grace of God to be covered.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.960]   It's kind of like when we were children, you know, we played games and we would lie
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.680]   to our siblings or to our friends and we cross our fingers, you know, behind our back and
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.280]   we can tell all kinds of lies.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.800]   And you say, "You lied."
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.840]   It's like, "No, I'm okay because I crossed my finger."
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:55.520]   When grace is misapplied and it is cheap, it perverts righteousness, where it gives
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.760]   us a reason to live in sin and selfishness and rebellion against God and declare that
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.520]   it's because of grace I'm safe.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.240]   Grace can be easily perverted if we're not careful, not realizing what we believe and
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.680]   practice is cheap grace.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.640]   Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes in his book, Discipleship, about this cheap grace, and this is what he
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.640]   says.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.720]   "Cheap grace is a deadly enemy of our church.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.960]   We are fighting today for costly grace.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.600]   Cheap grace means grace sold on the market like a cheap jack's wear."
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.320]   In other words, he just passes it out like it's not worth much.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.600]   "The sacraments, the forgiveness of sin, the consolations of religion are thrown away
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.000]   at cut prices.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.600]   Grace is represented at the church's inexhaustible treasury from which she showers blessing with
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.200]   generous hands without asking questions or fixing limits.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.040]   Grace without price, grace without cost.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.560]   The essence of grace, we suppose, is that the account has been paid in advance, and
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   because it has been paid, everything can be had for nothing."
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.520]   That's the definition of cheap grace.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:21.080]   I remember years ago, I was out in Kenya visiting an orphan work that our church members were
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.320]   involved in, and I found something very surprising about the economy over there.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.840]   Because they've had poor government, and they have so many resources over there, but
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.280]   it's clearly it's been poor for many, many generations.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:46.320]   Because of civil war, famine, AIDS epidemic, the economy has been crushed for many generations.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.920]   And what I noticed was there were a lot of Christian signs everywhere, and I realized
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.600]   that their economy was being propped up by outside help.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.280]   So everywhere you go, you'll see buses, cars, buildings that have been dedicated in
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.920]   the name of Christ.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.120]   Some Baptist something, some Presbyterian something, some Pentecostal something, but
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.920]   you'll see those crosses and signs everywhere.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.760]   And I realized that they've been getting a lot of aid for many, many generations.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.920]   And where this was most evident was, those of you guys who know, who's ever traveled
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.080]   with me, I usually travel with some beef jerky.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.160]   And the reason why is I'm not very adventurous with food.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.040]   I usually, like if I like something and I go to that restaurant, I order the same thing
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.560]   100% of the time, right?
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.760]   Until somebody, it looks good and I'll taste it next time I order that, but I'm not adventurous
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.360]   with food.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.440]   So it was no different.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.640]   I was in Kenya and I took a couple bags of beef jerky and I was eating it, and one of
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.560]   the pastors saw it and I offered it to him.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.920]   He ate it and he loved it.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.600]   And then the next thing that came out of his mouth was, "Do you have any more?"
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.600]   So of course, I'll give him some more.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.360]   He ate that and he ate it up.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.560]   And then the next thing that he said to me surprised me and he said, "Give me the bag."
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.560]   Just like that.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.420]   "Give me the bag."
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.800]   So I was like, "Maybe his English isn't good."
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.840]   You know, that's pretty rude the way he asked for it.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.240]   So I said, "Okay, I'm here trying to help them.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.320]   He's doing work with orphans."
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.840]   So I gave him the bag and then he ate it and said, "Do you have any more?
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.720]   You didn't even finish that."
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.120]   Of course, I brought some more because I was there for a while.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.120]   He asked me, "How have some?"
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.440]   I said, "Give it to me."
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440]   Just like that.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.440]   He said, "Give it to me."
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.440]   So I said, "What is going on here?
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.860]   Did I do something to offend this guy?"
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.280]   So I ended up giving him the beef jerky and I was just kind of like perplexed the way
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.920]   he asked for it.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.880]   And then the next thing that came out of his mouth is because he said, "You are rich and
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.220]   we are poor.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.020]   You have plenty at home and I do not.
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.020]   So give it to me."
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.320]   So I realized that from that encounter is that at least that pastor was so used to getting
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.880]   things from the outsiders.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.160]   It was just a matter of fact.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.160]   Give it to me.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.800]   There was no thank you, no appreciation.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   You're supposed to.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   You're a Christian.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   I'm a Christian.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   God gave you plenty.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   I don't have enough.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   So give it to me.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.480]   I remember experiencing that also when I was doing homeless ministry and I would go out
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.240]   and we would feed every week on Tuesday and then we'd gather all these extra clothing
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.400]   because it was wintertime and then we would set up and we would always have a hard time
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.800]   keeping in line because they would rush to the front and just grab whatever they want.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.000]   And so those people who weren't at the front and didn't get the clothes that they wanted
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.360]   and it would start out with thank you but it would always end with somebody cussing
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.720]   me out because I didn't bring enough or the sizes don't fit or it wasn't exactly what
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.960]   they wanted.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:51.220]   And I would always leave after giving that to them saying like, "What is this?"
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:56.480]   And so for a period I was like, "Man, they're not worth this.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.720]   I'm sacrificing to do all of this and I get cussed out."
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.320]   And again, it's not everybody that did that but there would always be somebody who don't
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.460]   realize what it is and then they would just leave.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:16.020]   As extreme as those examples may sound, that's what cheap grace looks like.
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.540]   When we come into church and we demand grace from each other, you're Christians, you're
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.380]   church, why are you acting that way?
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.620]   Shouldn't you be more gracious?
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.700]   You cannot by definition demand grace.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:33.700]   Grace is asking for something that you don't deserve so how can you demand grace?
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.560]   If you demand grace, you don't understand what grace is.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.260]   That is cheap grace that we're expecting.
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.100]   We don't expect grace.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.380]   We should expect justice.
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:53.680]   I mean if we're to be honest, what we really expect is vengeance if you wrong somebody.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:59.060]   But if we are somewhat righteous and have some conscience that we would only seek justice
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:07.540]   but to demand grace, to demand grace, to come into church and say, "Why didn't God answer
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.540]   my prayer?"
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:15.500]   Why do you think that God has to answer your prayers?
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.500]   Where was God?
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:22.300]   Why do you automatically think that God is supposed to answer your prayers?
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:29.060]   What is it about grace that you think and you have a knee-jerk reaction, a default setting
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.340]   of God needs to run when I call?
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:39.060]   All of that is because cheap grace has deeply penetrated our psyche especially because of
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.180]   where you and I live.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.500]   The love of God has been passed out like free candy on Halloween.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.540]   And so we've been trained to believe.
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:54.060]   Even though we would never express it, we've been trained to believe and feel that God
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.420]   needs to come when I call.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.860]   That is cheap grace.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:05.800]   You know even the word charisma, the English word charisma, when we say somebody has charisma,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.580]   we automatically think this is somebody who's gregarious, who's good with people, who's
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.080]   not awkward, somebody who's able to keep a crowd and make people feel good.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:20.360]   The very definition of the word charisma in its word has the word grace, the Greek word
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.000]   charis.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.640]   So if you look at the etymology of this word, it basically comes from Middle English and
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.400]   it basically means the one who has been favored.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.280]   Where God has been gracious to him.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.480]   That's a definition of the word charisma.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.840]   But the way you and I use it is he has charisma.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.920]   The actual word means he's been given grace.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.120]   That's what that word means.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:56.320]   And just as we have perverted that word to think that somebody innately has charisma,
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:05.460]   cheap grace doesn't recognize who it is that we are dealing with.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:10.520]   We must not make the mistake that God's grace means that we are free to do whatever we want.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.720]   Cross our fingers, right?
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:20.480]   We raised our hand, we got baptized, so I feel bad when I sin, but once saved, always
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.800]   saved.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.600]   Grace must not be perverted.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.080]   It is the kindness of God that leads us to what?
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.080]   Repentance.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:41.120]   And those of you who were at the retreat, Dr. Street did a great job of what is true
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.120]   repentance.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.720]   True repentance isn't simply feeling sorry.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   I felt bad that I did that.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.560]   True repentance is to turn from our sins.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:58.280]   To put away our old life, that we may reconcile and restore what ought to be.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.320]   That's true repentance.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.320]   So it's the kindness.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.360]   It's not the grace of God that simply covers you so that the penalty of sin no longer belongs
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.360]   to you.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:11.440]   But true repentance is to turn away from that and to turn to God.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:18.440]   And it is the kindness of God, it is the grace of God that leads us to true repentance.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:23.840]   It is cheap grace to think that because we raised our hand, because we went into the
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:29.800]   water, we are covered so now we can live the rest of our life any way we desire.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.280]   That is cheap grace and it is not biblical grace.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.880]   God's grace provides us the ability to choose life over death, to choose obedience over
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.000]   disobedience.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.280]   That's grace.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:51.200]   It's not you and I, by our own will, by our own effort, that we somehow are choosing to
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.240]   do what we think is right to do.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:59.080]   He said it's the grace of God, true grace of God, that causes us to turn from our sins
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.400]   and to live a new life in Christ.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.720]   The whole book of Titus is to deal with this idea of cheap grace.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.880]   People are professing with their mouth that they believe in Jesus Christ but by their
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.880]   life they deny Him.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.680]   That's what it says in Titus 1.16.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.100]   They profess to know God.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.840]   They profess to have God's grace.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:28.360]   They profess with their mouth they know God but by their deeds they deny Him.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.640]   Your works speak louder than your words.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.560]   That's what he's saying.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.720]   Your life is more evident of what you believe than what you profess.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:44.320]   Being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deeds because it's just a profession.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.040]   It's not real.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.040]   It's cheap grace.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:53.840]   Titus chapter 2, 11-14, "For the grace of God has appeared, grace of God has appeared,
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:59.440]   bringing salvation to all men, instructing us to deny ungodliness, worldly desire, and
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:04.600]   to live sensibly, righteously, and godly in the present age."
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.920]   What challenges them?
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.920]   What causes them?
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.920]   What tells them?
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.920]   What rebukes them?
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.240]   What corrects them?
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.120]   It's the grace of God, it says.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.280]   The grace of God has appeared, instructing and telling.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.640]   Looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior,
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.680]   Christ Jesus, who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.560]   The grace of God did that.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:35.200]   And to purify Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.540]   The grace of God did that.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:43.360]   We have a tendency to think that if we start to preach strong sermons and people feel guilty
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.400]   and rebuked, that's not grace.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.880]   We need to talk more about grace.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:57.400]   Grace means that despite your sins, that God covered us and we can leave encouraged
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.240]   and continue to live the way we desire to live.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.240]   That's grace.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.960]   You continue to preach grace because our life is hard enough as it is.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:10.000]   But when we are confronted over our sins and rebuked and challenged to live righteous lives,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.640]   that is not grace.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:18.640]   That is legalism, harshness, guilt, law.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:25.120]   And yet he says the grace of God, the grace of God teaches us to live and follow Christ
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.120]   righteously.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:33.000]   It is because cheap grace has so deeply embedded into our psyche.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.640]   Because the word of God and the grace of God in the gospel has been peddled.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.960]   So that we can get the gospel to the lowest common denominator and an individual who has
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:48.380]   never truly surrendered their life to Christ can also be accepted into the kingdom of God.
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.600]   Because all you have to do is give Jesus a chance.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.840]   The way that the gospel is being propagated in our generation is that God is the one who
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.160]   offended us.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.320]   And the church is apologizing to the world.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.320]   Give us a chance.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.320]   Come to church.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.320]   Accept Jesus.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.160]   And whatever it is that you've been offended by, we'll try to minimize that as much as
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.160]   possible.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:18.360]   And so people are walking through the door with cheap grace in their mind from day one.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.280]   Sinners are coming into the church with a consumer mindset.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.760]   So do I want to be at this church?
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.740]   If you want to keep me at this church, I want this.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.580]   So the sinners are the ones who have been offended.
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.200]   And the holy God is the one who has offended.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:40.700]   And the church is begging an opportunity for the sinners to give Jesus a chance.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.720]   Imagine how offensive that is.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:53.300]   If somebody offended you and you sent an ambassador on your behalf and they were begging
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.280]   for them to give you a chance.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:02.460]   If you were the one offended, see that's cheap grace.
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.360]   That's cheap grace.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:14.680]   The way that the gospel is preached has to represent the holy God that's been offended.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.520]   He's the one we need to reconcile with.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.760]   He's the one we need to appease.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.560]   He's the one we worship.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:28.120]   So when we come to church, our primary thought should not be, "What am I getting out of this?"
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.120]   It's how can I have a relationship with this holy God?
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.520]   It is because the gospel has been propagated cheaply.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.600]   It's been handed out as free candy to anyone who wants it.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:49.240]   All because men who are afraid of human opinion.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:55.000]   Men who have become convinced that a successful church is the largest church.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.520]   Men who have been convinced that if you have many people who honor you, that you must be
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.920]   doing something right.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.600]   Men who should not be speaking.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.280]   Men who should not have been ordained.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:18.520]   Men who should not have ever been speaking on behalf of an offended holy God.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:23.200]   All because of cheap grace.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.840]   There's three things that I wanted to give you an outline of the text that we're looking
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.000]   at, but like I told you, I didn't get through the first one.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   So we'll get to the others.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   We're in no hurry.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.600]   At least I'm not.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.000]   Three things.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.920]   Proper response to the grace of God.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:46.040]   God's grace demands that we pay close attention to what God has to say.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.160]   Proper response.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.160]   Take what he says seriously.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:54.240]   God's grace reminds us to live for what cannot be shaken.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:01.960]   How much of what we pursue when Christ comes will mean nothing.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.040]   God's grace calls us to worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.880]   Those are the all three things that we see in this text.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.600]   How to respond properly.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.360]   First one.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.760]   God's grace demands that we pay close attention to what God says.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.760]   Verse 25.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.360]   "See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking."
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:28.000]   Remember, the previous text, just to remind you, just four weeks ago we were talking about
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.480]   this, and he was differentiating between coming to Mount Sinai and Mount Zion.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:38.440]   Mount Sinai represented terror, where the people of Israel was begging Moses, "Tell
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.480]   God to stop speaking to us," because they were so terrified.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:46.080]   Even a glimpse of his glory terrified them and asked Moses to go inside the tent because
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.560]   they couldn't look at him.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.520]   But he says, "You did not come to Mount Sinai.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:56.400]   You came to Mount Zion, a place of joy, of worship, where the angels and all the multitudes
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.440]   will be gathered together to worship him, to experience his true life."
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:06.600]   So after explaining this grace, after reminding them, "You didn't come to Mount Sinai.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.240]   You came to Zion, a place of celebration and banquet."
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:17.760]   But in conclusion to that, you would think, you say, "Well, because God is gracious.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.800]   Because God is gracious."
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:27.680]   We would typically think if you only understood cheap grace, "Because God is gracious, I can
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.680]   do whatever I want.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.400]   My salvation is secure.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.500]   Because God is gracious, no matter how much I sin, God will never forsake me.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.280]   Because God is gracious."
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.200]   And so that's what naturally we would think.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:47.920]   But he says, "Because God has been gracious," he says, "do not refuse him who speaks."
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.280]   Because God is gracious.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.480]   Pay close attention to what he has to say.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:58.700]   That was the practical application of telling us about his grace.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.520]   Take what he says seriously.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.640]   Now you have to understand, like when he says, "Do not refuse him," what does it mean to
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.840]   refuse him?
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:12.800]   And according to the context of the book of Hebrews, the whole time he's been telling
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.900]   them to do what?
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.240]   Not to neglect.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.080]   Neglect.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.240]   What do you have to do to not to neglect?
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.280]   Because clearly that's what he means here by, "Do not refuse him."
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.080]   What does he mean by not to neglect?
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:34.320]   What do you have to do not to neglect?
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.520]   Absolutely nothing.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:43.040]   How will you escape if you neglect such a great salvation?
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   We're warned over and over again, "Do not drift."
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.440]   What do you have to do to drift?
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:54.280]   How hard do you have to work to drift?
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.480]   Nothing.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:05.400]   So when he says here, "Do not refuse him," refusing him requires no effort on our part.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.680]   Continue to do what comes natural to you.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.040]   Continue to live you as the center of your life.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.620]   Continue.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.620]   Just continue.
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.620]   You need to do nothing.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:23.120]   If you want to hear the warning from God, if you want to refuse him, do nothing.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:28.840]   After the warning that has been given to you, if you want to refuse him, do nothing.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.360]   There's nothing to do.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.640]   Just go outside, live your life the way you've always been living, and just continue to pursue,
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.120]   and just make sure that you're back here on Sunday.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.440]   That's all you need to do to refuse him.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:46.320]   When God speaks, He doesn't come and speak and say, "You know what?
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.760]   I just want to tell you I love you," and then He disappears.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.000]   There's a reason why God speaks.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.040]   When God interjects into human history to speak directly to His prophets, to speak to
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:05.460]   His children, it's because there is danger.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.060]   He comes to instruct them, gives them warnings so that we can change.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:13.880]   He speaks in order that sinful men and women would repent.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.640]   He's not speaking empty words.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.480]   That's exactly what He says.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:22.320]   In Deuteronomy 32, 45-47, when He spoke to the nation of Israel and gave them all the
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:27.160]   instructions of His law, He summarizes by saying this, "When Moses had finished speaking
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.780]   all these words to Israel, He said to them, 'Take to your heart all the words with which
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.960]   I am warning you today.'"
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:38.640]   Remember, at the retreat, Dr. Shreve said the heart is not just talking about emotion,
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.520]   but it's our very being.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:47.040]   And when He says, "Take to heart," He's talking about deep in your soul, not just how you
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.720]   feel.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.360]   When you've heard the Word of God, "Take to heart all the words with which I am warning
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.480]   you today, which you shall command your sons to observe carefully."
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.480]   Command.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.880]   And when He says sons, He's not just talking about children.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.680]   He's talking about the nation of Israel.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.360]   Don't suggest it to them.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.800]   Don't suggest it to them and say, "Hey, I'm going to give you some good advice."
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.840]   He says, "Command them."
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.840]   How can He command?
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:13.840]   Who is Moses to command them?
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.320]   Moses is just another man like anybody else.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.120]   He is fraught with weakness like anybody else.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.640]   He is fearful like anybody else.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.160]   How can Moses command them?
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:31.400]   He tells them to command them because He speaks on behalf of God who tells Him to.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.160]   Command them.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.840]   Why does He give this command?
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.160]   Command your sons to observe carefully, even all the words of the law, for it is not an
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.640]   idle word for you.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.160]   It is not something for you to hear and then make your decision, "Ah, let me think about
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.160]   it.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.160]   Maybe I'll do it later.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.160]   Maybe at the right time."
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.880]   It is not idle words for you.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.040]   Indeed, it is your life, life and death.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:58.800]   When God speaks and He says, "Move," and you don't move, there's deathly consequence.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:04.440]   When God says to do this and you say, "Ah, maybe not now."
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.940]   And by this word, you will prolong your days in the land which you are about to cross the
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.440]   Jordan to possess.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.720]   Even chapter 12, 25b, which we just read, why do we need to pay close attention?
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:23.160]   For if those did not escape when they refused Him who warned them on earth, much less will
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:28.760]   we escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.560]   Think about what Mount Sinai was.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:36.200]   Mount Sinai was not the demonstration of His full glory.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:41.520]   Mount Sinai was a glimpse of His glory.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.960]   That glimpse of His glory that He touched down on earth at Mount Sinai was so terrifying
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.760]   that sinners not only did not want to look at Him, they didn't want to hear from Him.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:28:00.120]   His very words were terrifying and they begged Him, "Please tell them to stop speaking."
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.280]   Because they were so terrified.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.720]   Didn't He say we didn't go to Mount Sinai?
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.480]   Didn't He say we're Zion now?
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.520]   I thought we weren't supposed to be terrified because we've been covered by the blood of
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.520]   Christ.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.840]   So who is He speaking to?
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:25.960]   He is speaking to people who have embraced cheap grace.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:31.840]   And they may be in danger of feeling falsely secure because of this cheap grace.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.140]   And because of this cheap grace, they think they can approach the throne of God.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.140]   They couldn't approach Sinai from a distance.
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.640]   But a sinner who's not been washed by the blood of Christ, who doesn't understand true
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:49.800]   grace walking into His presence with confidence in false grace.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:56.440]   How much more would it be terrifying if God who spoke at Sinai caused this kind of fear?
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:04.520]   How much more a professing Christian who has been deceived when he meets the Holy God from
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.640]   heaven.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.520]   That's what He's referring to.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.080]   People who have been deceived by cheap grace.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:18.740]   Hebrews chapter 2, 1-3 it says, "For this reason, we must pay much closer attention
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:24.920]   to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.880]   If the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and every transgression and disobedience received
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:36.000]   a just penalty, how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?"
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.040]   You hear it and you just pick and choose what you want.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.240]   You know, I love the fact that Jesus loves me unconditionally.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.080]   I love the fact that my sins have been covered.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.600]   I love the fact that we have eternity in Christ.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.520]   And we're going to have eternity with Him.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.160]   Pick up your cross, deny yourself.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.760]   You want to live?
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.680]   To forsake your life to follow Christ?
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.160]   That's for the pastors, the missionaries, the serious Christians, the gung-ho, the Jesus
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.160]   freaks.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:07.880]   But for regular Christians, I choose cheap grace.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.680]   Cheap grace isn't grace at all.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.000]   In fact, it isn't even salvation.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.120]   It is the greatest deception.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:24.320]   It is the greatest tool that Satan uses to deceive thousands, hundreds of thousands,
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:34.560]   and millions of people in the church to continue to walk as themselves at the center, pursuing
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:42.280]   their life, their comfort, their luxury in the name of Jesus.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:47.100]   But their life has never been surrendered to Christ.
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:55.780]   And it's hard to distinguish because people who embrace cheap grace are in the church.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.160]   They serve the church.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.680]   Sometimes they lead Bible studies.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.360]   They know a lot about Scripture.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.600]   They know how to play this game.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:16.280]   But you and I know, you and I know if we have been surrendered or not, if we're pursuing
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:21.640]   our own life in the name of Jesus or we've actually surrendered our life.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:27.720]   When we get baptized, part of the reason why we don't sprinkle is because the meaning of
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:31.240]   baptism is burial.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.020]   That's what it says in the book of Romans.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.320]   We are buried with Christ.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.320]   That's why when somebody gets baptized, we ask them, "Do you understand that you're being
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.640]   buried with Christ?"
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:44.720]   And that's why when somebody gets baptized, if they don't put their whole body in, I shove
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.680]   it in further.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.360]   Some people go in and they don't want to get their hair wet.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.960]   No, your hair needs to die too.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.100]   So we shove them in.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.480]   Some people have nice makeup on.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.720]   They go right up to here.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.880]   And then I said, "No, you got to go all the way in."
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.480]   We can't bury you with your face sticking up.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:16.800]   But the idea of burial is to die with Christ.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.200]   As He was buried, we are to be buried.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.200]   That's what baptism is.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.120]   We are united with His death.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:29.400]   Not just sacrifice, not hard life, with His death.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:34.100]   And whatever life that we were holding on to prior to is gone.
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.360]   That's how the Bible describes it.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.320]   Behold, the old has gone.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   The new has come.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.720]   So that's why we ask, "Do you understand you're going into the water buried with Christ?"
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:50.080]   When you come out, you're united with Christ's resurrected life.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:33:08.800]   People who practice cheap grace have united with Him in certain parts.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:13.040]   But they're not dead.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.800]   Our life doesn't look much different than the rest of the world.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.200]   We pursue the same things that the world pursues.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.560]   We just go to church on Sunday.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.080]   We're worried about the same thing that they're worried about.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.000]   We're just active on Sunday.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.200]   We're just as concerned, just as worried, just as fearful as the rest of the world,
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:40.840]   except I'm active at church on Sunday or weekday.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:47.600]   True grace causes us to recognize that He saved us from this.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:55.020]   The very things that you and I are pursuing is what caused this death.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:34:02.280]   The reason why there's marriage problems is because we're not dead yet.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.760]   There's relational issues because we're not dead yet.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.560]   Dead people don't argue.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.680]   Dead people don't have fights.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.320]   Dead people don't divide.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:20.400]   So our challenge in sanctification is to die, not to become better.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.400]   No, to die.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:28.840]   You can't think about becoming better until you're dead, until the old has gone.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:34.080]   But if you've never got rid of the old and you're trying to build on top of something
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.160]   that haven't died, that's why the frustration is coming.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:43.480]   Because the ground keeps shifting.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:48.720]   Hebrews chapter 10, 26 to 31, it says, "If we go on sinning willfully after receiving
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:53.880]   the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins."
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.680]   This is talking to the church.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.520]   But a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will consume the
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.520]   adversaries.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.320]   "Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.560]   or three witnesses.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.640]   How much severe punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled underfoot the
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:16.080]   Son of God, has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he has been sanctified?"
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   He was sanctified.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.000]   "And has insulted the Spirit of grace.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   For we know him who said, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay.'"
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   And again, the Lord will judge his people.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.800]   It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.280]   He says, once you've received the knowledge and you continue to willfully sin, the judgment
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.080]   is much greater.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.760]   Wait a second, I thought we were saved by grace.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.160]   He's talking to people who never really received true grace.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.160]   Cheap grace.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:50.600]   In fact, all the knowledge you get causes you to have greater judgment.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:55.120]   Sitting in a church that reveals the Word of God to you week after week after week,
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:00.960]   and then there continue to live after your own desires, you're heaping up greater judgment
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.880]   for yourself.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.880]   Let me give you an example.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:11.480]   Let's say you bought a nice house, brand new paint, and you have children aged 17,
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.480]   10, and 3.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:19.000]   You go to work, you come back one day and you see black marker just everywhere.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.760]   Would it make a difference, the kind of punishment that you carry out, if it was a 3-year-old,
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.100]   a 10-year-old, or a 17-year-old?
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.120]   If it is a 3-year-old, you would say, he still needs to be punished because he needs to learn,
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.560]   he needs to be corrected, because he just doesn't know any better.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.000]   If a 10-year-old did it, you're 10 years old, you should have known, we've been training
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.120]   you.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.120]   What happened to you?
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.120]   Why did you do this?
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.060]   And you're curious to find out what is his motive.
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:53.880]   If a 17-year-old did it, you may assume he's trying to make a statement.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.240]   He knows what he's done.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.480]   You're 17 years old.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.460]   He must be angry with me.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.280]   He must be doing something.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.560]   But if you say, no, I would carry out the same punishment whether they are 3 or whether
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:18.440]   they are 10, whether they are 17, we're going to have a parenting seminar, right?
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:23.520]   You would not, based upon their knowledge.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:29.680]   So he says to the church, you've heard the gospel.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:36.000]   You had every opportunity, the examples, every opportunity to come to Christ, every opportunity
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.760]   to surrender your life, every opportunity to come to Christ and embrace the true grace
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:45.720]   that is taught in the Word of God, and you continue to live your life outside of the
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:50.480]   grace of God with your fingers crossed.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:55.320]   I hope all of the scriptures aren't true.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.320]   I hope those parts where we're saved unconditionally, I hope those things are true.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.320]   I've raised all my life, but when the Bible says like this passage in Hebrews 10 and Hebrews
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:08.520]   2 and Hebrews 12, I hope those parts were not meant for us.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.520]   You know what's interesting?
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:15.000]   I had a conversation with somebody, and we opened up this text to them, Hebrews chapter
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.040]   6, other parts of 1 John, and you know what he said to me?
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.400]   That's not for us.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.980]   That was written for the Jews.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.600]   So therefore it doesn't apply to me.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.520]   So I'm going to continue to do what I want.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.720]   Cheap grace is what he chose to embrace.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:40.200]   Whatever passages that didn't fit that, it wasn't for him.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:46.320]   There are many people who live that way without ever expressing that, hoping that one day
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:52.760]   when they meet Christ that all of this was not for us.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:57.480]   That's why he says, "Do not refuse him."
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.800]   These are my words.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.600]   You can easily nullify me and say, "Well, you know, Pastor Peter, he has a certain kind
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.600]   of personality.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.760]   Everything's so black and white."
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.760]   That's him.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.760]   Yes, you're right.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.640]   I have a certain kind of personality.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:12.960]   It's all or nothing.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.240]   You're right about that.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.240]   He's weak.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.240]   I've seen him.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.240]   He's so careless with his words.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.720]   You're absolutely right.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:30.400]   I try so hard to work on that and it's a thorn on my side, you know, and you're right.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.400]   I've seen him.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.400]   He's not perfect.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.720]   He doesn't practice everything he preaches.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.280]   You're absolutely right.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:40.120]   I want to, but I'm wrestling and struggling and I want to be sanctified in all of those
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.120]   areas.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.680]   So you can easily nullify me.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:49.440]   What are you going to do with the Word?
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:54.480]   What are you going to do with this passage?
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.760]   How are you going to nullify this?
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.280]   Do not refuse him when you hear him.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:06.800]   If there were consequences from what he warned in Sinai, how much more the God who is fully
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:12.620]   revealed in his permanent home speaks from heaven?
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.680]   That's why it says in the book of James, "Not many of you should become teachers because
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:23.320]   they will incur upon them a stricter judgment because they know better."
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.180]   First Thessalonians 2.13.
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.180]   Remember that?
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:30.800]   When we were studying through that, the Thessalonians were known to be the model church in all of
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   Macedonia.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:36.380]   And remember, Paul didn't spend a lot of time in Thessalonica.
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.400]   He was only there for three Sundays.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:42.840]   So possibly he was there a month and he got chased out because the persecution was so
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:48.380]   intense and you have to remember, Apostle Paul was not afraid to die.
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.880]   He was ready to die.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:54.900]   Remember, when he was in Lystra, he got stoned, dragged out.
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:58.280]   He got up, went back in and preached the gospel.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.280]   This is not a man of fear.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.360]   He didn't run because he was afraid.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:05.340]   They were going after the house church members.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.400]   He left to preserve them.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:11.400]   And so after he left, he was concerned, so he sent a letter.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.600]   That's First Thessalonians, to check up on them because he left abruptly.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.400]   He didn't finish his work.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:22.980]   But all of a sudden, they come back with a report that their faith is growing, abounding.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:27.040]   Not only are they growing, they become the model church where people were talking about
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.720]   the Thessalonians.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.760]   They were loving each other, sacrificing in the midst of persecution.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.320]   It wasn't because of years of discipleship.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.720]   It wasn't because of years of human effort.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.960]   He just preached the gospel.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:46.200]   And then he describes why, why and how they became the model church, even though his human
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.200]   work was not finished.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.200]   And this is what he said, First Thessalonians 2.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.740]   13, "For this reason, we also constantly thank God that when you received the word
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:58.280]   of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but for what it
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:02.240]   really is, the word of God."
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.600]   That was the key.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.440]   They heard God's word and they took this seriously.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.800]   That it's not just men, it's not just people who are talking.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   God is speaking to us through this man.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:20.720]   And as a result of that, it says, "which also performs its work in you who believe."
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.960]   Because they took the word of God seriously.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.960]   When Paul and his companions were speaking, they didn't just hear it as a bunch of philosophers
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.960]   coming into town.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.880]   They said, they recognized God has sent these people.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.440]   God is speaking to me.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:39.240]   So when the word of God was open to them, they received it and believed, which caused
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:48.320]   them to love deeply, to even to forsake their own life.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:55.120]   You know why we have such struggles?
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:59.720]   Because the word of God does not have the same kind of authority that it had on them.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.640]   The word of God is open and we say, wow, there's so many opinions.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.680]   You say that, but they say this and they say that.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.880]   We use that as an excuse, oh, God is unknowable.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.640]   The word of God is unknowable.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.360]   So if there's so many opinions, what's the point?
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.140]   I've heard people say so much of that.
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:22.300]   So therefore, we can never be confident about anything.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.640]   You know who say that?
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.640]   People who don't study the Bible.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.800]   That's been my experience.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.560]   You can find somebody, but people don't study the Bible.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.920]   Study the Bible diligently, verse by verse.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.660]   See if you come out vague.
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.240]   See if you come out saying, oh, we're so divided.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:49.120]   You'd be surprised how clear the word of God is.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.120]   You'd be surprised.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:56.040]   Yes, it's been translated from another language, but you'd be surprised.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:02.560]   God did not write the word of God that only scholars would understand.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.640]   And that's the genius of our God.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:09.500]   He wrote this Bible that even a Sunday school student can read it for himself and clearly
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.360]   understand who God is.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:17.320]   And even the deepest of scholars who has PhD in theology will come and dig all of his life
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.160]   and never exhaust what it has to say.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.720]   That's the genius of the word of God.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.960]   So when somebody says, I read all of this stuff.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:30.280]   And so because they say so many different things, how can we know anything?
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   You know what that's like?
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.320]   That's just like somebody coming into the room and say, you know what?
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.320]   I'm Michael Jordan.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.680]   But he says he's Michael Jordan.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:44.080]   That guy on television says he's Michael Jordan.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.240]   I heard another guy in Santa Ana say he's Michael Jordan.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.800]   Kobe says he's Michael Jordan.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.520]   They all have different opinions.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.920]   So the end conclusion is we can never know.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.720]   We can never know.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.840]   That would be ridiculous.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.840]   I'm 5'6".
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:09.880]   Do I have to tell the rest?
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:13.400]   Michael Jordan is 6'6".
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:17.000]   He has different skin tones.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.420]   It's not that hard.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:28.360]   But to simply dismiss the clear word of God because you hear different opinions is simply,
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:33.720]   if we're not careful, an excuse not to engage the word.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.440]   Do not refuse him.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.880]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:44.280]   First Peter chapter 2, 2 to 3, it says, "Like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:49.320]   the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation if you've tasted the kindness
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.320]   of God."
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.720]   In other words, if you've really known the grace of God, if you've tasted the kindness
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:58.440]   of God, if you've really understood, if you've really professed, if you've really embraced
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:05.600]   the true grace of God, tasted the kindness of God, like newborn babes, long for the pure
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.000]   milk of the word.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.480]   You notice here he compares like a newborn babe.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:19.960]   If you've ever seen a baby who is born into the world for the first time, it's surprising.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:20.960]   He was never taught.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.760]   You know, they don't come out and then we have, you know, we have discipleship.
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:27.880]   This is how you're going to survive, right?
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.240]   Just suck, right?
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:32.240]   We don't tell them that.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.240]   They come out sucking.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.800]   How do they know that?
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   With their mouth.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.320]   How do they know?
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:43.040]   Who told them that food is supposed to go into their mouth?
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:47.160]   They're born from the first second that they're born.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.400]   They come out wanting food.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.960]   So he says, "Compare."
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:47:00.040]   So like newborn babes that God instinctively placed in you when you were born again.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:06.720]   Instinctively, God has placed in you a longing for his word.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.920]   So you notice here he says, like newborn babes long for what?
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.560]   Pure milk.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:18.000]   Not the watered down milk, not the imitation milk, not the milk substitute, but the pure
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.360]   milk.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.160]   Pure milk.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.600]   Not the kind of milk that you want that's going to tickle your ears.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:30.280]   Not the kind of milk that's like, "Oh, I feel very encouraged where I can continue to live
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:34.280]   with me at the center, willfully denying Christ.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.640]   I'm still at the center.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.560]   I'm just active at church.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:43.200]   I'm still concerned about me, but I'm still practicing at church."
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:49.040]   You know, the idea of tithing in the Old Testament was that they were to offer up the 10% as
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.640]   a representative that all of it belonged to God.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.960]   So some people say, "You know what, New Testament, it doesn't teach tithing."
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:01.040]   You're right, because the Old Testament was trying to build the kingdom of Israel.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:05.400]   And so they gave 10% to build the temple, to build the national Israel.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:10.840]   You come to the New Testament, it says, "No, we're not in a period at the end times when
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.400]   Israel is restored.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:17.840]   God's going to fulfill his promise, but we're in a period where God is building his spiritual
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.160]   kingdom.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.080]   So it's not about the 10% anymore."
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.280]   So Chief Grace says, "Because we're not about the 10%, we're not obligated to give anything."
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.160]   In fact, read the Bible carefully.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:35.520]   In the New Covenant, we are obligated to give everything.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.800]   Everything.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:43.000]   The idea of tithing was to teach us that, so that when the New Covenant came, we can
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.300]   surrender all of it.
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:52.840]   And whatever it is that we have to be used for His kingdom, all of it, is because of
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.200]   Chief Grace.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:05.920]   They perverted the gospel, perverted the church, perverted our witness, and lost our witness
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:10.720]   in Christ, if we're not careful.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:14.100]   Do not refuse Him.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:20.980]   And like I said, all you have to do today to refuse Him is to hear the Word of God,
[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:28.600]   hear the warnings, hear the encouragement, don't do anything.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:38.320]   Go home, do a good job at work, get your raises, get married, have children, buy a good house,
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:42.920]   make good investments, save enough money so you can retire.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:50.640]   If you're good with your money, leave some behind for your children, and then die.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:56.480]   Everything I said there innately is not sinful.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:05.800]   But if that is our primary pursuit, if that is our primary goal, we have to ask ourselves,
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:09.580]   is Christ really Lord?
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.100]   Is He really Lord?
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:15.320]   Have we truly been crucified with Christ?
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:23.580]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives with me, in me.
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:30.280]   The hope that we have in Jesus Christ is because we have surrendered our life here.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:36.680]   And so when Christ returns, we will know true life when He comes.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:43.520]   But if your kingdom is here, if your pursuit is here, Jesus' second coming is going to
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.680]   disrupt your life.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:50.600]   Innately, you do not desire a second coming.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.380]   You're in the middle of escrow.
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:56.100]   You started a new business.
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:58.580]   You're putting away for retirement.
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.900]   You just bought a new house.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.900]   Your children just entered college.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:09.080]   If Jesus comes, He's going to disrupt all of that.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:15.040]   Only those who have truly surrendered their life in Christ will be eagerly waiting for
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.500]   His coming.
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:21.220]   Do not refuse Him who is speaking.
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:26.760]   These are not my words, but His.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:33.040]   Let's pray.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:39.840]   If I can ask you to take some time to not just to pray for yourself, pray for the nominal
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:49.320]   Christians in your life who are professing to believe God and yet living in cheap grace.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:57.380]   So many people, as Jesus says, who says, "Lord, Lord," will not enter the kingdom of heaven
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:00.080]   because they did not really know God.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:06.000]   They're in the church, in the hundreds, in the thousands, maybe even in the millions.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.560]   Pray for them, your brothers, your sisters, your parents.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.380]   Pray for your coworkers.
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:18.660]   Pray for the people around us that we do not embrace cheap grace, this cultural Christianity
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:24.560]   that has nothing to do with God, that we do not hold onto the grace of God simply as a
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:31.800]   security blanket, but the power of God unto salvation to those who genuinely believe.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.480]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.480]   Pray for ourselves.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   Examine ourselves.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.880]   Is it true grace that I have received?
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.860]   Is it true grace that I have professed?
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:44.480]   And then pray for those around us.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.920]   Let's take some time to pray again as our worship team leads us.
