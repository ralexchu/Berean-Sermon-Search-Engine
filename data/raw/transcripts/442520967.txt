[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   Hello everyone, welcome to our final session in the study of the book of Ephesians.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.560]   Today we're going to be concluding with a review, a final exhortation from this book.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.000]   Let's go before the Lord in prayer as we jump into the study.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.440]   Lord we want to thank you for your grace.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:34.080]   God we are so grateful that in many ways Lord you have sent your truth, you have sent your
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.040]   grace, your servant in so many different ways.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.120]   You have reached out to us so to speak and we're so grateful for that.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.240]   I pray Lord that the truth that you have for us, that these things we would take to heart
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.240]   and God that we would learn.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.600]   And Lord what's more by understanding and Father God by believing that we would truly
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.720]   be strong in faith.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.480]   What's more Father God we would be strong in every way.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.400]   Lord we just want to thank you again for the study and pray that you would help us to be
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.360]   engaged in both mind and spirit.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.320]   We thank you it's in Christ name we pray, Amen.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.480]   Okay what I'd like to do is take a moment to read for us the final concluding section.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:30.240]   Now although we could take time to dissect and analyze each section, what I would like
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.080]   to do is just review this and then also review the whole book.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.400]   So there are going to be certain elements about this section of the scripture that I
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.280]   won't cover today but I'll leave that to you for your own independent study.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.480]   We have it in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 21.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.640]   Okay so take a moment to turn there.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.680]   Ephesians chapter 6 verse 21 it says, "But that you also may know about my circumstances
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.680]   how I am doing.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.760]   Such a case the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord will make known everything
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.840]   sorry will make everything known to you.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.520]   I have sent him to you for this very purpose so that you may know about us and that he
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.600]   may comfort your hearts.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.200]   Peace be to the brethren and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.480]   Grace be with you with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an incorruptible
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480]   love."
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:32.920]   Okay as we take a look at that passage there is something that I like to highlight here
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:43.160]   that in terms of the picture of the book you can typically summarize a book by the emphasis
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.120]   or the exhortation given at the end.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.160]   Now what's interesting is as you look at this last portion of the passage there isn't necessarily
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.160]   a command.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.680]   There isn't necessarily a specific exhortation of thou must do this.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.920]   But nevertheless there is a desire of the author Apostle Paul that he wants to be in
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.880]   reality for the recipients.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.200]   And likewise anytime we write people letters and things like that what we're doing is more
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.400]   so expressing what we want for them in life.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.520]   And what he describes is that he wants them to be in the know.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.840]   He wants them to be informed.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.240]   He wants them to be comforted.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.960]   But more than anything he says peace be to the brethren and love with faith from God
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.920]   the Father the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.240]   Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an incorruptible love.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.480]   So if you summarize and think about what Apostle Paul wants for them he wants there to be peace,
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.080]   love, faith and grace and this love that is also coming from them.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.680]   So as we think about that we actually realize that has been Apostle Paul's tone and is I
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.760]   guess the content the whole time through the letter.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.120]   And the way that I'm going to review is going chapter by chapter.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.640]   And what I'll try to do is emphasize for you what I would like to boil down this review
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.020]   as to one theme that I see.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.320]   So what is the theme?
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.480]   What is the running ongoing content that has been the pattern of Apostle Paul's prayers,
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:30.200]   the content of his teaching, but also even in this last concluding address.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.600]   And the theme is strength.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.240]   Strength that's real and true.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.440]   Strength that comes from faith.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.440]   And I'll show it to you.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.440]   Starting from chapter one.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.440]   Sorry that's not working right now.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.440]   There we are.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.440]   Starting from chapter one.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.360]   He says, recall that in chapter one a significant key verse in chapter one that you should kind
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.600]   of have in your memory bank says chapter one is mostly about this which is, "Blessed be
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.120]   the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.200]   in the heavenly places."
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.400]   The idea here then in chapter one is that there has been what I like to call a bucket
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.640]   of blessing.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.440]   Apostle Paul wants to bless God and have every single one of us bless God because we have
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.720]   received, another way to say it, is a truckload of blessing.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.840]   He describes that we have in Christ every spiritual blessing.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.840]   And that's why actually when I started the study a long time ago, already a while ago,
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.960]   I started by saying that this book is all about every blessing in Jesus Christ.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.080]   Every blessing that we're seeking, every blessing we could potentially even want, it comes in
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.680]   the person of Christ.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:02.280]   Now as a challenge and as an exhortation for us thinking about this, can you fill this
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.040]   bucket?
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.400]   Can you describe what is contained in this truckload?
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:17.200]   Can you go from the broad categorical summary that you've been really, really blessed, can
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.960]   you go from there to describe the specific ways that you've been blessed?
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.720]   Another way to put this is sometimes I have seen within scripture a pattern where it gives
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.240]   you this lofty summary conclusion.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.120]   You've been lavished.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.000]   That's a conclusion.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.680]   You have been freely given.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.040]   Those are summary conclusions.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.000]   And what's more our scripture uses the word richly.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.800]   You've been richly graced.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.400]   You've been richly loved.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.760]   You've been richly cared for.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.480]   So those are all actually summary conclusions and my challenge and question to you is can
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.760]   you give an example?
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:06.160]   Because sometimes we may say large categorical summaries but if we do not have the specific
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.760]   details then all of a sudden people will call your bluff.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:16.080]   If you say you are a massive, massive fan of a specific team, let's say the LA Dodgers
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.600]   and someone asks you, "Really?
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   When did you start?"
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   "Well, you know, always."
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   "Oh yeah?
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   Who do you like?"
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.240]   "Oh, don't ask me questions because I don't really know who's on the team."
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.840]   It's kind of like the specifics matter because it goes from specifics to the conclusion otherwise
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.840]   we do it backwards.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.720]   But I just want you to recall with me because this is such a significant point and there
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:43.960]   was so much contained in the book, in the chapter one just alone, we have thoughts of
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.920]   that God has chosen us from before the foundation of the earth, that God has chosen us to be
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.680]   holy, a purposeful intent in his heart.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:00.760]   God has adopted us, God has given us redemption, he's given us forgiveness in the name of Christ
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.600]   and that forgiveness is in accordance with the riches of his grace.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.920]   He's given us the knowledge and the mystery of the gospel.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.600]   He's given us also a seal, okay?
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:17.280]   A seal, ignore that what's on the screen there, a seal of promise is what it's supposed to
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.280]   say.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.640]   Yeah, what's more we have the pledge of the Holy Spirit for our inheritance and most of
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.880]   all that first chapter was actually talking a lot about the fact that if you have Christ
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:33.720]   then you have a glorious, holy, loving, all-sufficient head.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.400]   Jesus Christ is the head of the church.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.360]   We know that we need leaders.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.600]   We know that we need provision.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.400]   We know that we need good models and examples.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.720]   The amazing thing is we have a perfect one.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.200]   For the church we have a perfect example.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.920]   For the church we have a perfect resource.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.800]   That is Christ himself and that to us is to us our great, great blessing.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:06.000]   So I want to take a moment to say chapter one it began with such, I guess you can just
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.560]   say again a truckload of gold.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.360]   Okay, so if you pick up the picture here those are gold bars.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.040]   You have gold bars of the Christian faith.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.560]   To say that you have someone who loves you so much that he desires you to be a part of
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:28.800]   his home, to adopt you, to redeem you and again there's so much to say about all those
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.160]   things.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:38.280]   But the truth of those things are to us gold meaning they're riches and if you don't understand
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:44.520]   this then that means you're going to live a life constantly thinking you're poor, constantly
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.840]   living in scarcity, feeling like you have to fight for scraps and if you've ever met
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.720]   somebody who is constantly competitive, always designed to compare, you've met somebody so
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:01.280]   insecure about their own well-being and therefore feeling the need to make sure that they're
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.840]   not taken advantage of.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.160]   It's a difficult time.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.160]   It's a difficult place.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.320]   It's a difficult way to live.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.920]   There is no peace.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.920]   And so you have to remember and know this.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.320]   Apostle Paul's great prayer and Apostle Paul's exhortation is to remember this and to know
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.440]   what glorious riches we have.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.960]   If we do not, we live life acting like we're beggars.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.920]   We live life weak.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.360]   Weak to temptation.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.080]   Weak to allurements.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.480]   Weak to people offering anything.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480]   Why?
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.800]   Because we feel like we don't have it.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.600]   So this is an incredible starting point that we study in the book of Ephesians.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.960]   Now moving to chapter 2.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:50.560]   In chapter 2 it says, verse 4 and 5, "But God being rich in mercy, because of his great
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.760]   love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our transgression, made us alive
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.800]   together with Christ.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.400]   By grace you have been saved."
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:08.040]   Chapter 2, if chapter 1 was a bucket of blessing, or you can say every blessing in Christ, right?
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.440]   So just think of chapter 1, blessing, blessing, blessing.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.920]   God be blessed for blessing us.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.400]   That's chapter 1.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.040]   Chapter 2 was the before and after.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.000]   Chapter 2 was a before and after description of you as an individual.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.720]   You were dead in your transgressions and sins.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.840]   But God being rich in mercy made us alive together with Christ and raised us and seated
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.000]   us with him.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.600]   That's you as an individual receiving the great transformation, the great change, the
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.520]   radical difference going from dead to alive.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.800]   But likewise, the Apostle Paul describes the community.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.240]   That as a community he says, you Gentile people, you are separate and excluded.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.200]   You are a stranger, you are without hope, without God, and you are far off.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.880]   Yes, individually applied, that's also true.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.240]   But he was emphasizing the community aspect of it.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.320]   We are all, all are Gentiles, okay?
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:15.320]   But we were made to be one holy household, a temple, the dwelling of God.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.320]   That's chapter 2.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:23.600]   Chapter 2 is showing us the depth of the difference, the comparison of where you were before.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.640]   The depth from which God has pulled you.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:32.560]   And we have to understand this because if we do not, then not only are we weak, we're
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.760]   so shallow and superficial.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.000]   There's no depth to our understanding.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.400]   There's no depth to our gratitude.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   And therefore if we don't have a depth of understanding, then that means every activity
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.200]   we engage in becomes shallow.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:52.520]   And Apostle Paul recognizes this to be a foundational truth that every single person in any community
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.520]   needs.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:59.800]   If your understanding of your faith and the appreciation you have for the gospel is shallow,
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.080]   you will have shallow unity.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.320]   You will have shallow participation.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.240]   You will have shallow engagement.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.240]   You will have shallow fellowship.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   I mean, think about it.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.880]   There is no unity if you're not sharing any joys.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:19.480]   There is no shared unity if you're not sharing the kind of, wow, gratitudes, the adorations,
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.480]   the same kind of experience.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:26.040]   You think about individuals who have incredible camaraderie because they've survived something
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.040]   tragic together.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:34.160]   Whether it be some kind of disaster, they survived a natural disaster or an act of terrorism
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.000]   and they came out of that realizing we could have been dead.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.360]   But look at us, we're alive now.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.440]   Well if you don't have that kind of depth of experience, you're not going to have any
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.960]   kind of depth of commonality.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:54.040]   And so for the sake of the unity of the church, for the sake of peace, it has to be an understanding
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.040]   of chapter 2.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:02.000]   Now in chapter 3, Apostle Paul says this, and this is a lengthy portion of the text
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.960]   and so I'd like to read it here.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.160]   Apostle Paul in chapter 3 is talking about the amazing love and grace of God.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:15.000]   And he says, "For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.760]   in heaven and on earth derives its name, that he would grant you, according to the riches
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:27.520]   of his glory, to be strengthened with power through his Spirit and in the man, so that
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:33.600]   Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, and that you, being rooted and grounded in
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breath and the lame and
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.360]   the height and the depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge,
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:50.360]   that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God, that in him who is able to do far
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.120]   more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.640]   us, to him be the glory of the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.640]   and ever.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.640]   Amen."
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:09.400]   Considering the work of God, the mystery that was hidden, but now has been made known, the
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.720]   administration of his grace, of how he's giving it out.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:21.920]   He says, "I want you to understand all this, because I want Christ to fill you completely.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.560]   This is going to cause you to be able to stand.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.320]   This is to you true strength."
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.520]   I asked this question as a Bible study question, "What is the prayer of the book of Ephesians?"
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.600]   This is the prayer.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:45.360]   God wants you to have true power, real strength, real empowerment and change.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.760]   And that's not going to come because there were some platitudes given to you.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.400]   That's not come because there were some small encouragements given to you.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.600]   That wasn't going to come because there was some kind of pat on the back.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.280]   That wasn't going to come because, "Oh, those bad guys out there, take some of them out
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.640]   of your life for you."
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:08.840]   The change of your circumstances, the mitigations of your pains, everything else, parallel in
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:14.880]   comparison to having Christ reside right here fully.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.760]   Apostle Paul says, "By faith, I want you to have it."
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.680]   The one true source of true power in our lives.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.600]   Indwelling in you, empowering you.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:31.160]   And so, from there, he is able to give the application, the exhortation.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.240]   So he moved to chapter 4.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:41.160]   Recall that in chapter 4, he begins the whole section of application starting from chapter
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.440]   4 all the way through chapter 6.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:49.040]   "As therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.840]   the calling with which you have been called."
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:17:00.920]   So I remind you, you see now, the theme, yes, is blessings and grace, the gospel.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.360]   But also the theme is true strength.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:10.040]   Because what Apostle Paul is saying is through the indwelling of the Spirit, through the
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:15.960]   faith that you have, this powerful faith that God gives to you, you're going to be able
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.960]   to walk.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.280]   Walk according to all of that.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.120]   To the way that he has called you.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:31.840]   And so, one of the passages that you recall is within the first section of chapter 4,
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.280]   he calls us to walk united as one.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:42.120]   And you think about it, the challenge for us to walk in a manner where we are exercising,
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.280]   he says putting every effort.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:49.600]   It's going to require strength, it's going to require effort, it's going to require long
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.600]   suffering.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:55.080]   And I believe for a lot of people sometimes think that if I have an objective then I have
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.960]   a power just to accomplish it.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.960]   Yes.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:03.320]   But there's another kind of strength where scripture talks about long forbearance, long
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:11.400]   suffering, love that is patient, kind, intent on the well-being and the good of the person
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   that you love.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:19.320]   There is a kind of extended strength of perseverance that is embedded as a requirement or I guess
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:25.040]   a need and a platform by which we build the unity that we long for in the church.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.480]   So what am I saying?
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.240]   Clearly Apostle Paul is challenging us to walk in a certain fashion.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.440]   And what I'm saying is you see this theme that only when you understand the riches that
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.960]   you have, only when you understand the comparison between before and after and the incredible
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:48.800]   love of Christ dwelling in us, can you have the power even to walk like this.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:55.000]   There are some people who think they're strong or they're just like, you know, they're rocks.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.720]   Being a rock just means you're thick, right?
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.200]   There's a kind of strength that comes with vulnerability.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.320]   There's a kind of strength that comes with sacrifice.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:11.240]   There's a kind of strength that comes with all that is involved with building unity.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.720]   And so in the next half of chapter four, Christ talks about, Apostle Paul talks about how
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.120]   all walk needs to be mature in Christ.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.200]   For example, this one I'm just going to read to you.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.240]   So please listen.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.400]   Remember that it says, "As a result, you are no longer," so this is verse 14, sorry, verse
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.400]   14.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   He says that, "We are no longer to be children tossed here or there by waves and carried about
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:43.000]   by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness and deceitful scheming.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.480]   But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.480]   head, even Christ.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.560]   From whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies,
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:58.960]   according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.760]   building up of itself in love."
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.760]   Right?
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.600]   So this I say, "And affirm together with the Lord that you no longer walk as a dental walk
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.160]   in the futility of your mouth."
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:14.880]   So if you take a look there, the challenge again is a walk that is, yes, strong, but
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:21.720]   another way to put it is mature, steady, not being all wishy-washy and being moved by every
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.480]   wind of doctrine, being moved by their own lust and preferences.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.000]   And this is so important.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Think about strength.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.320]   Think about the strength you need.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.760]   You know, sometimes I stray on one side or the other when it comes to strength.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.720]   There are moments when I'm angry about something and I'm just going to bite my tongue and not
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   say anything.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   So I think I'm strong.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.720]   So I'm like, "Ahh!"
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   Right?
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.360]   Yes, that is better than blowing up in anger, but that is not necessarily the height of
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.360]   being strong.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.360]   Why?
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.800]   Because all I've done is clammed up my anger.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.440]   Scripture actually says, "Speak truth."
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:59.640]   Do you realize how much fear, how much of our own selfishness and pride you have to overcome
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.640]   to speak truth?
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.000]   And then there are these people who are like, "Yeah, I'll speak truth.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   I'll tell it like it is.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   I'll tell you what's up."
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.920]   And then you realize, "Well, that's not strong either because that truth is without love."
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.240]   God wants truth to be spoken in love and that takes maturity.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.600]   Combating your own pride, selfishness, checking your own preferences, checking the limitations
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.200]   of your own scope, exercising humility.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.360]   There's a kind of maturity to that.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.280]   And that's all strength in my eyes.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.440]   Next chapter five.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:38.760]   Chapter five, the application of knowing chapter one, all your blessings, chapter two, the
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.480]   great depth of the comparison between before and after, chapter three, the indwelling of
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.200]   the love of God in you.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.520]   He says, "Then imitate God."
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.960]   As an application, imitate God.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:22:00.640]   Recall that this exhortation, emphatic exhortation, told us, "Therefore, be imitators of God as
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:06.920]   beloved children and walk in love just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:15.920]   for us, but offering in a sacrifice to God as a flagrant," sorry, not flagrant, fragrant.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:22.000]   Not a flagrant vow, but more of a fragrant aroma that's pleasing to God.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.280]   We talked about that.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:31.280]   God's desire for us is to be like him.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:37.400]   God's desire for us is to want us to reflect.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.960]   And I want you to understand that because God to us is one of the great, great acts
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:48.720]   of love given to us that we can just meditate and soak in for the rest of our lives.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.720]   What does God want for you?
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.080]   God wants for you what's absolutely best.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.720]   But what's best?
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.640]   What's best is to have the character of God.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:07.600]   So chapter five, there's a lot in there, but chapter five talks about being God-like
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.840]   in holiness.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:13.520]   So scripture says in verse eight, "Walk in light, not in the darkness."
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.240]   What's more, scripture challenges us to discern what is pleasing to God so that we would be
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.320]   like God in his delights.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:27.600]   And you realize that your depravity has much to do with what is pleasing to you.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.360]   Is wickedness pleasing to you?
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.360]   Is selfish pleasure pleasing to you?
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.560]   Is what makes you happy all the vices of the world?
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.280]   Is what's cool in your eyes the things that are detestable?
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.360]   That speaks to your character.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:46.840]   It is to our benefit, it is to our sanctification, holiness, and transformation to delight in
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.640]   the things God delights in.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.600]   Scripture also talks about having the mind of God, verse 15.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.480]   Verse 17 talks about discerning God's will.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:00.480]   Think about this, most of us, we lack of willpower.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.480]   I wish I had more willpower.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.640]   Honestly, like, I'm just confessing to you, there are days you just tell and you're like,
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.840]   "Dragging your knuckles, I don't want to do it."
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.760]   There are things you know you ought to say and do, just don't want to do it.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:23.640]   I mean, diets, exercise, work ethic, things you should say and do for your family.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.640]   Everything I know up here is good and Godly and profitable.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.040]   Just lack willpower.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.920]   Scripture says He wants us to be like God in His intent and will.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:40.040]   But what's more, you recall all the relationships of husband and wife, parent and child, and
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.880]   you recognize God wants us to be like Him, relationally.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.320]   You know what's super lovely?
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.400]   God as Father.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.840]   You know what's super glorious?
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.560]   God as Love.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.720]   The One who has pure intent in His heart.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:06.280]   Sincerity, consistency, unchanging, unwavering, kindness, compassion.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.320]   That's beautiful.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.560]   And He wants that in you and me.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.560]   And that to us is amazing love upon amazing love.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:23.840]   And so, really we want to take this kind of mentality upon us.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.640]   Sure, in the moments when we're not sober, we're like, "I just don't want to do this
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.680]   stuff," or, "It's too hard."
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.160]   But actually we can perceive of it as God's love to us.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:41.080]   And He wants us to be like Him in all motive, in all work ethic, in all of that He is doing
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.200]   to seek to be like God.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.960]   Because truly, there's nothing greater than to be like our Heavenly Father.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.320]   And so, we come to chapter 6.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:56.080]   In chapter 6, Apostle Paul challenged us and said, "Finally, be strong in the Lord and
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.080]   the strength of His might.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:02.200]   Put on the full armor of God so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.200]   of the devil."
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.720]   One of the small group guys in my group just kind of keenly noticed, initially, there seems
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   to be a disconnect.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:15.560]   You go from, "Hey slaves, make sure that you are also exhibiting godliness, even if you
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.560]   are a slave."
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.160]   And, "Hey masters, make sure you're exhibiting godliness, even if you're a master.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.360]   You think you're a peer, you know you have a master in heaven."
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:30.800]   And so, he says, those relational interactions, "You have to be godly.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.800]   You have to be godly."
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:37.040]   And then there's this big jump, and it says, "Finally, brethren, be strong."
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:43.120]   And so, my case in that exhortation to you was, although it may seem like there was a
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:50.720]   quick transition to go from those relationships to an exhortation to be strong, what you realize
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.520]   is that that was the theme of the book so far.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.000]   Not just the only theme, but significantly.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.760]   That the Christian message to us is Christ in us.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:07.440]   And therefore, we have the enablement and the power of Christ.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.000]   We have victory.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:19.120]   So why and how is a slave, a slave, able to be godly in the circumstance of his oppression
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.560]   under human law?
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.480]   What does the scripture say?
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.880]   Because you're a free man in Christ.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.040]   You've got everything in Christ.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:34.960]   You have your liberty, your victory, your voice, everything in Christ.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.520]   And that to him is power.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:43.200]   Power that the owner cannot take away, no slave master can take away, no government
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.200]   can take away.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   And so, he says, "Don't think like them.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:52.880]   Don't succumb to the kind of oppressions that the world tries to put upon you.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.560]   Look at you, man, you're just a slave.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.720]   In our faith we know Christ in me is true liberty.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.040]   If he set me free, I'm free."
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.920]   And so that is power to us, it's strength.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.480]   And so if Apostle Paul is challenging us, you need to be strong in every way.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.600]   You need to be strong and put on the full armor of God.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.720]   And you guys recall that the full armor of God included so many pieces that I'm not going
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.800]   to review today because we did two weeks of it last time.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:28.040]   But you recall, those were first objective truths.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   Gird your loins with the truth.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.040]   There's righteousness.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.520]   But what's more, there's the subjective experience.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.520]   There's the helmet of salvation.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.440]   There's your faith, the shield of faith.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.360]   All those things point to what we have in Christ and the blessings that we have in Christ.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:52.160]   And I made the argument to you that if you do not have those things in clarity, in regularity,
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.720]   then you are weak.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.720]   You're susceptible.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.120]   You're susceptible to all the attacks of the devil.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:05.560]   Now, I do want to talk about this, which is, even in the putting on of the armor, I recognize
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.440]   we should pause a moment to think about God and his love for us.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.160]   What am I talking about?
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:19.360]   I am talking about this, you think about who wants you to put on your helmet.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.160]   And of course, it's typically our loving parents.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.920]   It's dad, it's mom, about to go out for a bike ride.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.880]   It's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, gotta put on that helmet."
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:39.680]   Clearly, God as our Heavenly Father wants us to walk like him, imitate him, as children.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:44.960]   But he also wants us to put on the armor because he is our Heavenly Father who loves us.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.680]   He protects us.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:53.840]   He's given to us all the essential pieces so that we will be strong in Christ.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.720]   Do not fall to be strong outside of Christ.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.640]   Be strong in what God has provided.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:05.280]   This is just a picture of a good father putting on a helmet for his young daughter.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:10.280]   But God, remember I showed you this picture, God's putting on this incredible armor that
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.640]   covers us from head to toe.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:21.160]   But what's more, he has entrusted to us a powerful weapon in the word of God, the scriptures.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.360]   And therefore, we must take full responsibility.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.520]   And he also said, not only are we to put on the armor, but we're supposed to be praying
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:35.240]   in every way at all times, in all types of prayer and petitions, praying, praying, praying,
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.240]   in dependency on God.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.240]   Why?
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.880]   Because that's when you're strong.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.320]   Because that's when you're clear.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.000]   That's when you're solid.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.840]   That's when you have your footing.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.520]   That's when you can fight.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:57.000]   And so I think about the book of Ephesians and clearly, Apostle Paul is in the circumstance.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.720]   I asked this question, where is he now?
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   Just recall, and you guys all know this now because we've talked about it multiple times,
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.720]   he's in jail.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.720]   He's suffering.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.640]   And the people are thinking, oh no, what do we do now?
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.520]   What's going to happen?
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:16.840]   And there was this confidence in Apostle Paul that the word of God is going to proceed in
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.840]   heaven.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:23.160]   And what's more, that even if he's not there, clearly, he's not going to be able to be present
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.160]   with that.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.520]   He has confidence.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.080]   These people are going to find strength in God.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.720]   In the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Savior.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.480]   And what's more, he challenges us to then respond.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   And I want us to meditate and think about this, okay?
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:44.960]   I thought from a perspective of somebody who is just a downer.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.120]   A constant skeptic.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:51.880]   Perhaps somebody who is always playing the devil's advocate.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.240]   And he says, what?
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:59.840]   If God still wants us to be strong, and he's putting on armor, and he's putting a sword
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:05.480]   in our hand, and we're like children, why doesn't he just go ahead and eradicate the
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   enemies?
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.440]   Why not just get rid of the hospitals and oof?
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:16.640]   And there's so many times people in the midst of growing, in the growth process, they're
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.760]   like complaining and whining.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:23.880]   Why can't we be this alternate universe where we do the major thing, we stick the USB into
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.760]   our head, we get the maturity, we get the wisdom, we get the discipline.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.640]   Why can't we just be mature without all this suffering?
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:39.480]   Now sometimes I too say that because of my own stupidity I learned the hard way.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:46.600]   And I think those kind of why, why, why, complaining and whining sometimes actually needs to be
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.160]   answered and then put away.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.840]   It needs to be done.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.760]   It can't keep coming up again.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:57.920]   And what I recognize, number one, is number one, you are the hostile.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.720]   Apostle Paul is teaching you, you are hostile and mild.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.040]   You are in transgression, running with the rest of them, you are sons of disobedience.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.520]   God has no obligation to you.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:14.240]   Only by which of his own volition and his own promise.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.680]   But not because of you.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.120]   He does not owe you a thing.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:25.120]   So if you imagine an alternate universe, yeah, you could get rid of the hostiles, right?
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:31.720]   But the other part of it is I keep thinking, wow, what love of the Father.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:40.760]   God is not just simply making things be without consideration of the growth of his children.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:45.760]   That we would be able to learn how to love like he does.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:52.360]   He wants us to love with faith and then he wants us to have an incorruptible love in
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.360]   all hearts.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.360]   Think about that.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:59.240]   I got high expectations for children.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:04.480]   I think about that, I'm like, my love is fickle.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.960]   My love has moods.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.120]   My love has seasons.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.320]   My love has limitations.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.120]   My love is just sometimes weak thoughts.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.640]   It's sometimes naive, has no energy or like, you know, awareness.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.440]   My love is just flawed in so many ways.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:29.680]   But what God is building into us through his Son and his Spirit and his Word is his kind
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.680]   of love.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:35.800]   And that to me is the amazing love of the Father.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:42.840]   To tell his children, I want you to learn like I love.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.320]   And so be it that we're left in this world to love the brethren.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.520]   Yes, Lord, I want to learn.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.640]   Teach me to love like you do.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:56.160]   What a good exhortation for us as we end this book.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:01.080]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.760]   Lord, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:09.760]   And as we take a step back to look at what you've done.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.480]   Lord, we're amazed at Apostle Paul.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:22.680]   This is, this is the incredible treasure of treasures that you have been working for generations
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:30.760]   upon generations to call people to yourself who were wretched.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.760]   So sinful.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:40.680]   And to take them, to wash them, to purify them, to cleanse us.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.680]   We thank you so much.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:47.400]   This to us, Lord, is the bedrock upon which we stand.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.400]   Is your love for us.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:56.680]   And so I pray God that every single one of us, if we're lacking strength or lacking motivation
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:01.520]   or lacking willpower, help us to come back to this.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.480]   Through Christ Jesus, our Lord, we have you as our heavenly father.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.680]   Good, perfect, holy.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.920]   But we have the parental love.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:15.280]   Teaching us, guiding us, and leading us to your likeness.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.680]   And for that we thank you.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.320]   And we commit ourselves to you, to follow you in every way.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.120]   We thank you, Lord, in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:22.560]   Amen.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.300]   (tranquil music)
