[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.280]   - Hi, welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.200]   My name is Pastor Nate.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.360]   I'm the college pastor here at this church.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.320]   This is our building.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.480]   This is where we meet for Sunday worship,
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.240]   Friday night Bible studies,
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.160]   fellowship events are sometimes taking place here.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.680]   And this is the central gathering place for our church.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.840]   Okay, this is the inside of our sanctuary.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.480]   Right here is where we gather together every Friday night
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.120]   to do our Bible studies.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.120]   Bible study is exactly what it sounds like.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.000]   It's a study of the Bible.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.280]   We come together to understand what God has to say to us,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.920]   rather than us trying to take meaning out of the text
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.840]   based upon our own thinking.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.280]   Now we do have both options here of virtual and physical,
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.320]   especially because of this time period during the pandemic.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.440]   About half our student body
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.080]   is physically going to be with us,
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.080]   half of us are going to be joining
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.640]   through our Facebook Live on Friday nights as well.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.440]   Beyond that, the only thing you need to know
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.240]   is that we are studying the book of 1 Corinthians.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.280]   It's been an exciting time,
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.680]   so we would like you to come and join us
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.780]   during the school year.
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.360]   (upbeat music)
