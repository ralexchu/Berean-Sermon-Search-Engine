[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   >> Well, good morning.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.340]   Greetings from the Saints at Lighthouse San Diego.
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.960]   Here is a dear friend and my mentor.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:21.160]   And I remember those of you old school folks when we were like 30, 40 here and just to
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.680]   see what God has done.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.640]   Huge encouragement to me.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:35.160]   And so it's a great privilege and joy to be with you for many reasons, but especially
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.560]   because of this topic that I would like to address.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.280]   Even as His people, it's a subtle temptation to allow the wonder provoking, deeply personal
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.280]   truth of our adoption in Christ to become kind of like some mere fine print of our great
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.280]   salvation.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.200]   It's to our contemporary joylessness and ineffectual pursuits and missionary complacency that we
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.720]   either forget or functionally fail to believe that God our Father by His unstoppable grace
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.960]   pursued us, forgave us, embraced us, loves us, cares for us.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.520]   See, it's not at all enough to have heard that Christ died for sinners.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.040]   It's not salvation at all to merely give intellectual assent to the truth that salvation is by grace
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.620]   alone through faith alone.
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.440]   Even demons and enemies of the cross of Christ know that, James 2.19.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.400]   It is nowhere close to being born again to only say that we really, really respect Jesus
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.080]   and we're trying very hard to live a good life.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.600]   Such are grossly insufficient in of themselves and by themselves.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.720]   So it's possible to believe even sincerely that one is going to heaven because of one's
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.520]   church attendance or one's moral performance or baptism or coming to the front or some
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.760]   past emotional experience or by one's friendly association with many Christians.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.360]   And yet sadly, still be as lost as lost can be.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.960]   No instead because of Christ's love, God's children will believe and say with every fiber
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.520]   of their being, tears welling up in their eyes for sheer gratitude and for the elation
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.400]   of being in relationship with the Father.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.240]   That His Son died for me.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:46.200]   Save me, is merciful to me, disciplines me, is transforming me, cares for me, is for me,
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.880]   me of all people, this most unworthy sinner.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.000]   Adoption is doubly personal to me.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.920]   First because my wife, Sandy, and I have three precious children, Tobias, Piper, and Kristen,
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.920]   whom we love with all our hearts.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.760]   I'm so proud of my children, especially my older two and how they have embraced our
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.480]   youngest.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.760]   I am humbled by my wife, her compassion.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.600]   She's really the force behind this.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.960]   And a part of our family's story though is our youngest, of course, was adopted by us
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.480]   nearly eight years ago.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.720]   The day of our adoption concluded our joyful yet difficult journey of three and a half
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.880]   years as foster parents, actually with Olive Crest here in Orange County.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.400]   Prior to her, we had the blessing of caring for four other children of varying ages and
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.280]   varying needs and trauma, Elena, Ignacio, Jose, and Isabella.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.360]   It was no romantic journey, at times extremely humbling and painful because of what we've
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.600]   seen these children go through, because of the way our own sins and weaknesses were exposed
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.280]   as a married couple, because of the frustrations and fallenness of our foster system, because
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:15.200]   of the way family, friends, and even church members criticized us or opposed us, let alone
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:23.920]   the plight of these kids coming out of the brokenness of our very own local communities.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.480]   So at times in the process, let me be honest, there are moments we felt abandoned like the
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.400]   ones that we were caring for.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.600]   Then when those children were reunited with their birth families, we were simultaneously
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.440]   rejoicing as well as devastated that we had to let them go.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.880]   However, we were more concerned what it would cost them to not be cared for than what it
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.600]   would cost us to care for them.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.440]   It was devastating to lose them, but it was totally worth it to have the opportunity to
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.520]   love them.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:14.200]   We had Ignacio for almost six months, and we wept for days after he left our home.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:24.760]   Even saying his name is emotional for me, even almost a decade later.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.840]   I remember falling into a season of depression, but through that the Lord was working in our
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:38.440]   hearts and I was reminded of something I knew in my head but did not remember in my heart,
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.520]   that the pursuit of adoption, like all godly parenting, is not about me.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.360]   It is not about fulfilling the desires of dad and mom.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:57.280]   It is about the glory of God and loving others, that Christ loves us.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.200]   So we were happy to see their lives and homes become whole again.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.360]   Therefore, it was a joy and is a joy to be a part of that.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.040]   Right now, Kristen, as our precious daughter, is grace, undeserved grace beyond words.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:21.000]   Some have said to us, well-intentioned, Kristen is so blessed to have you, but we don't ever
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   think or feel that way.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.360]   No, we are the blessed ones.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.960]   We get to be her parents and her family.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.160]   I get to be daily confronted with the things that are disease-ridden in my own soul, thus
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.480]   with my own need for God, my Father.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.080]   I get to hold her in my arms as her daddy and point her to Jesus.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.640]   We are the blessed ones.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.240]   A second reason is super personal to me, is something that most people who meet me don't
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.640]   know, that I too was adopted.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.600]   That might be a surprise to some, but it really shouldn't be.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.800]   The thing is, I wasn't an orphan in the way that most people think.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.240]   No, I was in a condition far more serious, horrible, and desperate.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:13.040]   I was a total stranger, a willful outsider, a slave of sin, an enemy of God, a zealous,
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.480]   rebellious blasphemer, an object of the just wrath of God.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.040]   I had no desire for Him.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.320]   At times, I intentionally expressed my hatred for Him.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.720]   At other times, I only mechanically conformed to people's expectations of what a good boy
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.520]   should be.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.720]   But then, God mercifully, mercifully interfered, intervened.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.520]   He intercepted me on the path that I had been on, and I heard the good news of God's grace
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.520]   in the gospel.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.880]   And as I listened, God regenerated my flat-lined, dead heart to believe.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.360]   He convicted me of my sinfulness, my cosmic treason, my spiritual bankruptcy, my utter
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:03.720]   inability to save myself, and I stopped running away from God, and I ran to Him.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:09.520]   Up until my conversion, I hadn't ever known happiness like that my entire life.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.020]   And so I wanted to tell people, I had to tell people what happened to me and for me and
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:23.000]   how God had loved me and how God still loves me, not because of me, but despite me.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.640]   And so I did tell people, and though I was not conscious of it yet at the time, I was
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:37.480]   also welcomed to heaven's praises into a new family, where God the Creator, the righteous
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:45.840]   judge became instantly, eternally, and only my perfect Father.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.000]   It's precisely because of the privileges of God's adoption of us in Christ that my wife,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.960]   Sandy, and I were strongly compelled to pray, ponder, plan, and pursue adoption, even in
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.920]   our dating fellowship time, in our engagement, and into our marriage.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.720]   It has only served to deepen our understanding of the gospel, fueled our zeal to be salt
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:18.800]   and light, and allowed us to know more intimately God's great love for us and His church.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:24.360]   D. F. Packer in Knowing God wrote, "To be right with God the judge is a great thing,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.040]   but to be loved and cared for by God the Father is greater."
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.120]   John Piper adds, "Adoption is not good news if it only puts us in God's family, but not
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.120]   also in His arms."
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:43.800]   Turn with me, if you would, to the eighth chapter of Romans, Romans chapter 8, Romans
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:49.280]   chapter 8, starting from verse 14, Romans chapter 8.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.560]   Due to time, of course, this is not all that could be said biblically about adoption, nor
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:02.640]   will it be a full exposition as might normally occur with me, but more of a doctrinal application
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.120]   for us on this Orphan Sunday.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.820]   Romans chapter 8, starting from verse 14.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.720]   This is the word of the Lord, "For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.040]   are sons of God.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:24.320]   For you have not received the spirit of slavery, leading to fear again, but you have received
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:30.840]   the spirit of adoption, as sons by which we cry out, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.980]   The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:41.960]   And if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:47.620]   suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:52.500]   Verse 18, "For I consider the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.700]   with the glory that is to be revealed to us.
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:02.480]   For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.040]   For the creation was subjected to futility not willingly, but because of Him who subjected
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:13.360]   it in hope that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.960]   into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.000]   For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.600]   until now.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.800]   And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:38.040]   we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly, waiting eagerly for our adoption
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.080]   as sons, the redemption of our body.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.280]   Will you join with me in prayer?
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.680]   Let's pray.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:57.200]   Father, this is your word, and so not a word of it fails, and every syllable of it is true.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.480]   We need it more than our necessary food.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.360]   For we do not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds from you.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:11.480]   Let us know the pure gold of its truth, the sweetness of its application, the need of
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:17.040]   humility to penetrate the obvious cracks of our latent self-righteousness.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.640]   Renew our minds with the matchless joy of freshly understanding your sovereign mercy
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.200]   that your kindness leads us to repentance.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:32.280]   In your grace, do that life abundant and everlasting.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:37.900]   Give us eyes to see as your objective revelation bears on our hearts so that by the work of
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:46.640]   your Spirit we might submit ourselves exhaustively and exclusively to you, right now and not
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.480]   some tomorrow.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.640]   Engrave in us that we are not our own, that we've been crucified with Christ and we no
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.840]   longer live, but Christ now lives in us.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.800]   Awaken us to the fact that this life is short, that we have no business worshipping the idol
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.040]   of convenience, the idol of natural children or no children, the false gods of our own
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.200]   plans.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.080]   To repent of such spiritual adultery, that our new identity is reason to prioritize true
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:18.760]   priorities to lay our treasures in heaven and not in our stuff.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:26.120]   That we both ought to and that we now can walk in a manner worthy of the gospel.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.400]   Overwhelm us by your greatness and grace into the white-hot affection of genuine worship
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.080]   and daily discipleship as we consider our own adoption.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.160]   We give you homage.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.080]   We bow beneath your good authority.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.120]   Encourage your people greatly this morning.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:49.720]   We entrust ourselves into your perfect, timely, and fatherly care this Lord's Day.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.520]   In Jesus' name, for Jesus' sake we pray, amen.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:02.760]   Can I get my water bottle?
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:10.600]   I don't think I'm used to preaching two services, so.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.840]   All the more props to your pastors.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.280]   Well three things today.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.360]   Number one, I want us to see the gospel importance of our adoption.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.820]   The gospel importance of our adoption.
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.720]   That we have been granted new freedom.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.920]   We've been granted new freedom.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.440]   The gospel importance of our adoption.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.320]   Adoption is at the heart of the gospel.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.080]   That we're saved by God, from God, to know God.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.320]   That though we deserve punishment as rebels, we experience the greatest joy of all possible
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.160]   joys.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.600]   Receiving the right to become children of God.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.320]   He redeems us from slavery to sin and Satan from the broad road that leads to destruction.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.840]   And he frees us, again not because of us, but despite us.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:06.800]   Martin Lloyd-Jones once asked, "For some inexplicable reason, it is a doctrine, the
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:12.760]   doctrine of adoption, about which we very rarely hear about.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:18.520]   When was the last time, if ever," he asked, "that you heard a sermon on the doctrine
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.520]   of adoption?"
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.520]   G.I.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.080]   Packer went even further.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.400]   I love what he wrote.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:29.480]   He says, "If you want to judge how well a person understands Christianity, find out
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.720]   how much he makes of the thought of being God's child and having God as his father.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.680]   If this is not the thought that prompts and controls his worship and prayers and his whole
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:45.200]   outlook on life, he says it means that he does not understand Christianity very well
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.880]   at all."
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.400]   Our adoption is vital, transforming truth.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.800]   Paul declares in our text, in verses 14 to 15, "For all who are being led by the Spirit
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.600]   of God, these are sons of God, for yet not received the spirit of slavery leading to
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.600]   fear again."
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:08.800]   Now, one of the distinguishing marks of true believers in this letter to the Romans is
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.960]   that the Spirit of God lives in them and leads them.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.600]   So a person is either controlled by the flesh or by the Spirit, Paul says, and he's a child
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.320]   of God or a child of Satan.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.400]   Now we might not like to hear that, but the Bible says it's either one or the other.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.960]   And by nature, the former is true and by grace alone, the latter becomes true.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.360]   Romans 1, we know, states that everyone believes that God exists.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:42.280]   So there are really genuinely, the actuality is there's really, there are no true atheists
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.640]   or agnostics.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.120]   Rather man in his, natural man in his prideful independence instead chooses to suppress the
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.800]   truth in unrighteousness.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.960]   Prefers to live in denial and lie to himself, trying to escape any notion of accountability,
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:03.880]   even while ironically holding everyone else but himself to account.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.640]   Giving God the hand, he questions God's greatness and goodness only to exalt his own supposed
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.280]   greatness and goodness.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.080]   And that's what we are seeing all around us in our society.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:22.440]   Romans 3, 23 says, "We've all sinned," past tense, "and fall short," present tense, "of
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.920]   the glory of God."
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:33.600]   Romans 5, 6 adds that the sinner is not needing help, but is absolutely helpless.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:39.760]   To be helpless apart from God is also to be hopeless apart from God.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.460]   The late David Pallison said it well, "The core insanity of the human heart is that we
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.520]   violate the first great commandment."
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:54.640]   And he says this, "We will love anything except God unless our madness is checked by
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.640]   grace."
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:00.440]   But the good news is God has made a way in his love.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:05.400]   From the moment of the fall, God promised in Genesis 3, 15, the proto-evangelium, a
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.840]   future seed who would crush the head of the serpent.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.560]   That seed was the promised Messiah.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.220]   And over and over again in the redemptive saga, the human lineage of the Messiah was
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:21.500]   on the verge of extinction against all odds, humanly speaking.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:26.800]   But that line was sovereignly preserved all the way to our Lord Jesus.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.940]   This sovereign rescue was no accident.
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:35.440]   This redemption was no plan B. Turn with me, if you will, to Ephesians chapter 1.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.880]   Ephesians chapter 1, looking at verse 4.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.080]   Ephesians chapter 1, verse 4.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:50.200]   There it declares, Paul says, "He chose us in Him."
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.880]   Ephesians 1, verse 4, "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.900]   will be holy and blameless before Him.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.960]   In love He predestined us to," speak to me, what does it say?
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.960]   Adoption, right?
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.860]   "He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ Himself according to the kind
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:13.340]   intention of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace which He freely bestowed
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.040]   on us in the Beloved."
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:21.440]   Interestingly, John Stott comments on this text.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:28.000]   He says, "He destined us for a higher dignity that even creation would bestow upon us.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.840]   He intended to adopt us."
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:40.280]   We were loved long before we actually experienced God's love.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:48.840]   Creation was loved in my family's heart long before she ever came into our lives physically.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.680]   Romans 5, verse 8 says, "God demonstrates His own love for us in this, that while we
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.440]   are still sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:01.200]   Galatians 4, verse 4-5 declares, "But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:11.640]   His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, so that purpose, so that He might redeem those
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:20.280]   who are under the law, that purpose, we might receive the adoption as sons."
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:26.560]   In other words, our redemption rests not in our choosing Him, but in His choosing us.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.640]   Is that not a picture of what adoption looks like?
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.560]   Now not in a creeper way, but sometimes when my kids are asleep, I quietly go into their
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:45.540]   room and I watch them sleep peacefully and stare at them and admire them, right?
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.440]   And then I pray for them.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.040]   My kids were here in the first service, so they're a little weird out when they heard
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:58.120]   that, but...
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.520]   And each of them is different and special.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.200]   When I look at my daughter, Kristen, and I don't think a week doesn't go by where I think
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:14.480]   this, I look at her and I wonder how different her life might have been and how different
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.960]   my life might have been.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.200]   Perhaps she might have perpetuated a generational cycle of dysfunction, sin, and heartache,
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:28.160]   private things I will not share, but of course I cannot know for sure.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.680]   But her former heritage had been spiraling down long before she ever came into the world
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.920]   and it threatened to pull her underneath its waves.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:42.240]   Today she is just our adorable daughter and Toby and Piper's younger sister, but like
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.860]   the rest of us, she is also a sinner.
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:53.600]   So sometimes she can be a very difficult person to live with, like her daddy.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:59.160]   That makes me pause and ponder with gratitude, where would I be right now if my father in
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:04.280]   heaven didn't adopt me?
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.280]   I don't know.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.920]   I think I would be in prison or dead or trying to make it rich and find my happiness and
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:15.100]   possessions and probably be miserable or I'd be deceived about my supposed happiness, which
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.180]   would be much worse.
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:24.320]   But I think of those possibilities as a man filled with deeply suppressed rage as a youth,
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.280]   momentarily erupting but always growing.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.320]   I sometimes think apart from God's grace and intervention I would have eventually reaped
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:38.420]   the consequences of my violent heart and ended up dead or in prison.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.920]   I didn't seek fights, but I welcomed them.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:48.440]   I'd be far from his blessing, but that wasn't God's will.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.480]   Romans 8.1, "Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.320]   My debt is fully paid in Christ.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.400]   I am justified.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.080]   I have no criminal record.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:05.440]   I've been adopted as one of his children and the Holy Spirit lives in me."
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.200]   Romans 8.28, many of us know that text.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.200]   That is his totality.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:18.240]   Let me remind us that it says, "All things are working together for," I'll put it personal
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.440]   for me, "my good.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:24.160]   For I've been predestined, called, justified, and being sanctified will be glorified so
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:30.400]   that one day I will be as," the next verse says, verse 29, "be conformed to the image
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.620]   of his Son."
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:39.720]   So that as an adopted one, the last verse of this chapter, verse 39, "so that nothing
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.640]   will be able to separate me from the love of God."
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:50.160]   John MacArthur wrote, "The old life of the adopted person is completely obliterated.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.560]   It is as if he was born the day he was adopted.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.640]   He is like a new person who just started his life."
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.520]   Thomas Watson, in contemplating our adoption, weeped, "God has a son of his own and such
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.320]   a son."
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.160]   How wonderful God's love in adopting us.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:15.040]   And Watson says this, "We needed a father but he did not need sons."
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:20.860]   Number two, want us to see the glorious identification in our adoption.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:25.880]   The glorious identification in our adoption that we've been given new family.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.880]   The glorious identification.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.440]   We've been given new family.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:36.000]   Romans 8, verse 15, "But you have received the spirit of adoption as sons by which we
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.360]   cry out, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.280]   It's an affectionate term but it's a reverential one nevertheless.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:50.540]   I don't think daddy exactly captures it but there's a spirit of that.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:54.160]   But there is affection, there is love.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.880]   The spirit says, testifies with our spirit that we are children of God.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:04.960]   Verse 16, "The humble request for forgiveness becomes the intimate confidence of belonging
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:11.160]   that we could affectionately say without any fear of rejection, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.440]   He approaches the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.760]   There's no spirit of fear, no spirit of slavery, but the spirit of sonship, the spirit of acceptance
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:27.080]   and assurance, the spirit of intimate access, of really belonging that he's my father.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.840]   There's an old story of a boy who was the son of the town's judge and his friends, they
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:38.320]   wanted to do something awful, namely to steal something from the local store.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.160]   But he didn't want to do it.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:45.840]   So his friends teased him saying, "You won't do it because you're afraid your father, the
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.840]   judge, will hurt you."
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:55.160]   Suddenly that devoted son responded, "I'm not afraid my father will hurt me, I'm afraid
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.160]   to hurt my father."
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:02.600]   See, that, that, that, beyond that response is the loving spirit of devoted sonship.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.920]   That's the heart of all of us as believers, is it not?
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:10.640]   As adoptive parents, my wife and I have received all kinds of strange looks, to be honest.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:16.200]   You know, they double take, you know, when my wife comes and they see our child doesn't
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:21.520]   look as Asian.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.880]   And we've been asked all kinds of insensitive questions.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:32.680]   I don't usually think it's out of any malice, which only reveals my own need for grace to
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.040]   respond with grace.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.180]   It doesn't bother me now.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:45.960]   But let me suggest it reveals a flawed understanding that many believers have about the gospel.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.240]   Inevitably someone will say to us, "Oh, she's adopted?
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.720]   I thought so.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.600]   So are those your real children?"
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:03.920]   To which Sandy and I will respond, "They're all our real children."
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.280]   That is to say, Kristen isn't a second-class child.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:11.440]   She's fully our child, truly our daughter, truly belongs, equally beloved as our birth
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.680]   children, so we're fine.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:19.120]   We're happy to explain the reality that she's been adopted because it's a part of her past
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.280]   as much as mine.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.800]   But as Russell Moore wrote, "Adopted is a past tense verb, not an adjective."
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.800]   Let me repeat that.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:34.120]   "Adopted is a past tense verb, not an adjective."
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:40.840]   See what we don't do or shouldn't do is go around introducing her as our adopted daughter.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:47.120]   Mrs. Toby Piper and our adopted daughter Kristen as some kind of qualifier or acknowledgement
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:53.840]   of some ongoing difference, of some inequality or inferiority or lack of belonging.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:28:00.920]   That is anti-love, anti-family, anti-church, anti-gospel, anti-Christ.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.600]   I mean we don't go around usually or shouldn't go around introducing people in our lives
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:11.920]   as, "Here's my short friend," or "My blonde cousin," or "My smartest child," or "My divorced
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.280]   parents," or "My Jewish or black or republic co-worker."
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.680]   You get the point.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:25.960]   I've had relatives and even two pastors tell me not to adopt foster kids because supposedly
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.400]   they are damaged beyond repair.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:38.000]   Listen, knowing that's just wicked nonsense, I'm not minimizing the fact that there are
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.520]   very difficult situations and different callings.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.800]   And this is not the only ministry that you and I may be called to.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:55.040]   I suggest that most of you might not.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.200]   It was humbling to be a foster parent for many reasons.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   I mean there was a non-Christian couple in our classes.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:15.120]   They adopted three Down syndrome children.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:23.040]   So those two pastors told me not to adopt because they're damaged.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.920]   What are they then saying about our gospel hope and God's power?
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.440]   Come on now.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.920]   The spiritual reality is that we're all damaged.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.600]   We're all special needs children.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.640]   We all need the same hope and anyone can be transformed by the power of God.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.640]   Anyone.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.640]   Anyone.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.880]   Again, that doesn't mean it's easy.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.880]   It's not.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:55.240]   A couple in our church have adopted a child who they later discovered is on the spectrum.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.240]   And it's hard.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.240]   It's hard.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.840]   It's hard.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.040]   But we all didn't belong but now we do.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:11.120]   Let us never be ashamed to say that we've all been adopted.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.520]   Past tense.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:17.080]   For it is a very important, wonderful part of our testimony to celebrate.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.240]   Right, brothers and sisters?
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.640]   Let us never think that it means any single one of us here are anything less than his
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:30.960]   children equal in Christ, equal in dignity, equal in salvation, equally loved by God even
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.920]   though we might have different roles within it.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:40.700]   Christians should know more than anyone there is no superiority or inferiority among us.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:48.440]   The gospel of grace calls for reconciliation and not reparations.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:55.080]   We know the power of the gospel.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:01.480]   First Corinthians 12, 13 to 15 reads, "For by one spirit we are all baptized into one
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.760]   body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.600]   one spirit, for the body is not one member but many.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.480]   If the foot says, 'Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,' it is not for
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.240]   this reason any less a part of the body."
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:23.880]   Ephesians chapter 2, 12 to 14, we remember that you all at the time were separate from
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.960]   Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.160]   promise having no hope and without God in the world.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.160]   But now in Christ Jesus, you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.800]   blood of Christ.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.980]   For he himself is our peace who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.840]   of the dividing wall.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:49.360]   Ephesians 4, 2 to 6 says, "There is one body and one spirit, just as you also you
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:54.720]   are called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.560]   Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.120]   Seven times he says one.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:08.400]   Meet any true Christian anywhere in the world, regardless of the language and cultural barriers,
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:14.000]   and you instantly know there is a bond with that person.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.840]   Because in Christ, I not only have a new father, I have a new family.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.160]   Listen y'all, family has never been about blood.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.440]   It's always been about belonging.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.840]   Family is not about blood, but about belonging.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.000]   Family is not about blood, but about belonging.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:43.600]   Let me speak to those in Asian cultures who perpetuate a racist mindset otherwise.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:49.160]   When Julius Caesar adopted Octavius as his son and his legal heir, it allowed him to
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:54.940]   succeed his father as Emperor Caesar Augustus.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:58.740]   There was no inferior status due to his past adoption.
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:03.760]   It is not that we are saved, that we get to live then outside in some doghouse on the
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.840]   outskirts of heaven so that at least we're not in hell.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:12.200]   It's not that we merely get a safe place of refuge away from immediate harm, like some
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:19.960]   foster homes that are sometimes cold and loveless, where you will get food, clothing, shelter,
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.960]   and not get beaten by family members.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:27.280]   That's certainly better than being hungry, naked, or abused, but there are a lot of places
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:35.440]   you can receive those necessities and yet feel profoundly empty, abandoned, and without
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.900]   a sense of belonging.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:43.720]   Not the least ounce of feeling loved and actually being loved.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:49.160]   Our adoption, our adoption in Christ is much more than receiving legal forgiveness and
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:54.040]   justification which is already monumentally more than we deserve.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:59.040]   It is much more than just freedom and protection from our former father the devil.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.240]   It is much, much more than getting our own bed to sleep in and not having to wonder where
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.760]   our next meal is coming from or even dreaming about what new toy we're going to get from
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.040]   the next charity that rolls into town.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.640]   No, it means we belong.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.560]   It means a home, a forever family where we are loved.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:25.560]   For some of us, perhaps, the church is the first family in which we experience love.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.020]   Why?
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.160]   Because of the inherent goodness of man?
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.480]   No.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:38.120]   Because his imperfect people are compelled by the love of Christ.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.520]   When the first Christians who were Jews asked, "Are the Gentile believers really one of us,
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.120]   part of us?"
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.920]   The answer, of course, from God was, "Yes, they are.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.920]   Of course.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.960]   They're brothers and sisters more so than your natural family."
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.400]   Sadly in churches today, brother or sister sometimes is just a metaphor for a friend
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.880]   or acquaintance or our consumeristic preferences about which church we'd rather go to.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.960]   What programs do I get?
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.560]   How eloquent the preaching is?
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:11.080]   How big the church or similar people are to me or what will I get or not get by going
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.160]   there?
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:19.700]   Life is not about you.
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:24.000]   Life is not about you or I.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.720]   My friend John Kim, Pastor John Kim said, "Love is the litmus test of Christianity to
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:32.320]   show whether your claims to faith are genuine or not.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.760]   You live out the great commandment to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul,
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.440]   mind, and strength and love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.600]   Jesus said it better, "By this, all men will know that you are my disciples if you have
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.160]   love for one another."
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:51.060]   Remember, you and I do not just have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:55.480]   We have a corporate relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:03.360]   When given a family, we're not just given privileges, but we're given responsibilities.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.560]   And I pray that you are an active part of that as a member and not just a spectator
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.640]   from the seats.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.960]   Your understanding about spiritual adoption has a lot to say about your pursuit of church
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:19.520]   unity, forgiveness, practicing to one another, sacrificial kingdom giving, not being divisive,
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.800]   about loyalty to your leaders and fellow members.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.280]   Here we must not be preferentially choosing who our friends will be.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.800]   No, we are brothers and sisters with the same loving Father.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.640]   Now I understand that a church this size, we may not know everyone well.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.760]   That is okay.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:45.000]   But we better look at each other as brothers and sisters, as family.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.400]   As new creations of Christ, we've been given a radically new life, new identity, new family,
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.680]   new direction, new hope.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.400]   At Kristen's adoption hearing, the judge and attorneys on both sides, they asked us
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.160]   some very surprising questions, at least to us.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:03.600]   For example, they asked, "Are you going to treat Kristen as your same as your birth children?"
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.240]   How could you ask that?
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.240]   Right?
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.240]   Of course.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:13.240]   "Are you going to give her a full inheritance and all the rights of your other children?"
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:17.000]   I mean, I can't imagine the cruelty of anything less.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.960]   It was a foregone conclusion, in our hearts, we love her.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:25.200]   John Calvin said about this text that the primary work of the Holy Spirit, as the Holy
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:31.080]   Spirit is mentioned here, is to convince us of the gift of our sonship, ensuring and then
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:37.960]   testifying to our hearts that we do belong, that we are children.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.000]   Ancient Rome's adoption process actually requires seven witnesses in the transaction.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.760]   The question is why?
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:49.480]   Well, what happens if, when the father dies, if the birth children are resenting the adopted
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:56.120]   son who is the heir and then try to accuse him of having an illegitimate claim?
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:02.880]   So in the Roman Empire, they required seven witnesses to protect the adopted son's rights.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:07.520]   But listen, we don't need seven witnesses.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.800]   We just need one.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:17.240]   Verse 16 says the Holy Spirit testifies, witnesses that we are children of God.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.800]   As a Christian, I didn't belong, but now I do belong.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:26.560]   Fully, really, truly, publicly, completely, joyfully, eternally, I belong and God is my
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.400]   father forever.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:36.920]   At Christian's adoption hearing, I never forgot how Sandy and I, we're pretty calm and excited
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:43.140]   but of all places to just start bawling like crazy, was when the lawyers and judge were
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:48.200]   exchanging all the legal verbiage that had just confirmed the permanent reality that
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:54.080]   we are not just her parents functionally, but also now legally.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:58.600]   I was born in California, code 94698.127, all this stuff.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.680]   It's just like, look, weepy, right?
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.440]   That's when we lost it.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.760]   And I remember, I remember, why, why at that point?
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:17.040]   You know, it's because I realized that she was no longer a ward of the state and trusted
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:25.120]   into our temporary care as her foster parents, but she became ours and we became hers.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.140]   After a year of caring for her as though she was our own, she was not legally ours until
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:36.860]   that point, so as her dad, I could finally say with joyful authority, she's mine.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.740]   The legality of it is still very important.
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:43.580]   It is not some bureaucratic red tape.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.940]   It is real and it's pictured in the gospel.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:55.580]   Our justification in Christ is not just a legal forensic positional righteousness.
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:40:00.620]   It is deeply and mutually personal.
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.540]   Kristen's birth certificate was permanently changed.
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.660]   Mom didn't actually get to name her.
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.260]   She fled.
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:12.060]   So baby, last name.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:20.460]   New name, new identity, new inheritance, new father, new future, new trajectory.
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.540]   Isn't that similar to salvation?
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:28.220]   Milton Vincent wrote, "When I see the cross, I see the premium that God places on the works
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:33.100]   that he has prepared for me to do.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:38.580]   How valuable all of these works must be if Christ would die so that I might perform them."
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:45.020]   At least with Kristen, we're seeing by God's grace that the multi-generational cycle of
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:49.140]   neglect has now been broken, is still being broken by her adoption.
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.980]   Not only is her life being changed, so is ours.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:41:00.140]   And our prayer is her story of hope goes beyond her to her kids and their kids and their kids.
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.540]   And also we pray for their birth family.
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:08.660]   That God would reap joyous change through the glory of God.
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:18.260]   However, let me suggest all of that pales in comparison to our gospel stories.
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:23.140]   When we've been redeemed, set apart into his omnipotently loving fatherhood, sovereignly
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:28.780]   adopted to a certain and glorious hope, many of us are still deeply scarred by a very painful
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.340]   past, especially in our home life.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.020]   But they do not have to define us.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:41.020]   Listen, though the gospel does not erase our past, it does redeem us where we are.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:46.300]   Jason Johnson said, "The gospel like adoption is a multi-generational story of love.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:51.260]   It breaks our past cycles, forms our new realities, and offers us a future hope unburdened by
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.140]   the broken context from which we originated."
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:42:01.140]   Then he concludes, "He secures our futures and changes the trajectory of our lives forever."
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.220]   Which leads us into the final point.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:07.340]   Number three, the great inheritance of our adoption.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:12.300]   The great inheritance of our adoption that we are guaranteed a new future.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.420]   A new future.
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:20.260]   Romans 8 verse 17, "And if children heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ,
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:24.500]   if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.940]   For I consider the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.780]   glory that is to be revealed to us.
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:34.740]   For the anxious longing of creation waits eagerly for what?
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:38.180]   The revealing of the sons of God."
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:44.980]   So in one sense, we are told here in our text that we are right now the children of God.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:50.820]   But in another sense, that sonship has not yet been fully consummated.
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:43:00.060]   Thus, we've yet to receive the full benefits of our present day adoption.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:03.960]   See, it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:09.620]   So we, along with the rest of creation, eagerly await for it.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.620]   For what?
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:14.100]   The full revealing of the sons or the children of God.
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:15.780]   Our position in Christ is rock solid.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:16.780]   Our hope is certain.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.340]   It is not wishful thinking.
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:22.380]   We will arrive because Christ takes us there.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.540]   We are fellow heirs with Christ.
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:27.060]   We will receive brand new resurrection bodies.
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:31.760]   We are now freed from the penalty of sin, being freed from the power of sin.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:37.280]   And one day we will be freed from the very presence of sin.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:44.660]   First John 3, verse 1 says, "See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.320]   should be called children of God."
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.060]   And so we are.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:55.860]   First Peter 1, 3 to 5 reads, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.620]   According to His great mercy, He has caused us to be born again to a living hope.
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:04.900]   Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable,
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:12.100]   undefiled, unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God's power, not ours, are being guarded
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:18.060]   through faith for salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time."
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:28.440]   Name one thing on earth that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.520]   Probably three things that are eternal.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:34.000]   God, His Word, and souls.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.080]   That's where our priority should be.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.020]   Our adoption in Christ ought to radically change our perspective.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:46.320]   We should be living in a way that reflects our glorious, incredible future.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:51.640]   Joyfully, obediently, courageously, faithfully.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:58.520]   I mean, I think we tend to wonder if you're single, "When will I get married?
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.600]   Where might we be ten years from now?
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.680]   How old will we be when we retire?"
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.060]   I don't know.
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:12.900]   But let me suggest that sadly many Christians, we think of the 50 to 80 years or so we live
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:13.900]   on this planet.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:21.740]   But when was the last time you asked yourself, "What will I be doing 10,000 years from now?"
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:27.740]   We really don't have an eternal perspective as much as we desire.
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:33.220]   Thomas Watson said, "The world is but a great inn where we are to stay a night or two and
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:34.780]   be gone.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:43.180]   What madness is it so to set our heart upon the inn as to forget our home?"
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:48.060]   Jesus says it better in John 14, "In my Father's house are many rooms.
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:52.900]   If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:57.300]   And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:03.260]   that where I am, you may be also."
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.620]   Adoption is an opportunity to see God's provision.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:10.380]   As a pastor of a small church at the time, we qualified, at least in the county's eyes,
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.960]   for very low income.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:19.740]   So it was a stewardship of no retirement plan, cheap vacations, no music lessons, no martial
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:27.300]   arts, no sports teams for our kids, which there are times I felt guilty not able to
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.580]   provide like their peers.
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:33.220]   But we never went hungry or into debt.
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:36.620]   We just adjusted our lifestyle.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:40.100]   Jesus said, "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:42.140]   given to you as well."
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:45.020]   We don't need stuff or success.
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:49.300]   What we all need is more of Christ.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.300]   More of Christ.
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:56.420]   I don't think my children are missing out on anything due to our choices.
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:04.460]   Maybe dad's sinful choices, but not that.
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:12.020]   Adoption is a great opportunity to be sanctified and see our children and our church encouraged
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:15.380]   and have our joy multiplied.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.380]   It's not the only way.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:22.220]   I want to emphasize adoption is not the only way we glorify God.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:29.500]   We will all be doing different ministries and God will lay on our hearts different things.
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.180]   But I do want to speak to adoption in particular.
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:36.660]   Some will object, "Well, some adopted kids can be very difficult and sinful to deal with."
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.020]   Me too.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:41.660]   You too, right?
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.820]   Grace of God is sufficient to deal with that powerfully.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:46.820]   Watch Him.
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:49.820]   "Well, I don't know if I should or can adopt."
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:54.020]   Yeah, that very well be true.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:58.380]   But you can support those who do if God lays it on your heart.
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:02.620]   "Well, I won't know their medical history and potential health issues."
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.140]   You don't know that with your birth children.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:05.140]   You're not God.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:09.140]   Are you going to stop loving them if they do have health problems later on?
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:12.820]   Are you going to disown them or pull the plug because they get paralyzed in a car accident
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:16.500]   or suffer from Lou Gehrig's disease one day?
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.020]   I hope not.
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:22.540]   I don't think so.
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:30.180]   Your maladies and mine, our radical depravity in the womb and out of the womb are far worse.
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:35.940]   Yet God adopted you to Himself.
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.660]   Someone is to seek suffering just because.
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.260]   We're not masochists.
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:43.020]   Yet we must hate our sin more than our suffering.
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.460]   We must hate our sin more than our suffering.
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:49.660]   Over and over again in Israel's history, if you look at the Old Testament, the Father's
[00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:57.000]   heart is revealed repeatedly for orphans and widows, the fatherless, the broken, the poor.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.100]   And their open neglect was judged by God as the prophets spoke against the social injustice
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:11.860]   at the time as being perpetuated by His very people.
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:19.220]   In Rome they put unwanted babies on the city walls to either die or be taken away as slaves.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:24.140]   And it was the early church who counter-culturally rescued them.
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:30.380]   Speaking to foster adoption just for a moment, the statistic I heard is if less than half
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:37.460]   a percent of our nation's evangelical families adopted one child, then we would empty the
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:40.300]   foster system.
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:47.020]   Let me be clear though, this is not about the social cause of adoption.
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.660]   It's not about the cause of adoption.
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:50.940]   I mean, there are many good causes.
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:57.580]   A lot of times those causes can devolve into something that has nothing to do with Christ
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:01.380]   and the gospel.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:06.140]   Becomes an end in of itself.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.820]   This is not about the social cause of adoption.
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:09.940]   Why?
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.880]   Because doing church and making disciples, they are not the same thing.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:17.700]   Doing church and making disciples are not the same thing.
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:18.700]   Are you making disciples?
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:23.580]   I'm not asking is the church making disciples, are you making disciples?
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.020]   Are you investing and pouring into someone else?
[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.820]   Are you being invested in?
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.520]   We're seeking that out.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.380]   We need each other.
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:39.980]   Many people can adopt, but not all do so for Christ's glory.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.660]   As much as I'm encouraging some of us to do so, it is ultimately about whether or not
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:48.260]   the love of Christ controls your entire life.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.260]   That's the question.
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:51.900]   It's not, the question is not will you adopt?
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:55.140]   The question is does the love of Christ compel you?
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.740]   Does it control your entire life?
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:03.540]   Every nook and cranny of your daily life and future.
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.540]   It's about self-denial.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:09.500]   Jesus said, "Take up my cross daily and follow me."
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.900]   It's about self-denial, all that God might call you to.
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:16.420]   Jesus is our example for how we should then live our daily life in love of the Father.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:20.740]   John 10, 15, "Even as the Father knows me and I know the Father," Jesus says, "I lay
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:23.460]   down my life for the sheep."
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:29.140]   Luke 22, 42, "In that dark moment, Jesus prays, 'Father, if you are willing, remove
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:36.340]   this cup from me, yet not my will, but yours be done.'"
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:43.380]   Our own adoption is the gospel at its most beautiful, most endearing, and most gripping.
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:48.460]   Before I became a dad, I felt conviction of sin when I snapped at someone, but I never
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:53.300]   felt as bad as when I do that with my wife or kids.
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:58.540]   I feel compassion for kids who eat lunch alone at school, but thinking about that happening
[00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:02.940]   to any one of my kids makes me cry in private.
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:08.260]   Yet that doesn't even come close to comparing to our Father's love.
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:11.780]   He's a perfect Father.
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:15.060]   I'm an imperfect one.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:18.620]   He will never give into sinful anger or graceless condemnation.
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:24.220]   His love outclasses any other by his invincible power, infinite omniscience, eternal omnipresence,
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:29.140]   so that we should repent immediately forever, having been anxious or worried or having complained
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:32.460]   about anything.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:41.660]   And yet the good news is that He will never disown us, never forget us, never stop loving
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:47.220]   us, never lose us in a busy mall.
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:51.980]   Luke 15, familiar text reads, "But while he was still a long way off, his father saw
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:57.100]   him and felt compassion for him and ran and embraced him and kissed him.
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:00.500]   The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight.
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.540]   I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:10.620]   'But,' the father said to his slaves, 'quickly bring the best robe and put it on him.
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:14.260]   Put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet and bring the fattened calf.
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:18.780]   Fill it and let us eat and celebrate, for the son of mine was dead and has come to life
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:19.780]   again.
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:22.220]   He was lost and has been found.'
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:26.700]   And they began to celebrate."
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:33.420]   God's children more than any other people on this planet should both know and feel the
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:39.620]   desperate need and life-changing joy of adoption.
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:44.300]   Dear brothers and sisters, do we not know the joy of adoption better than anyone on
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.300]   this planet?
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.940]   Amen?
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:51.940]   Let's pray.
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:59.740]   Father, we know that this is not adoption, the only issue or ministry that we can be
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:00.740]   engaged in.
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:13.500]   It is one of many that need to be saturated, not by legalistic moralism, not by self-righteous
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:21.900]   aims of justice.
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:27.740]   We don't want justice, we want mercy.
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:32.380]   You are the judge, you will bring justice one day.
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:40.340]   But what this world needs is mercy, needs the gospel.
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:46.940]   Thank you for this wonderful church and all that you are doing here, so encouraged by
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.760]   this body.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:57.860]   Pray that our hearts' focus would be that we are living sacrifices.
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:06.660]   And as your adopted children, I pray that your people here, your children here, and
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:13.720]   all the children around the world of you will enjoy the warmth of the sunshine of thy smile
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.840]   this week and forevermore.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.520]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
