[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.400]   We thank you for the proofs that we have to come and study your word.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.640]   We pray Lord God that you would give us refreshment.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.280]   I know that a lot of brothers and sisters in this room have come from a long week
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.560]   of working and maybe studying and need Lord God to meet and
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.800]   to be reminded of your grace and love and why we move and live and have our being in you.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.560]   We pray that your word would not just be just empty words, but
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.080]   that we would be able to hear your voice, that we would understand your heart.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.400]   And that we may find our comfort Lord God knowing that you are a God who is gracious
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.680]   and loving, that you are consistent, that you're somebody that we can put our hope in,
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.160]   in all things.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160]   So we pray Father that you would search our hearts.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.920]   And again, if our brothers and sisters here are in need Lord God of
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.280]   just a reminder of your love toward us.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.680]   I pray that this evening would serve that purpose.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.040]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.840]   All right, so let's look at Isaiah 28 and 29.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.760]   Again, within the larger context of end times judgment.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.840]   And so as we get closer and closer to chapter 40,
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.240]   you'll see that there is gonna be an increase in mention of the coming Messiah.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.120]   So the whole thing that we see all the way to chapter 39,
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.120]   the theme is Israel who is deserving of judgment.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.160]   And along with that all the other nations that are tied up with that, right?
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.400]   So we have the similar judgment.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.280]   But the end part of what we're dealing with, all the way up to chapter 39,
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.240]   is again, not just only talking about,
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.080]   there are some specific historical things that are taking place.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.920]   But there's a lot of language that are very similar to the book of Revelation.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.440]   And I've been trying to point that out as much as I can as we're going.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.760]   But again, we're in that section, first chapter 20 to 29.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.480]   So let's just jump into it, okay?
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.440]   So, upon what and whom does Isaiah pronounce woe in chapter 28?
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.560]   I know that, how many of you guys use ESV?
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.080]   Okay, how many of you guys don't use ESV?
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.400]   Say it loud, say it proud.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.000]   Okay, I don't even.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.200]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.440]   >> Okay, so what do you use?
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.240]   >> Message.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.560]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.200]   >> Huh?
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.160]   What do you use, James?
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.120]   >> NIV and ESV.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.960]   >> And ESV?
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.960]   >> Okay, what do you use, James?
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.680]   >> NASV.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.920]   >> NASV?
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.360]   NASV?
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.760]   No more?
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.520]   ESV?
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.640]   Okay, how many of you guys use NASV?
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.440]   How many of you guys use NIV?
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.920]   How many of you guys use something not ESV, not NASV, not, what did I miss, NASV?
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.520]   Okay, so just kind of different place.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.760]   All right, so most of you guys use ESV.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.120]   All right, so this question when I asked you about the woe,
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.680]   you probably had some, like, okay, well, where is this woe, right?
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.320]   Actually, the word that is translated in the ESV, ah, if you look at the NIV,
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.680]   I think the NASV has that too, right, in some parts where it's translated woe.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.760]   That's basically what it is.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.560]   It's woe as in like, wait a second, take a look, and
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.280]   it is a pronouncement of judgment coming.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.800]   And so, NAS, ESV, for whatever the reason, has decided to translate it, ah.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.400]   So if you look at these texts, there's six different places in the next four or
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.680]   five chapters where the word woe just appears.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.040]   And it kind of connects the section together.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.800]   So it's meant to be understood together because of these woes that
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.600]   connect them together, okay?
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.480]   So I think most of you who guys just using the ESV probably had a hard time,
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.360]   it's like, what woe is he referring to?
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.560]   That's what we're referring to, okay?
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.040]   What is the main pronouncement of judgment against Ephraim?
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.280]   It says, because they become proud, right?
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.440]   It's the way that he says it.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.920]   He says, woe, the proud crown of the drunkard of Ephraim.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.400]   So you get the kind of sarcasm in the way that he describes their sin, right?
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   Their pride is in their drunkenness, right?
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.280]   So in other words, instead of being ashamed,
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.760]   you're glorying in something that you should really be ashamed about, right?
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.600]   And said, because of that, God's gonna bring judgment.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.880]   The Lord has one who is mighty and strong, and a storm overflowing.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.360]   So you'll see in between as there is pronouncement of judgment,
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.640]   there's also pronouncement of the Messiah.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.120]   And again, as I mentioned before, the closer we get to the chapter 40,
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.280]   you're gonna see that the theme where right now it's predominantly judgment and
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.720]   Messiah's coming.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.160]   And then starting from 40 and on, you're gonna see a greater emphasis on
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.280]   the Messiah coming in the midst of judgment, okay?
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.680]   So there's gonna be a subtle change, and we see more of that.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.440]   So in between here, he says, behold, the Lord has one who is mighty and strong.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.760]   So who's the one he's referring to?
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.320]   It's pretty obvious, right?
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.000]   He's talking about the Messiah.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.240]   Judgment is coming because of your stubbornness, because of your pride and
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.120]   drunkenness.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.960]   But the Lord has one who's going to come, and he's going to bring judgment.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.560]   All right, the next verses, verses one through four, again,
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.960]   it is a detailed description of how they became proud over their external beauty,
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.320]   right, the things that they had, but how it's going to be fading, right?
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.800]   Verse one talks about their like fading flowers, comes and goes, right?
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.320]   We see that language in the New Testament, right?
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.320]   That all man fades like this flower, but the word of God lasts forever.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.200]   Again, the proud crown of the drunkard will be trodden underfoot, and
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.440]   these are all description of Ephraim, right?
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:53.680]   Their beauty is attractive, but here, one day gone the other, it's only temporary.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.440]   So whatever is the source of your pride that's causing you to be arrogant before
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.800]   God and disobey, he said it's only here for a minute, it's like a fading flower,
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.640]   right?
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.320]   It's beautiful one day, and it's withered the next day, right?
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.280]   And that's the condition of man.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.920]   Everything that we're tempted by, right, in time, it fades, it's nothing.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.360]   So if you really think about it,
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.360]   think about the things that you desired so much when you were younger, right?
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.240]   In high school, that pants you wanted, you know what I mean?
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.040]   That car that you thought was like, if I just had that car, and
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.920]   think how outdated it is now, right?
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.720]   That sunglass you wanted, think how, think all these things that like at that time,
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.960]   that's gripped your heart, but when you look back at it now, how foolish it is.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.400]   So when you think about it like that,
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.120]   think about all the things that grip our heart today, and
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.080]   it's just a matter of time, right?
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.680]   And that's just a fact.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.400]   So how much we are entangled with things that are temporary, and so
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.760]   that's what he's saying.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.040]   E-frame chased after superficial booty, not booty, beauty, sorry.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.040]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:05.520]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.200]   >> They were judged for that too, right?
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.520]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.020]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.640]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.640]   >> I erased that part,
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.440]   I erased that part.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.160]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.680]   >> All right.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.800]   Pay attention to the vibe.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.440]   >> So for whom would the Lord be a
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.000]   crown of glory and diadem?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.240]   So again, every time there's a pronouncement of judgment,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.720]   he always talks about restoration.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.280]   But is the restoration for everybody?
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.920]   No, it's for the few, for the remnants, right?
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.000]   These are the people who end up repenting and returning to the Lord, and
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.800]   it is not everybody.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.360]   So he's not saying all the people who are experiencing judgment,
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.960]   that all of a sudden God's gonna turn this around.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.200]   He said that because of the judgment, he's going to prune the nation of Israel,
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.000]   and the ones who return and repent, there is a promise of glory, right?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.040]   So the Lord of Hosts will be a crown of glory to the remnant of his people.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.400]   In other words, God's people will not run to shallow beauty, but
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.560]   only to true beauty in Christ.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.960]   After the judgment period is over, right, there's gonna be a period of
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.880]   the remnant who are returning to God who's going to experience this.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.880]   Okay?
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.680]   And then if you look at verse six, again, when this happens,
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.760]   one of the judgments against Israel is, in that day, verse five, that the Lord of
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.960]   hosts will be a crown of glory and diadem of beauty to remnant of his people.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.920]   And a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.880]   And strength to those who turn back and battle at the gate, right?
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.720]   So again, he's saying that the only one that can carry out true justice
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.000]   is Christ who comes, right, the Holy One of God.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:57.280]   So what caused the people, including their religious leaders, to err?
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.600]   So again, the next few verses, verses nine through 13, I think it's nine through seven,
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.880]   and seven through 13, is a description of the sin of the leaders of Israel.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.960]   And they go into pretty detail, right?
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.920]   The leaders are drunk with the world and
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.960]   are not able to give sound judgment, verse seven.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.360]   These also reel with wine and stagger with strong drink.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.200]   The priests and the prophets reel with strong drink.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.880]   They are swallowed by wine.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.520]   They stagger from strong drink.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.500]   They reel in vision.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.760]   They stumble in giving judgment, right?
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.520]   In other words, they're so drunk, and again, it could be literal drunk,
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.680]   being drunk, but also spiritually, they're just not sober.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.680]   And as a result of that, they don't hear the word of God, right?
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.360]   And they're not able to make sound judgment, and
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.440]   they're not able to give sound advice.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.760]   And that's basically what it's saying.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.280]   So the leaders are not able to lead because they're drunk with the world.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:53.800]   And so what they're saying is that what they were doing in private,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.200]   in other words, being drunk and
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.480]   being carried away, is gonna affect their ministry.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.080]   They're not gonna be able to lead the people.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.600]   And then, verses nine through 13, he goes into detail, right?
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.360]   Verse eight says, for all tables are full of filthy vomit with no space left.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:19.320]   And then, if you look at verse ten and on, it says, for
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.440]   it's precepts upon precepts upon precepts, line upon line upon line,
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.800]   here little, there little.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.960]   What do you think that's in reference to?
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:32.440]   For by people of strange lips and with foreign tongues,
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.280]   the Lord will speak to this people to whom he has said.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.680]   So one, who is God speaking to about this?
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.800]   Israel.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.600]   Specifically, who is he pointing out?
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.880]   Who is this in reference to?
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.160]   The leaders.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.680]   So when they say their teaching is but precepts upon precepts upon precepts upon
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.920]   precepts, line upon line upon line upon line, a little here, a little there.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.800]   What is that in reference to?
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:07.640]   I already put it up here, right?
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.520]   They only teach basic and
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.760]   shallow things in repetition over and over again because they're staggering,
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.160]   they're drunk, they're not able to make sound judgment.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.800]   So even their teaching is very shallow, right?
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.920]   And he says, in the end, for by people of strange lips with foreign tongue,
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.600]   the Lord will speak to this people to whom he has said.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.320]   Anybody remember, again,
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.440]   a particular passage in the New Testament that says something similar to this?
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.320]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.120]   >> Yes, could be.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.040]   The period of the Gentiles.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.960]   Remember the Roman chapter 9 through 11 talks about that?
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.920]   That Israel has experienced a partial hardening of the heart, right?
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.160]   Until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.280]   So again, it says something similar, that now the Gentiles are leading and
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.960]   God is using the Gentiles, so the period of the church is a period of the Gentiles.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.680]   Right?
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.520]   And then so because they wouldn't listen to God through the prophets,
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.640]   people of strange lips like foreigners, Gentiles are gonna come and
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.680]   they're gonna end up teaching you instead of you teaching them.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.760]   That's what he's saying, right?
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:18.160]   This is rest, give rest to the weary, and this is repose, yet they would not hear.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.800]   In other words, God gave these things so that you would be an avenue.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.040]   He said, I will bless you, and through you, many others will be blessed.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.520]   But instead of, because you rebelled against God, the Gentiles are gonna come
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.800]   in and they're gonna do what I called you to do, right?
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.440]   The church is going to carry out what I called you to do, basically, right?
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.680]   And the world, verse 13, and the word of the Lord will be to them,
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.880]   precepts upon precepts upon precepts, and upon line upon line, upon here little,
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.480]   there little, that they may go and fall backward and broken and snared and
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.920]   taken, right?
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.600]   So if you look at verse 9, to whom will he teach knowledge and
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.320]   to whom will he explain the message?
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.960]   Those who are weaned from the milk, those taken from the breast.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.400]   In other words, right, their teaching is so shallow that only people that
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.920]   are able to listen and get anything out of it are infants, right?
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.480]   Because they're not able to teach, they're so drunk with the world.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.720]   So all of this, again, is a rebuke that there's a shallowness of the teaching
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.240]   that's causing them, not only them, but the nation of Israel to stray away from God.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.400]   Right?
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:27.840]   And then the Gentiles that they basically hate are gonna be the ones
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.560]   who are gonna be leading.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:35.000]   And that was, if you look at the early church, the biggest problem in the early
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.160]   church was that Jews could not accept the Gentiles into the church, right?
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.120]   They said, you need to submit to us.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.800]   But what God was doing was flipping the table completely upside down, right?
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.240]   It started with the Jews, but eventually, after they get out of the first century,
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.600]   it wasn't the Jews who were carrying the church, it was completely the Gentiles.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.100]   Right?
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:02.720]   When he says, made a covenant, who did he make the covenant?
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.480]   What were they hoping to escape?
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.560]   Right?
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.840]   The rulers of Jerusalem made a covenant with death,
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.320]   meaning that they have no idea that their covenant with other pagan nations for
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.440]   protection was really a covenant with death.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.240]   They have made lies their refuge and in falsehood their shelter.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.040]   So verse 14 and 15, it says, therefore hear the word of the Lord,
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.560]   you scoffers who ruled his people in Jerusalem, because you have said,
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.040]   we have made a covenant with death and with Sheol, we have an agreement.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.800]   When the overwhelming will pass us through, it will not come to us.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.880]   So obviously, they didn't make an actual covenant with death, right?
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.240]   It's kind of a hyperbole that not realizing that the things that you
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.400]   are holding on to is actually a covenant with death.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.680]   In other words, the covenant you made with Egypt,
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.960]   the covenant you made with Assyria and to Babylon,
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.440]   is ultimately gonna lead to a covenant of death, right?
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.560]   A covenant that you made with the world, right?
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.080]   I'm gonna follow your pattern, and ultimately is a pattern of death.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.480]   But that's basically what he's saying.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:10.440]   And so as a result of that, what will the Lord lay in Zion?
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.760]   Who would therefore not act hastily?
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:17.760]   He said, Lord,
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:25.240]   I laid a sure father unlike what Israel was relying on.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.040]   So in other words, the covenant of death that you've made with all these other
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.280]   nations, thinking that somehow you're gonna find life, right?
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.200]   And that's why they made a covenant with Egypt.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.400]   That's why they made a covenant with Babylon.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.800]   You will give you so much and you guys protect us.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.720]   But in your thinking of seeking life,
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.440]   ultimately the reality is you're actually seeking death.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.560]   But he says, but the Lord is going to come.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.920]   Even in the midst of this judgment, he has a promise of the Messiah who's going to
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:00.000]   come, and the foundation he's going to lay is gonna actually lead to life, right?
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.600]   So all these words, the tested stone, the precious cornerstone,
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.200]   the sure foundation, all descriptions of the Messiah.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.920]   And if you look at the language in verse 16,
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.640]   I mean it's pretty clear that this is in reference to Christ, right?
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.480]   Therefore that says the Lord God, behold, I am the one who has laid as
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.440]   a foundation in Zion, a stone, a tested stone,
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.880]   a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.280]   Whoever believes will not be in haste, like what we talked about on Sunday, right?
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.560]   The path to salvation he talks about is to believe, right?
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   And then he says that again in verse 18, right?
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.240]   The covenant with death will then be annulled for those who believe, verse 18.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.800]   Then your covenant with death will be annulled and
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.200]   your agreement with Sheol will not stand.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.360]   So clearly this is in reference to the gospel, right?
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.040]   But despite all of this, despite you turning against God and
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.240]   seeking after these, when the judgment comes and you choose to return and
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.680]   you recognize the Messiah, right, and you repent and you believe,
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:14.880]   he says the covenant of death will be annulled, John 5, 24, right?
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.000]   [COUGH]
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.880]   But when this judgment comes, verse 20, for
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.480]   the bed is too short to stretch oneself on.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.640]   In other words, there's no rest, right?
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.320]   That his judgment is gonna, oops, sorry.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.440]   His judgment is gonna be so thorough, there's no rest, right?
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.000]   But here's something he says, for the Lord will rise up on Mount Perizim,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.280]   as in the valley of Gibeon, he will be roused to do his deeds.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:47.920]   Strange is his deed, and to work his work, alien is his work, okay?
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.680]   I want you guys to take a minute to discuss in your group, what does that mean?
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.560]   Maybe some of you guys took some time to,
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.080]   even though I didn't necessarily ask this question.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.160]   What does that mean, his deeds are strange and his work is alien?
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.880]   Take some time to discuss in your group.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:14.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:24.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:34.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:44.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:54.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:04.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:14.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:24.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:34.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:44.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:54.880]   [INAUDIBLE]

[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:49.240]   All right, what are your thoughts on this?
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:55.960]   Why is he describing the Lord's deed as strange and his work as alien?
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.960]   Any thoughts?
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:19.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:34.960]   So, trying to comprehend why God would judge even his own people,
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.960]   is that what you're saying?
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   Yes.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   Okay.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.960]   Okay, right.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.960]   There's wrong answers, but there's no right answers, right?
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.960]   Just let it percolate, let it sink in.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.960]   All right.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.960]   No, that could, I mean, when we're looking at this passage,
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.960]   could it mean that?
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.960]   Of course, yeah, it could mean that.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   Looking at God's judgment in the context of this,
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.960]   like, what is God doing, right?
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   Why is he, you know, judging his people?
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.960]   That could be it, right?
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.960]   The Jews, I mean, Jews couldn't understand it, right?
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.960]   I mean, it was alien and strange to them.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   Like, why would God judge us?
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.960]   We're the apple of his eye, right?
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.960]   So, that's why when the false prophets came in,
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.960]   remember when Jeremiah kept on saying, like,
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   judgment's coming, judgment's coming?
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.960]   He's like, why would God judge us?
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.960]   We're his people.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   So, in that sense, yes, it was alien.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.960]   It was strange.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.960]   Mm-hmm?
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.960]   >> Question.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.960]   Is his work of judgment a separate work from his work of
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.960]   >> Again, I'm trying to answer the question in the context.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.960]   What do you think?
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.960]   >> Well, because it previously talked about him being the
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.960]   sure cornerstone, the solid foundation,
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.960]   the emphasis is on his belief, but yet there's imminent judgment.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.960]   So, in a way, they seem almost inseparable.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.960]   So, strange and alien as words could mean both of what he
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.960]   referenced as being judgment, being strange and alien,
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.960]   coming from alien, from Gentiles outside of Israel,
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.960]   and strange being not expected, but also the way that Christ
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.960]   came through as Messiah was also strange and alien.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.960]   So, they seem both related and almost inseparable.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.960]   >> Okay.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.960]   So, thinking like a Jew, when he's describing Christ's coming,
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:41.960]   I mean, what is, to a Jew, not a Christian, but to a Jew,
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.960]   what is the strangest passage that they have a hard time
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:53.960]   wrestling with in the Old Testament?
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.960]   You've probably heard it before.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.960]   I know I've mentioned it before.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.960]   Isaiah 53, right?
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   Isaiah 53 is a passage that they don't know what to do with.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.960]   In fact, I mentioned this before.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.960]   I read a whole book on testimony of this Jewish professor.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.960]   He was hiking through Europe, and then it started raining,
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.960]   so he knocked on the door and went in.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.960]   They happened to have a Bible study.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.960]   And so, they were going around reading the Bible,
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.960]   and then they ended up reading Isaiah 53,
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.960]   and he got really offended.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.960]   He said, "You know, I'm a Jew, so don't push that stuff on me."
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.960]   And then he turned around and said,
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.960]   "We're reading the Old Testament."
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   Because he clearly, when he just heard it for the first time,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.960]   he thought, "Oh, this is a Christian Bible study,
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.960]   so you're reading the New Testament."
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.960]   So, when he found out it was the Old Testament,
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.960]   it really rocked his world.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.960]   And we went home and we started examining the text,
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.960]   and sure enough, how could this be anybody else but Jesus?
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.960]   And then he ended up becoming a Christian as a result,
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.960]   and so he wrote a whole book, a testimony about it.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   I mentioned this before.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.960]   Some of you guys probably weren't paying attention.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.960]   [laughter]
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.960]   So, the whole work of Christ, again, I'm not saying that this
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.960]   is the only way we can understand that,
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.960]   but the whole work of Christ is alien, right?
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.960]   In fact, in 1 Peter, remember what it says?
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.960]   When the prophecy came, they were longing to see
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.960]   who and what time this was going to happen,
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   the suffering of Christ, because it was alien.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.960]   Christ's suffering was alien.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.960]   It was so alien, they didn't understand it,
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.960]   even when he came.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.960]   Even his disciples who were with him,
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.960]   even when Jesus said, "I'm going to the cross to suffer
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.960]   and resurrect on the third day,"
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.960]   they couldn't understand it, because it was so alien.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.960]   So, we talk about the substitutionary atonement
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.960]   as what kind of righteousness?
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   Alien righteousness.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.960]   So, it's alien in all these ways.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   It's alien because of the judgment of God.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.960]   It's alien because it's strange.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.960]   It's alien because there's Gentiles who's going to come in
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.960]   and take over.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.960]   The whole prophecy of how this is going to be fulfilled
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   is alien.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.960]   And what's the most alien and strange about all of this
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.960]   is Christ crucified, right?
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.960]   That the Messiah, the King, who's going to come
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.960]   in the order of Melchizedek,
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.960]   King of kings and Lord of lords,
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.960]   he's going to come as a humble servant
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   and then be crucified on the cross?
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.960]   That's strange.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.960]   That's extremely alien.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.960]   So, I don't know what's more strange
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   and what's more alien than the cross itself.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960]   Right?
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   >> Could it be then that God's judgment of some people
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   is meant to be a prototype,
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.960]   sort of to illustrate God's judgment of the Son of the Cross?
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.960]   In that way, both works of their judgment then
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   and God's punishment of Christ for our sins.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   [indistinct]
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.960]   >> I guess we could say that,
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   but the problem is Israel deserves it.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.960]   So that's where that illustration may fall apart.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.960]   Okay.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.960]   It is alien.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.960]   You know, because we hear the Gospel so often
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   and because it's repeated so much in the Church,
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.960]   it doesn't seem alien after a while.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.960]   But the more you dwell on and think about it,
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.960]   when would you ever love somebody like that?
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.960]   Ever.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.960]   You know, even our own children.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.960]   I mean, really, even our own children.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.960]   Like, just pure love.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.960]   Pure love.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.960]   Right?
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.960]   Because we're tainted human beings.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.960]   So, the fact that we think about the God of the universe
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.960]   who loving just speckled us to the point that He went, right?
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.960]   And again, the reason why I think about all of this,
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   and again, I'm not going to go like off tangent.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.960]   I'm very tempted to right now.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:50.960]   But, you know, to me, the Gospel only makes sense
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   if ultimately the cross was to declare His glory.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.960]   Because no matter how much I try to figure out
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:03.960]   why would He die for me?
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.960]   Like, me in particular.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   Right?
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.960]   Now, I know He did, and I know He loves me,
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   so I'm not questioning His love.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.960]   But ultimately, like, it doesn't…
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.960]   The only way that I can make any sense of it
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.960]   is ultimately it was linked to His glory.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.960]   It was His demonstration of who He is.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.960]   Does that make sense?
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:31.960]   He did what He did because that's who He is.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.960]   I was wondering, when it talks about the valley of Gibeon,
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.960]   is there any reference being made to the Gibeonite deception?
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.960]   Because that was when they made a treaty also,
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.960]   and it's kind of a false…
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.960]   No, I think there are definitely historical pointers
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.960]   that he's referencing.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.960]   But because Isaiah is so sporadic in the way that he presents it,
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.960]   like, he'll jump from Assyria to Babylon,
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.960]   to Babylon back to Assyria,
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.960]   it's hard to be definitive historically,
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.960]   because there is no chronological order.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.960]   So, yeah, definitely that could be a reference to that.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.960]   And part of the reason I'm not going too deep into it
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.960]   is because it's not completely certain.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.960]   So if you read, like, four commentaries,
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.960]   they'll all give you kind of different angles of it.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   This is what they think.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.960]   This is what this guy said.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.960]   But in the end, no one's absolutely certain.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.960]   But anyway, I don't have enough time to explain to you
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   some of the thoughts that I have concerning this.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:40.960]   But it makes more sense to me when I put two and two together.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.960]   But for sure, the more I dwell on the cross,
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   the more I don't fully get it.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.960]   Not the teachings of it, but the why of it.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.960]   Like, why? Why would he do that?
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.960]   What does he get out of this?
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.960]   Obviously, it's his glory. He wants our love.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   He wants worship. All of that.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.960]   But Jesus said he could make the rocks to cry out to him.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:11.960]   And we're worse than rocks because we rebel and curse God.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.960]   Anyway, so I think of this, and obviously,
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:20.960]   there's nothing more alien and strange than what God did for us.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.960]   "Whom does Isaiah use to illustrate how God
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.960]   varies his ways of judgment?"
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.960]   Again, so this is in reference to 23 to 29.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.960]   "Does he who gives ear and hear my voice and give attention
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.960]   and hear my speech, does he who plows for sowing plow continually?
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.960]   Does he continually open and harrow his ground?
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.960]   When he has leveled his surface, does he not scatter?"
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.960]   So he's talking about this order of the farmer
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   where he's doing each one of these things,
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   preparing for the next event.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.960]   So he's saying that, again, you see the book of Revelation
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   and how it starts with the bowl, right?
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.960]   No, not the seals, and then the trumpets,
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.960]   and then the bowl judgments, and how each one progressively
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   adds to the other.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.960]   So, again, he's talking about how all of this judgment
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.960]   is not just sporadic boom and he's gone, boom,
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.960]   they're all connected.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.960]   One's leading to the other, and he's doing it systematically.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.960]   And not only is he doing it systematically,
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.960]   in verse 24, 26, he's talking about the varying kinds
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:20.960]   of judgment that's coming.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.960]   And, again, this kind of reminds me of how,
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.960]   even as the judgment is coming, you know how in 2 Thessalonians
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.960]   talking about how Jesus has not come yet,
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.960]   and he said the reason why you shouldn't be disturbed
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.960]   by these false letters that's coming in my name
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:42.960]   is that before Jesus comes, he says, "What's going to happen?"
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.960]   Anybody remember 2 Thessalonians chapter 2?
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.960]   Man of lawlessness is going to be revealed,
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   and then he's going to go into this temple,
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.960]   and he's going to sit in this seat, right?
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.960]   And then he's going to declare to be God, right?
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.960]   And then there's going to be a heavy delusion that's going to come
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:05.960]   so that those who refuse to embrace truth, right?
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.960]   And God's going to allow delusions to come because
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.960]   they willfully rejected God, rejected God,
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.960]   he's going to hand them over.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.960]   So he clearly says there's these things that are going to happen,
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.960]   so when you see these things happening and unfolding,
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.960]   you will know that the end is coming.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   But because it hasn't happened, don't let them fool you
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.960]   saying here he is, there he is.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.960]   So the point of this is pay very close attention, right?
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.960]   So the reason why they were being discouraged is because
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.960]   everything that Christians hope for
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.960]   is linked to his second coming, right?
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.960]   And if you think any other way,
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.960]   it's the health and wealth gospel, right?
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.960]   If our hope in everything that, anything that we're working on
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:50.960]   is hoping that if we invest now, that tomorrow there's going to be a payoff, right?
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.960]   A lot of people invested everything and then died, right?
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.960]   A lot of people invest everything and then they go to prison
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.960]   and their life is cut short and they become poor.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.960]   So for a Christian in the early church,
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.960]   the reason why they were so disturbed was that,
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.960]   remember Satan was, you know, he said all these false prophets are going to come.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.960]   One of the first delusions or the deceptions that came
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.960]   was that no, he already came.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.960]   Because if he already came,
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.960]   it means everything that they've sacrificed to follow Christ,
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.960]   that they missed it, right?
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.960]   And that's why he was writing the second Thessalonians,
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.960]   to assure them this is not the case.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.960]   There's clear things, God does things in order.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   He's not a God of chaos, he does things in order
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:38.960]   and here, you know, pay attention to these things, right?
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.960]   So what does verses 27-20 teach us about the nature of God's judgment?
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.960]   Okay, let's look at 27-28.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.960]   "Dill is not threshed with threshing sledge,
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   nor is the cartwheel rolled over cumin,
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   but dill is beaten out with a stick and cumin with a rod."
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.960]   Right?
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.960]   "Does one crush grain for bread?
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.960]   No, he does not thresh it forever.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.960]   When he drives his cartwheel over it with his horses,
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.960]   he does not crush it."
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.960]   This image was so…
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.960]   Anybody here that went to India?
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.960]   Okay, so remember when we were driving?
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.960]   I think you were in the car with us.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.960]   We would drive and then these people would have all this stuff on the ground
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   and the cars would go over it.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   Remember that?
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.960]   Doesn't that kind of remind you of that?
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.960]   Right?
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.960]   He said all the horses, cars would go over it, but they're not crushed.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.960]   So, initially, you know, when we would go to the countryside,
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.960]   all the farmers would take…
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.960]   What was it that they put on the ground?
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.960]   What was it?
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.960]   Yeah, maybe it was…
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   Yeah, I think it was wheat.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.960]   And they would spread it on the roadside,
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.960]   and then when the cars come, you have to go over it.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:43.960]   Right?
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.960]   So, every time we go over it, we're thinking,
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.960]   "Man, this is going to puncture the car tires."
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.960]   And it's everywhere.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.960]   So, when we didn't understand it, we thought like,
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.960]   "What are these people doing?
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.960]   And why aren't the drivers getting mad?"
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.960]   And realized the reason why they're doing that is because
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.960]   that's the easiest way to get the grain out.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.960]   So, they want a heavy cart to go over it,
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.960]   and every time it does that, it shakes it up, and then it loosens.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.960]   Then they go and pick it up, and then they re-send it back.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.960]   Right?
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.960]   So, that's the image that we see here.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.960]   We're saying, "When they're crushed, what was the purpose of…"
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.960]   So, we were thinking like, "We're destroying it,
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.960]   and they're playing tricks on us," or whatever.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.960]   They're too lazy to get it off the street.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.960]   Not realizing that that was part of their technique to get the wheat out.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   Right?
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.960]   And so, that's the image that's given here.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.960]   It says, "God is crushing, but the ultimate purpose for His people
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.960]   is not to be crushed."
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.960]   It's like, "God doesn't treat you like the pagan nations."
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:35.960]   Right?
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.960]   "He's disciplining His people, because the end result is
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.960]   He's trying to separate the wheat and the chaff."
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.960]   Right?
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.960]   "He's actually going to cause them to bear more fruit at the end
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.960]   as a result of His judgment."
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.960]   "His intent is pruning more than destruction."
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.960]   Right?
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:36:05.960]   That's what he's saying in that text.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.960]   What will happen to Ariel?
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.960]   I put Jerusalem.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:16.960]   Ariel is a code name for Jerusalem, and it means "lion of God."
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.960]   Okay, I think I… yeah.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.960]   Compound word, "ari" meaning "lion," "el" meaning "God."
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:33.960]   "Lion of God."
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.960]   He said, "What would happen to those nations who fight against God?"
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.960]   So, first section of chapter 29 is a description of God's anger
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.960]   because of their pride, and how God's going to humble them.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.960]   Right?
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.960]   Verses 1 through, I think, 4 or 5.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.960]   And then he says, "Even though they're being judged,
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   and God may allow for a period for Assyria and Egypt and Babylonians
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.960]   to come and bring judgment upon them,
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.960]   He said, "Anybody who brings judgment upon them and comes against them,
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.960]   eventually God's going to come and protect them."
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.960]   Right?
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.960]   So, if you look at verse 7 and 8.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.960]   Okay, chapter 29, verse 7 and 8.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.960]   "And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.960]   all that fight against her and her stronghold and distress her,
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.960]   shall be like a dream, a vision of the night,
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:26.960]   as when a hungry man dreams he is eating and awakes with his hunger not satisfied.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.960]   Or as when a thirsty man dreams he is drinking and awakes faint
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.960]   with his thirst not quenched.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:36.960]   So shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion."
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.960]   What does that mean?
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:47.960]   Why is the foreign nations trying to come against Israel like a dream?
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:56.960]   And it's like a hungry man who dreams and wakes up hungry.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.960]   Anybody?
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:08.960]   [Audience member] Does it kind of go back to the judgment of Assyria
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.960]   where they started invading and they got--
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.960]   obviously God's on our side because we destroyed them.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.960]   And so we're the good people, but God's like, "No, you're just a tool.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.960]   You're not really--now I'm going to crush you because you don't care."
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   Is it kind of the same thing?
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   [Audience member] What they see as victory is really God just setting them up for judgment.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.960]   Right. So it was just wishful thinking.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.960]   You're hungry and you want to eat, but then you wake up and it was all just a thought.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.960]   It was a dream. It's not a reality.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.960]   So in other words, anybody who comes against you is not going to happen
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.960]   because God is behind them.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:54.960]   Even though God will temporarily allow it to happen for the purpose of pruning in the end,
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.960]   but their power against you is going to be like a dream.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:02.960]   It's just thoughts. It may seem real to you, but you're going to wake up from it
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.960]   and realize it wasn't real.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.960]   You are not the superpower.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:11.960]   And then you're going to realize that there is a God that you don't have any control over.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.960]   So any power in the universe or in human history,
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.960]   no matter how powerful they were, they're gone.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.960]   All the superpowers of today, it's temporary.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.960]   And then when reality hits, you realize that there's only one God.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.960]   King of kings and Lord of lords. So that's what he's referencing.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:36.960]   So they will desire to devolve Ariel, Jerusalem,
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.960]   but as a hungry and thirsty person can only eat and drink as a dream,
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:49.960]   so will their desire to conquer Zion.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.960]   So what caused this blindness?
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:58.960]   Again, he's going back and forth to, "You're my child, but this is what you did,
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.960]   and here's judgments coming."
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.960]   When you look at the language of what God says, it's almost like,
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.960]   if you have children, when you're punishing your kids,
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.960]   you're punishing them, but at the same time, you're trying to remind them,
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.960]   "You're my child and I love you, but I'm going to have to punish you.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.960]   But don't forget that I love you."
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.960]   And you kind of see that language going back and forth.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.960]   He says, "Anybody who comes against you ultimately are going to realize
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.960]   that you're not going to be able to, because I'm behind you."
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.960]   But here comes the judgment.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.960]   He talks about superficial worship in verse 13,
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.960]   which is what he began with, right?
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:44.960]   Chapter 1, very beginning, he outlined why judgment of Israel is coming,
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.960]   and he spends a good chunk of chapter 1 talking about superficial worship.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.960]   Verse 13, "And the Lord said, 'Because these people draw near with their mouth
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.960]   and honor me with their lips while their hearts are far from me,
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.960]   and their fear of me is commandment taught by men.'"
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.960]   That's all it is, right?
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:07.960]   There's no true fear, they're just jumping through the hoops, right?
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:13.960]   So he's not saying, "Yes, some of them went after idols.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:18.960]   A lot of the kings set up high places and false gods and all that stuff."
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.960]   But at the tail end of Israel's history, before the judgment came,
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.960]   they were known for their temple worship,
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.960]   because they weren't fighting anybody in particular.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.960]   They had the temple, right?
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:34.960]   So whether it's Isaiah, Amos, Hosea, Jeremiah,
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.960]   all these prophets are prophesying during a period
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.960]   when they thought their observation of themselves
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.960]   was that God is pleased with us.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.960]   Remember the primary message of the false prophets
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.960]   were God is not angry with you.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.960]   That was the primary message.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.960]   Jeremiah and Isaiah, they're such downers.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.960]   All they do is make you feel guilty.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.960]   We have the message of the Lord.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.960]   God loves you, right?
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.960]   And there's no judgment coming.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   But God says, "All that worship that you are relying on,
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.960]   thinking that somehow that's going to make you safe."
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.960]   He says, "No, God is actually angry with you because you're superficial."
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.960]   And that's exactly during the time of Jesus.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   They were so angry with the Romans, right?
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.960]   Remember, they were Romans, "Ah, they're bothering us.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.960]   They're the ones. They won't let us worship."
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.960]   And then when they, remember when they asked,
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.960]   "Do we give money to the Romans, or do we give it to the temple?"
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.960]   Remember what Jesus said, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.960]   Give to God what is God."
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.960]   He was rebuking them, right?
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.960]   You're worried about the money, but you're not giving to God.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.960]   It's not about the money, right?
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.960]   Even if you don't give it to the Romans, that's not what God desires.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.960]   God desires your worship, and you're not giving God true worship.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.960]   So give to Caesar, Caesar's.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.960]   Give to God, God's.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:57.960]   And you're not doing either, right?
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.960]   Verse 15, right, it says,
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.960]   "Woe, or awe, you who hide deep from the Lord your counsel,
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.960]   whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, 'Who sees us? Who knows us?'"
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:14.960]   God is saying, "God does."
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.960]   And then verse 16,
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.960]   "You turn things upside down.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.960]   Shall the potter be regarded as the clay,
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.960]   that the thing made should say to its maker,
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.960]   'He did not make me,' or the thing formed say of him who formed it,
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.960]   'He has no understanding.'"
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:40.960]   They refuse to acknowledge God.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.960]   And then this is kind of like the summary
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:48.960]   of why judgment and discipline is coming upon the nation of Israel.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.960]   And again, just to take a minute to look at it,
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.960]   it means superficial worship,
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.960]   just going through the motion, attending church,
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.960]   and doing all that, motion.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.960]   If it's not true faith, true worship, right,
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:02.960]   because that's what God desires,
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   people who will worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.960]   Deeds are hidden from the Lord, right?
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.960]   As long as our reputation is good,
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.960]   what's happening in our hearts in private, right,
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.960]   doesn't matter because it's not really pleasing God, right?
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:20.960]   Only person that can feel safe living two separate things
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.960]   are people who are okay with the reputation,
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.960]   but not the reality, right?
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.960]   And that's what they were.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.960]   And in the end, they were, you know, God was not their king, right?
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.960]   So, we're the pot, He's the potter,
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:42.960]   but instead we're trying to mold Him instead of the other way.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:47.960]   So what does the future hold for the house of Jacob, Israel?
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.960]   I just listed, you may have more than this,
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.960]   "They will again bear much fruit," verse 17.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:56.960]   "At the end of pruning," the purpose of pruning is not to destroy,
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.960]   but that the fruit will be more genuine, it will be more full, right?
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.960]   He said, "Deaf shall hear."
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:06.960]   And again, when He says, "Deaf shall hear,"
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.960]   obviously there's a physical component to it, but spiritually.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.960]   People who had no ear to hear, God's going to open their ears
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:13.960]   and they're going to hear.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:18.960]   People who could not see, they're going to see.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:24.960]   In other words, all of this is a description of revival at the end.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.960]   That's exactly what happens.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:29.960]   When revival comes, all of a sudden the Word of God
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.960]   becomes so much sweeter than it was before,
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:36.960]   and you are able to see His grace and love in a deeper way
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:37.960]   that you haven't seen before.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:43.960]   Sometimes God will bring pruning in your life for that very reason.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.960]   Because without the pruning, a lot of times we remain dull of hearing,
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.960]   dull of seeing, but the pruning causes us to be more sensitive
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.960]   to the things of God.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.960]   And then ultimately the meek will find joy in the Lord,
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.960]   and the poor will have reason to exalt Him.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.960]   In other words, the very things that the world is chasing after,
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:08.960]   again remember the beatitudes, every part of that beatitude
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:12.960]   is exactly the opposite of what the world teaches us,
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.960]   what the world is tempting us with.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.960]   And He said, "But when revival comes, it's the meek who will find joy in Him."
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.960]   It's the poor who will be restored.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.960]   And along with that, the ruthless will be punished.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.960]   And then the final result is that Jacob will be restored,
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.960]   Israel will be restored.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:33.960]   Okay.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:42.960]   Okay, so you can take the rest of the time to discuss with your group.
