[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400]   Okay, hello everybody.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.140]   It's good to see all of you.
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.880]   Your beautiful and handsome faces.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.880]   It's seriously one of the highlights.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:33.280]   I think for me, I love Fridays because I think because you guys have just done, I wanted
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.440]   to say you guys have done such a good job of welcoming me and my family too.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.120]   So thank you so much to all of you for welcoming us.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.200]   And you know, Kazee and I were talking about it a few weeks ago, but we were saying Berean
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.760]   already feels like our home church.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.440]   And that's saying something because I was at the old church, my old church for about
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.500]   20 years.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.760]   And so for me to be able to look at this church and feel a deep sense of love already for
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.920]   people and be, feel the love from people too.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.520]   That is something that I really wanted to thank you guys for.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.500]   So thank you so, so much.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.100]   And I hope that as people are constantly filtering in, if you guys kind of just even look around
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.240]   at the people around you, I hope that you and I will become people and a ministry and
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.560]   a church that love each other, not as the world loves, not as all the love that we can
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.320]   muster up with our own strength, not that kind of love, but the love of Christ that
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.800]   would sacrificially give and love without condition.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.020]   And man, it would be so amazing to see Berean be characterized and marked by a Bible preaching,
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.180]   Bible believing church that so believes it, that it works itself out and being one of
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.540]   the most loving churches you can see in Southern California, you know.
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.820]   So let's always be encouraging each other of that.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.340]   I know the end of the school year is coming up and in the beginning of the school year,
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.380]   there's this like drive, right?
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.960]   It's like try to welcome people, but by the end, everyone's just like, okay, let's just
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.440]   survive every man for himself.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.680]   You're like, everyone's like just crawling towards the finish line.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.040]   I'm dying, I'm dying.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.200]   But let's crawl together.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.720]   Let's pull each other up and fight this together and love one another and we could do this
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.720]   together.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.880]   A few announcements here.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.440]   First announcement, college serve month is going to be beginning very soon.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.760]   So please be on the lookout for the Facebook thing that will probably come out sometime
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.760]   in the near future.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.440]   Has it come out yet?
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.440]   It's going to come out tomorrow.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.480]   Okay, here's the thing.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.520]   Now every year that ticks by, I feel like we check Facebook less and less because there
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.000]   are just so many notifications.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.960]   And yet, Berean, we are a church that really utilizes Facebook.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:01.120]   Meaning if you want to serve and try your best to be diligent in looking through at
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.960]   least some of the notifications that kind of matter.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.520]   And can I also say this?
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.760]   Man, you guys are awesome.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.800]   My college ministry I see and I've been hearing is always the first ones to step up and serve
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   and things like that.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.400]   You guys are setting great example to the rest of the church and really serving in love
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.800]   and that's been awesome.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.080]   Let's do even better.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.280]   Let's be people who see it and don't say like, "Oh, I'll respond to it like a day before,
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   a week before."
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.600]   But as soon as it comes out, let's make room in our schedules to say that, "I really want
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.480]   to serve the church in these manners."
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.800]   And so when this thing comes out tomorrow, hopefully it will be inundated with this desire
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.680]   and the signups from 90 collegians who want to serve and love the church in that manner.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.960]   So let's do that together.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.220]   Next one on May 5th, this is Saturday, cross class hangouts is going to be happening.
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.560]   So please keep that marked in your calendars.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.500]   And last one is going to be all church cleanup, which is happening tomorrow from 8.30 to 12.30.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.440]   And then on Sunday from, anyone know from Sunday, 2 to 4?
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.440]   2 to 6?
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.440]   2 to 4?
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.440]   2 to 4 o'clock.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.200]   2 o'clock to 4 o'clock.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.880]   So can I, just for like, just out of my own curiosity, did you guys sign up for the, if
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.200]   you guys signed up for the all church cleanup, can you raise your hand?
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.600]   Okay.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   That's about half of us.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.560]   If the other half, if you guys still want to serve, I think you can just come.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.440]   And then wherever there's need, just kind of fill in.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.440]   So full disclosure, I forgot to sign up.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.800]   So I'm going to be here though.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.480]   And that's such a bad example.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.680]   I'm so sorry.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.640]   But I think it's going to be a great time.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.720]   I heard about this crazy building project that happened about a year ago where we moved
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.560]   from the Airway campus to here.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.040]   I was not a part of it.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.400]   So when I look around this church, I'm like, wow, this is a nice church.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.160]   But when like Pastor Peter and Pastor Mark tell stories about it, I'm like, whoa, you
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.480]   guys went through all that?
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.280]   And they have like this camaraderie.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.320]   And I feel like I'm this outsider looking in.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.320]   I'm like, wah, wah.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.760]   I'm so sad.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.080]   But like there's this desire.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.400]   It's like, man, I wish I was a part of that.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.280]   And there's a part of it where when you get involved and you're cleaning and even tonight,
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.080]   I don't know if you guys saw, but there was an announcement made to the church saying,
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.400]   hey, is there anyone that could help us put like set up the security cameras around the
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.840]   church and things like that?
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.120]   If you're able, was that not put up?
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.400]   Okay, maybe that's not for the general public.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.680]   Oh, okay, okay, you guys saw it.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.680]   Okay.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.240]   So like when things like that come out, like let's really try to be a part of these types
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.320]   of things because I believe that sometimes simply through service to the church, your
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.520]   love for the church really does grow.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.120]   And it's kind of a cool thing to see.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.120]   That's by the way, this is a side note, if you're struggling in faith, if you're like
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.400]   you're beginning to feel the tinge of apathy, you know, and just things aren't as, you feel
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.480]   like it's not as exciting as it used to be.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.920]   You know, the worst thing you could do is sit down and wallow in that.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.480]   And one of the better things you could do while you're doing all the right things is
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.840]   go out and serve, go out and love, go out and say that I am going to choose to be a
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.220]   part of the body and encourage others and in that you will be encouraged.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.880]   So that was that.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:45.560]   Now, as we were singing that last song, I was kind of thinking through, even just theologically,
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:53.080]   and as we're coming to this understanding of what it means to come and behold Him.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.920]   Why do we sing that?
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:01.200]   What is the purpose of beholding God?
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:09.880]   And it came to my mind because I was talking to someone this week who was saying that they
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.640]   were having a hard time reading Scripture.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:17.080]   It just wasn't so sweet these days.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.400]   And as we were talking, one of the questions I asked this person was, you know, like what
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.800]   is the point of Scripture?
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.360]   Why is it that we're commanded to read it?
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.280]   And what is it about Scripture that changes our hearts?
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.160]   And the answer was telling.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.640]   And this was actually one of my old church members, and we're just catching up via Facebook
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.640]   and stuff.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.000]   And what they said was striking.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.440]   And I think it's striking because I myself fall into this.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:53.000]   It's because they said it's because it tells God's commandments, what He wants of us.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.520]   And as I was thinking about that, I was like, man, is that the first thing that I think
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.520]   about?
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.720]   And I think so.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.960]   It helps us because it instructs us.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.040]   And there is an element of that.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.920]   But more than that, we have this understanding that even the law of God, though they are
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:15.480]   a list of commandments, what the law of God was supposed to do was to show who God is.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.480]   It's a picture.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.640]   It's drawing a picture of who He is.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.760]   And basically when He says like, you know, do not steal, He's saying do not steal because
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.520]   I am one who does not steal.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.600]   And there's this idea of not just looking to the law, a list of things that are given,
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.500]   but that this is painting a picture, all of scripture is painting a picture of God.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.920]   And scripture itself is causing us to behold Him.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.240]   And that's where worship stems from.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.880]   Not knowing the Christian things to do and the fact that we need to read the Bible at
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.400]   the very least so that when small group goes around, I can say I read the Bible, you know,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.400]   things like that.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.200]   That's not what we're driven by.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.720]   That's not what's going to give us life in scripture.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:03.160]   It's as we read it, we look at it and we're like, oh my gosh.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.840]   And we come to our small group and we're like, dude, let me tell you who God is.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.440]   I found out a little bit more about Him.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.880]   And that's what we're sharing about.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.880]   We're sharing about who He is and how great He is.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.160]   And in that place, you know what's cool?
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.080]   Worship becomes spontaneous.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.280]   It's you just can't keep it in.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.960]   You're like, He is so good.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.920]   And you're driven to pray to God.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.920]   Thank you.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:36.280]   You know, that's when thank you comes out before any of the requests that we have.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.800]   And thank you comes out before any of the venting that we're doing before our God.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.400]   We just have a mindset of, man, the beautiful God that we serve.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:51.280]   So with that said, can we come before this God and realize that we are not praying to
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.280]   open air.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.280]   We're not just thinking words in our minds.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.560]   We are speaking to our God.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.520]   So let's pray together.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:16.280]   Oh God, I sometimes can't believe that you are here in our presence now.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.000]   And that you are listening to us.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.840]   You are so close.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:34.800]   A God so great and one that we proclaim and exalt as majestic and glorious would be so
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800]   close to us.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.040]   And Father, thank you that we can pray in this manner then.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:49.520]   Thank you, God, that sinful people have audience with the King, with the God of the universe.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.640]   God, who are we?
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:06.960]   And Father, in this place, we almost so boldly ask of you, our Father, to give us what we
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.520]   demand of you.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.880]   We demand, God, more of you.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.280]   That we want to know you more.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.860]   That we want to see you in the pages of Scripture.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.920]   That we want it to be something that is beyond studying text.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:30.720]   Father, that as we study, regardless of the skill of the preacher or the teacher, that
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:37.240]   your word would be the way by which the Spirit would illuminate our eyes.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.240]   That the things of this world would not be the things that we consider beautiful and
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.360]   desirable and attractive.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.440]   But Father, all things fade away as shadow.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.560]   And God, we see you.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.880]   So God, thank you that in Revelation we can see this.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.960]   And we pray, Father, that as we leave these Bible studies, always we are exalting you.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   Okay.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:12.040]   Well, Revelation 13, today is going to be a little bit different.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.800]   And my formatting is beginning to, for these worksheets, are beginning to get more and
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.400]   more like just squished together.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.280]   It's getting hard.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.960]   And today, we're going to be doing something a little bit different than we've been doing
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.440]   up until this point.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:35.480]   And the reason is because we have to have a better scriptural understanding of the Antichrist.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.440]   So that's the first thing we're going to be going through today.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.840]   A scriptural run-through of who the Antichrist is.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.280]   Because we've talked about the Antichrist.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:49.440]   And a lot of today's text in chapter 13 is going to be dealing with this Antichrist.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.640]   Before we get into that, though, we have to address discussion question number three from
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.640]   last week.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.600]   Because that was the one I got literally, I think over 15 people came up and asked the
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.600]   same question.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.600]   Okay?
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.480]   Like, how do we discern whether something is of demonic activity or not?
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.940]   And I heard everyone, there were a lot of groups that were arguing, and people broke
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.840]   friendships because of the arguments and stuff.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.840]   You don't have to.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.560]   That was actually a trick question.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.080]   The point of that question was to kind of paint this picture of the fact that we're
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.800]   not supposed to look for demonic activity under every rock.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.280]   So it's not like, you know, I got into a car accident.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.240]   That was a demon.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.560]   You know, it's not like that kind of thing.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:41.500]   However, the idea of this is, is that though we're not able to know for sure whether something
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:46.700]   is of, like, demonic activity or whether this is a test of God or whether it's just a coincidental
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:53.500]   thing, which by the way, we're not going to go into it, but what is coincidence, right?
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.220]   Rather than these kinds of things, we're going to be talking, we're talking about this as
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:05.780]   an idea of having a spiritual lens as to how we see things, broad point of view, in broad
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.960]   strokes.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:13.380]   So when we see things, how quick are we to be vigilant of the fact that we are residing
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.960]   in spiritual warfare?
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.340]   So that is, it's almost like a backdrop, rather than trying to figure out the nitty-gritty.
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.380]   Do you guys understand what I'm saying?
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.940]   So rather than scientifically trying to pick out what was of demonic origin or not, we're
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.180]   saying, as we look at things, we go, "Huh, why did that happen?"
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.820]   You know, or, "Oh, that's interesting.
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.820]   I wonder why."
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:42.940]   You know, we're so quick, especially in the Western world, when something happens, to
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.980]   attribute it to, like, our rationality, right?
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.500]   We're just quick to do that.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:54.100]   And so instead of being so quick to jump into that kind of viewpoint, we want to be prayerfully
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.580]   always on guard.
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.720]   So that's what that means.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.980]   We weren't able to get into Ephesians 5 and 6 last week, but in Ephesians 6, when it's
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:10.740]   talking about the whole armor of God, every armor piece is a defensive armament.
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.880]   Do you guys remember the one offensive piece of armor?
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   The sword.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.300]   And what was the sword?
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.300]   The word.
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.300]   Okay.
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.940]   And that's really telling.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:28.820]   Because in that, if you want to be spiritually keen and aware, and you want to go into battle
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.620]   spiritually, you cannot always be on the defensive.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:36.500]   And the only way to be on the offensive, then, is through the word of God.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:42.300]   So I had a friend who used to do this, and it was, like, the cheesiest thing, but it
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.980]   really worked for me.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.700]   Like, anytime, like, we would...and he got this from one of our, like, Christian heroes
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:55.700]   of the faith, but whenever we would pass each other at UCSD, back in college, he would go,
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.700]   "On guard!"
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.700]   And every time, I'd be like, "Dude, stop!"
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.740]   Oh, man, it was so embarrassing, because people would be around me.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:05.740]   He'd go, "On guard!"
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.300]   And he'd be looking straight at me.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:14.060]   And what he was basically saying is, like, you know, like, "On guard, like, are you ready?"
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.220]   With scripture.
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:21.580]   And so what he had said was, "Whenever I say 'on guard,' think of a memory verse."
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.580]   So he'd say, "On guard!"
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:28.580]   I'd be like, "Oh, dang it, oh, John 3, 6, 7..."
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:36.100]   All that to say, when you guys ask each other, "How has your scripture reading been?"
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.560]   It's not a Christian exercise, you know?
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.540]   It's not just like, "Hey, how have you been doing your scripture reading?"
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.540]   "Just because."
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.660]   Or like, "Oh, I've been doing pretty well."
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.860]   Or like, "Oh, I haven't been doing that well."
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.540]   Or, you know, that's how we tend to react, right?
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:54.100]   But for real, this understanding of we are always in scripture together, meditating on
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.260]   it together, that we will sharpen each other with it.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:01.220]   That if we're talking, rather than saying, like, "Have you been reading?"
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.740]   Ask, "What have you been learning?"
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.780]   And then, if you're the other person, tell them!
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.620]   Tell them what you've been learning!
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:16.780]   So if you've been in John, tell them, "Today, I read John 14, and I learned this."
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.660]   And then, say, even go deeper than that.
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.500]   Go like, "Hey, when did you read that?
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.100]   Was that three weeks ago, or was that today?"
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.860]   Sometimes we'll take one thing we learn, and we'll kind of walk around with it, and then
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.980]   when someone asks you, "What have you been learning?"
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.860]   We'll pull out the one thing from that one day.
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.440]   But rather than that, always be on guard in scripture.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:43.020]   And as we do this, hopefully we can become a ministry and a church that is always on
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.180]   guard.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.060]   That we can pull these things out and push each other.
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.060]   Memorize scripture together.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.980]   Sorry I'm taking so much time right now, but memorize scripture with one another.
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:01.660]   Get together in groups and say, "Hey, do you want to memorize through Philippians chapter
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.660]   2?"
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.100]   And then say, "Yeah, I want to memorize."
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.120]   If you say that to someone, most people are not going to say no.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.200]   If they say no, there's something wrong with them.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.840]   So say, "Hey, do you want to memorize through this together?"
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.520]   And wait for them to say yes.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.120]   And then go through the chapter together.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.240]   Read through it, and then memorize it together.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.440]   These are some of the best things you could do.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.200]   Not just go get boba and things like that, which are cool, but we want to grow in the
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   faith together.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.160]   Anyway, let's talk about the Antichrist.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.280]   A scriptural run through the Antichrist.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:42.840]   Well, if you could turn your Bibles to Daniel chapter 2.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   Please turn there.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.240]   I don't have it up for you.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.720]   So all of Roman numeral 1, you're going to have to flip through scripture with me.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:56.240]   Daniel chapter 2, verse 31.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:04.680]   Now, Revelation, a lot of it, you need to have a firm grip of some of the more eschatological
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:10.680]   texts in the Old Testament, like Daniel, Zechariah, Ezekiel, and so on and so forth.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:18.200]   Daniel is probably one of the most important books you need to know when it comes to Revelation.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.960]   And this is going to provide a backdrop for us as we think about how the church was reading
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:29.280]   the book of Revelation from the time it was written.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.280]   Chapter 2, verse 31.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:35.460]   It says, "You saw, O king, and behold, a great image.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.820]   This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was frightening.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:44.160]   The head of this image was a fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its middle and thighs
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:50.560]   of bronze, its legs of iron, and its feet partly of iron and partly of clay."
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.440]   And then after this, if you continue to read through, all the way through verse 45, you're
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:59.840]   going to see that this stone comes and breaks it down, and that this stone is going to be
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:04.720]   something that becomes a great mountain, if you look at verse 35, and it fills the whole
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   earth.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:11.240]   And this was a dream, right, given to King Nebuchadnezzar, and Daniel is interpreting
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.240]   it for him.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.600]   So if you look at verse 36, it says, "This was the dream.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.520]   Now we will tell you, the king of its interpretation, 'You, O king, the king of kings, to whom
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.920]   the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory, and into
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.720]   whose hands he has given, wherever they dwell, the children of man, the beasts of the fields,
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:32.280]   and the birds of the heavens, making you rule over them all, you are the head of gold.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.680]   Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you, and yet a third kingdom of bronze,
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.840]   which shall rule over all the earth.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.760]   And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, because iron breaks to pieces and
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.480]   shatters all things, and like iron that crushes, it shall break and crush all these.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.920]   And you shall saw the feet and toes partly of potter's clay, and partly of iron, and
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.520]   shall be a divided kingdom.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.160]   But some of the firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.160]   soft clay.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.700]   And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.700]   strong and partly brittle."
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.280]   And it continues.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:08.080]   So there's this image of this statue, and I have it written out for you here.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.600]   We could pass through the intro today.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.800]   Yeah, let's go through this one.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.320]   Oh, man.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.880]   All right, Daniel 2.31 to 4.45, and this is what we see, right?
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.000]   The gold head.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.480]   He says, "This is you, O king."
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.480]   So this is Babylon.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.200]   Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.760]   He's talking about a kingdom that comes after.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.440]   Did you guys see that?
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.480]   What's the kingdom that comes after Babylon?
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.480]   Medo-Persia.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.040]   Okay, so it's Persia, but there was Media and Persia, and it became kind of a unified
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.520]   kingdom.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.080]   And so Medo-Persia, that was the silver chest and arms.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.080]   And he says, "Another kingdom's going to rise after."
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.080]   Do you guys know what that is?
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.080]   Greece.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.520]   Okay, now, hopefully this stuff is starting to stick.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.360]   We've gone through this multiple times.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:56.600]   And lastly, probably the one of most importance for today's study is going to be the legs
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.680]   and the feet and the toes.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.680]   It's going to be Rome.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.400]   Okay, just the iron legs.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   Let's go to the next one.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.760]   Oh, was it not there?
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.760]   There was nothing after the iron.
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.760]   Okay.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.520]   Oh, oh, too bad.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.400]   Well, it's Roman colonies.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.960]   That's your thing there.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.040]   That's the iron clay feet and toes.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.320]   And so this is describing something, that these kingdoms are going to be moving like
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.480]   this, and then finally there's going to be a kingdom that's different than all the kingdoms,
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.600]   and it's this kingdom of Rome.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.640]   So remember, Daniel's written way before.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.600]   This was during the time of Babylon.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.400]   And Daniel was predicting this.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.400]   That's why Babylon is named.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.640]   But Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome are not named.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.640]   Why?
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.440]   Because they have yet to exist.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.720]   This is why a lot of historians do not believe that Daniel was written in the time where
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.920]   it was supposed to have been written, because they say, "There is no way Daniel could have
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.320]   prophesied about these kingdoms."
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.160]   And yet, we know that he did.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:16.960]   And he actually was able to, with great...it was just perfectly prophesied of, of these
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.080]   kingdoms that were to come, and also that this kingdom of Rome is going to be exactly
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.280]   how he describes it.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:29.440]   It's going to be a kingdom where it doesn't absorb and make these other kingdoms become
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   a part of its kingdom, but it would absorb it almost like toes, right?
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.160]   Feet and he's talking about these feet like as these toes, there's 10 toes, that there
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.840]   are going to be these little colonies or little kingdoms that kind of come out of Rome.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:49.160]   And we know that in history because Rome was a kingdom, a power that held that in high
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.280]   regard.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.320]   Any questions about that?
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   Was that clear?
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.320]   Okay.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:00.240]   You guys know a little bit about the history of Rome and how they would colonize rather
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.240]   than absorb?
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:07.040]   They wouldn't conquer and then like, like everybody a part of this nation over here
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.960]   now, they're just Romans.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:15.280]   But they would continue to give their own identity, but they will colonize them in that
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.280]   manner.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.000]   All right, so there's a statue in Daniel chapter 7.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.440]   So can you turn there, verse 3?
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:29.920]   Daniel chapter 7, verse 3 through 8.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.120]   So statue of four parts.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.040]   Now we're going to talk about a dream of four beasts.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.040]   Again four.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.520]   Verse 3, "And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.040]   The first was like a lion and had eagle's wings.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.720]   Then as I looked, its wings were plucked off and it was lifted up from the ground and made
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.960]   to stand on two feet like a man and the mind of a man was given to it.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.680]   And behold, another beast, a second one like a bear.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.960]   It was raised up on one side and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth and it
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.480]   was told, 'Arise, devour much flesh.'
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.720]   After this I looked and behold, another like a leopard with four wings of a bird on its
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   back.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.280]   And the beast had four heads and dominion was given to it.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:09.240]   After this I saw in the night visions and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.360]   and exceedingly strong.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.880]   It had great iron teeth and it devoured and broke in pieces stamped what was left with
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.880]   its feet.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.120]   It was different from all the beasts that were before it and it had ten horns.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.760]   I considered the horns and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one,
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.520]   before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:29.680]   And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things."
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:34.000]   So now four beasts again, the first three are labeled, the fourth one it says is different
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.840]   than the rest.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.200]   And out of this one, ten horns spring out, just like the ten toes that were seen in the
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.320]   statues.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.920]   Now if you swing over to verse 23, he interprets it.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.400]   "Thus he said, 'As for the fourth beast, there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth which
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.200]   shall be different from all the kingdoms.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.380]   It shall devour the whole earth and trample it down and break it to pieces.
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:00.160]   As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom, ten kings shall arise and another shall arise
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.160]   after them.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.960]   He shall be different from the former ones and shall put down three kings.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.240]   He shall speak words against the most high and shall wear out the saints of the most
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.720]   high and shall think to change the times and the law and they shall be given into his hand
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.840]   for a time, times, and half a time.'"
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.400]   And it continues here.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.840]   Things should be like perking up your ears now, right?
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.920]   Interesting, interesting stuff that this kingdom is going to arise and then there's just going
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.960]   to be this one person that comes out of it who is going to speak words against the most
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.600]   high and wear out the saints of the most high.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.920]   Very different than the imagery of the beast, right?
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.320]   He's describing what the beast is.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.320]   It's a kingdom.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.280]   Now he's saying out of this kingdom, a person is going to arise.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:42.160]   So now if he's describing the vision, then this is no longer symbolism, right?
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.120]   So when we're reading the vision itself, we're thinking symbols.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.120]   These aren't actual beasts that are going to arise because later on he says these are
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.320]   kingdoms.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:56.080]   But now when he's describing it again, I'm saying this so you get it, an actual person
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.680]   is going to arise out of this kingdom.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:04.160]   And it says in verse 25, he's going to wear out the saints of the most high for three
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.640]   and a half years, right?
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.520]   That we already learned what that is now.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.520]   Okay.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:17.440]   Now I'll turn to Daniel chapter 9, verse 24.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:23.000]   Verse 24 says, "Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city to finish
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.040]   the transgression, to put an end to sin and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.080]   righteousness, to seal both vision and profit, and to anoint a most holy place.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.880]   Know therefore and understand that from the going out of the word, to restore and build
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.400]   Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one," mark that one in your mind, "a prince, there
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.760]   shall be seven weeks.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.460]   Then for 62 weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time.
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.880]   And after the 62 weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.000]   Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be a war.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.080]   Desolations are decreed," mark that one in your mind, "and he shall make a strong covenant
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.580]   with many for one week."
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.480]   Notice that this is now a person.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.920]   "He shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.320]   shall put an end to sacrifice and offering, and on the wings of abominations shall come
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:19.480]   one who makes desolate until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator."
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.480]   Now you're hearing repeating words now, right?
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.800]   We see desolations are decreed.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.240]   We're seeing he's going to make things desolate.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.640]   And we're seeing also that something's going to be poured out upon the desolator.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.440]   There's going to be abominations during this time.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.560]   And it says these strange numbers, right, these weeks.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.320]   And these are the 70 weeks.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.400]   Now let me explain a little bit of what the 70 weeks are.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.440]   If we go to the next slide.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.080]   So it says that there's going to be, yeah, back to that one.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:52.160]   So it says that there's going to be seven weeks, and then there's going to be 62 weeks,
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.880]   and then there's going to be one week.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:00.080]   Now for the sake of time, we're going to jump past the time in between the seven and 62
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.080]   weeks, okay?
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.240]   And there's a time in between the 62 and one week.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:09.160]   And it says here, if you guys could look down, that between that time, let's see here, it's
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.360]   in verse 26.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:19.680]   After the 62 weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.920]   Now weeks were a way for them to describe years.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.640]   So let me explain this to you.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.600]   One week is seven years.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.920]   Every day being one year.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.600]   This was a common practice.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.440]   So this isn't something you need to like question, okay?
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.960]   This is like, just take my word for this one.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   So then seven weeks is how many years?
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.640]   Seven weeks is how many years?
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.080]   One week is seven years.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.080]   So seven weeks is?
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.080]   49.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.080]   49 years, yeah!
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   Okay, cool.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.520]   You guys could clap for her.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.520]   All right.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.200]   62 weeks then is how many, B?
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:05.160]   Okay, I can't even remember.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.160]   I forgot.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.160]   62 times seven.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.520]   All right, so it's like 400 something years.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.800]   And then it says there's gonna be one week, which is?
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   Seven years.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.240]   Okay, cool.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.080]   So let's do it this way.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.880]   There's going to be 69 years, right?
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:26.800]   If we, I'm sorry, 69 weeks, the first two numbers there.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.840]   And 69 weeks is what, 483?
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.840]   Something like that, 483 years.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   Yes?
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.960]   Everyone with me for now?
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.080]   These numbers are fairly important.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.080]   Everyone with me?
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.080]   Okay.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.200]   And it says after 483 years that the anointed one is gonna be cut off.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.120]   Now who do you guys think the anointed one is?
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.360]   Jesus.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.400]   We don't have the time to go into the timeline of this.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:31:01.000]   But the time when this kind of like this timer is set off is from this part of this time
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.800]   when King Artaxerxes, he decreed.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:13.080]   He made this decree about the, and this was in the time of Medo-Persia when he gave Israel
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:18.080]   the time to rebuild the temple and rebuild the city walls and all these types of things.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.480]   And there was a year that this was set off.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.800]   And about 483 years after that is actually around the time when Jesus Christ was crucified
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.160]   on the cross.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.160]   Which is very interesting.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.240]   Now, that leaves us one week, right?
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.800]   We're like, man, Daniel got it.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.880]   Daniel somehow figured out, and he didn't figure it out, right?
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:46.960]   It was a vision, that 483 years after the time there is going to be a Christ who is
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.560]   cut off, crucified in our case.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.800]   And then this one week is going to be happening.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.200]   And this one week is gonna be a time where it's talking about this abomination, it's
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.560]   talking about these desolations, it's talking about this one guy that's gonna arise.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:05.080]   And for how long is this person going to rule and reign?
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.600]   If you guys look down at the text.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.840]   I'm gonna make you guys look for it.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.780]   Look down.
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:18.560]   How long will this guy kind of have, like not sovereign rule, but like have control?
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:23.080]   It's half the what?
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.400]   Half the seven years, half the week, right?
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.720]   So it's gonna be how many years?
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.560]   Three and a half years.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.680]   Okay now, things are starting to click a little bit, right, as you go through the book of
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.680]   Daniel.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.680]   All right.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:42.160]   Now turn to Daniel chapter 12.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.880]   Now Daniel's concluding his prophetic book here.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.880]   Poor Daniel.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:52.240]   You know, like, just got owned through this book.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.800]   Have you guys ever had like the most intense dream, and you wake up and your whole body
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.120]   is just like shaking and stuff?
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.360]   Poor Daniel, right?
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.000]   Chapter 12, verse 1, it says, "At that time shall arise Michael."
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.280]   Do you guys remember when Michael came out in Revelation?
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.280]   Chapter 12.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.680]   "The great prince who has charge of your people, and there shall be a time of trouble such
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.740]   as never has been since there was a nation till that time.
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:21.240]   But at that time," he's talking about future events, "your people shall be delivered.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.560]   Everyone whose name shall be found written in the book, and many of those who sleep in
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.880]   the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.880]   contempt.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.040]   And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above, and those who
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.960]   turn, many to righteousness like the stars forever and ever.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.440]   But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book until the time of the end.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:46.240]   Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase."
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:52.000]   So he is told, "Shut this book."
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.600]   But we never find out what happens in that last week.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.800]   You're like, "Oh, no, no!"
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.480]   You're like, "Ah, what happened?"
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.760]   And so there is so much debating going on, right?
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.880]   Now do you guys know the intertestamental period, the time between the New Testament
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.840]   and Old Testament, about how long that silent period was?
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.680]   Anyone?
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.160]   If you think you know, just say it out loud.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.160]   70?
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.160]   No.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.160]   About 400.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.160]   Okay, about 400.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:25.800]   Okay, about 400 years of silence.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.320]   We always look through the Old Testament, we think it's written in some kind of chronology
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.240]   or whatever, but it's not.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.240]   So it's not like what happens in the very beginning.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:40.400]   If you ever had a chronological Bible, it will show you exactly when things were written.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:45.640]   So things like what happens in Nehemiah, even though that's found more in the middle of
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:50.400]   the New Testament, that's something that chronologically happens towards the end when things are rebuilt.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:59.240]   And so when Daniel is prophesying this, it is around the time before when God stops speaking
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.120]   to prophets.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.280]   So it is around that time.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:10.600]   And he's told here to shut this book, we never find out what happens about that one week,
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:18.760]   and then we finally get to Revelation, until we find out what he's talking about.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.600]   Now there's a huge gap then, right?
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.600]   There's a huge gap.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.600]   And if you guys are putting two and two together, it's not that hard to understand that this
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:30.360]   last week is the tribulation period that we've been talking about for a while.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.800]   Now what is that gap?
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   Why does God function in this kind of way?
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.040]   It almost doesn't make sense.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.920]   How could a logical God say there's going to be 70 weeks, and then it's like there's
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:48.080]   69, and arbitrarily all this time in between until one day God says that now's the time?
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.760]   Well, think about it.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:58.160]   It says in 2 Peter 3 that to God, a thousand years is what?
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:04.800]   It's like a day, and a day is like a thousand years.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.920]   A thousand years is like a day.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.840]   So for him, time is not anything of that much importance.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.840]   It's something that he uses to help us, but for an eternal God, he sees in a different
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.840]   manner.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.840]   Now think about it.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.760]   God says that the offspring would come to Eve.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.640]   We talked about the offspring last week, the singular offspring.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.680]   And Galatians, Paul told us the answer to that.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.640]   It's going to be the Christ, the Messiah.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.080]   Would come, what did they think?
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.320]   They were looking at the babies they were bearing.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.720]   Like, is this the offspring?
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.920]   Is it going to be Abel?
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.160]   And Abel gets killed, and then, "Oh no, Cain, how could you?
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.040]   You don't want to lose him.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.040]   We're doomed."
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.360]   It could be like that way, but it's not.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:54.120]   And so from there, they're constantly looking for the Messiah for thousands of years.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.960]   They're like, "What is this?
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.240]   God, how can you say that the offspring is going to come?
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.360]   Eve, you're going to bear an offspring?"
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.120]   And then finally, thousands and thousands and thousands of years later, we get to this
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:10.000]   point, and it's like, "Oh, there's Jesus."
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.640]   So God functions in this manner.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:17.200]   In Galatians 4, verse 4, it actually says something about the gospel, about when Jesus
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.200]   is going to be born.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.480]   It says, "When the fullness of time came."
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:28.280]   For God, there is a fulfilling of the gospel according to his timing, according to the
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.560]   fullness of time.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:41.600]   Galatians 4, verse 4, if you guys want to look that one up.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:48.200]   And so now in Daniel, we see that there's going to be these four kingdoms.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:52.840]   We're going to see out of this one kingdom, this person is going to come out, and this
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.960]   one person is going to be doing something for three and a half years.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.720]   And during that three and a half year period, there's going to be something called the abomination
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:00.720]   of desolation.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.160]   That's what we know through Daniel.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:11.880]   Can you turn with me to Matthew, chapter 24?
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.760]   Now we're fast-forwarding, right?
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:20.720]   Now imagine all this historical stuff that happens in between the time of Daniel and
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.880]   the time of this book, Matthew.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.400]   Matthew, chapter 24, and here's Jesus.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:33.080]   This is called the Olivet Discourse, meaning this is actually the last discourse that he
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:37.080]   preaches in Matthew, one of the last things he preaches to his disciples.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.120]   And he's telling them of the signs of the close of the age in verse 3.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.120]   So look down at verse 3.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.720]   It says, "As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying,
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.520]   'Tell us, when will these things be?
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.840]   And what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age?'"
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.760]   Isn't that cool?
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:58.040]   They know that Jesus, he has said it like now, that he's going to be leaving, and so
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.560]   they're saying, "This time of your coming, tell us."
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.280]   And Jesus answered them, "See that no one leads you astray, for many will come in my
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.520]   name saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will lead many astray.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.540]   And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:12.320]   See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place."
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   Get this part.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:17.680]   "But the end is not yet."
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.680]   That's key.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.720]   "For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.280]   and earthquakes in various places.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.440]   All these are but the beginning of the birth pains."
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:31.480]   Meaning, these are like the contractions that happen in the beginning, before you give birth.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.080]   Meaning this is not the birthing period.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:37.360]   Verse 9, "Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.720]   will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.440]   And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.800]   Many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.840]   And because lawlessness will be increased and the love of many will grow cold, but the
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.640]   one who endures to the end will be saved.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.560]   And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.560]   to all nations.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.400]   And then the end will come."
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:03.000]   This is all before the tribulation as we know it.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Now verse 15.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.440]   So the end has come, right?
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:12.240]   "So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel standing in
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:17.280]   the holy place," that is, that this person is going to go into the holy place and trample
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.280]   it.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.200]   And verse 15, this is so tongue-in-cheek, right?
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   Let the reader understand.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.840]   Verse 16, "Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.680]   Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in the house, and let
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.680]   the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.600]   And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:39.480]   Pray that your flight may not be in winter or in Sabbath, for then there will be a great
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:44.160]   tribulation such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.160]   never will be.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.480]   And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.840]   But for the sake of the elect, those days will be cut short.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:56.560]   Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ,' or 'There he is,' do not believe
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:03.600]   it, for false Christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.640]   so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect."
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.880]   See I have told you beforehand, he's saying that.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:14.560]   He's saying, "Hey, I'm warning you of this."
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.920]   So if they say to you, "Look, he is in the wilderness," do not go out.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.720]   If they say, "Look, he is in inner rooms," do not believe it, for as lightning comes
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:24.240]   from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.080]   Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.760]   Verse 29, "Immediately after tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened and the
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.160]   moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.400]   heavens will be shaken.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:39.000]   Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.680]   earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:48.120]   power and great glory, and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:52.680]   will gather his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other."
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.800]   There is going to be a time when we look up into the heavens and into the clouds, and
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.000]   we're going to see the coming of the Son of Man, right?
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.640]   Jesus' second coming.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:07.640]   Now we are called to decipher all this stuff.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:12.280]   But all we know is that Jesus is saying a little bit more stuff, and we still don't
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.680]   know what the heck he's talking about.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.680]   But he is talking a little bit more about this abomination of desolation that's coming
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.720]   and this great tribulation that's coming.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.720]   We're going to skip.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:27.720]   Can we go to the next slide?
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.680]   Okay, we can read this one.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.560]   "Let no one deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion comes
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.760]   first and the man of lawlessness is revealed."
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.760]   You guys see this?
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.440]   There are so many different passages in Scripture.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.160]   We're seeing this man, this person that's going to come out.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.000]   It says, "The son of destruction who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.160]   God or object of worship so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, abomination
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.960]   of desolation, proclaiming himself to be God."
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.960]   Okay, next slide.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:00.560]   1 John 2.22, "Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is Christ?
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.400]   This is the Antichrist.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.480]   He who denies the Father and the Son.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.520]   No one who denies the Son has the Father.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.880]   Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also."
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.000]   And in chapter 4, ooh, small.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.360]   "Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:18.800]   God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.560]   By this you know the Spirit of God.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:24.440]   Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:27.200]   spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.600]   This is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you heard was coming."
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.800]   So he's coming in the future, and now is in the world already.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.000]   That's what a lot of you guys had questions about, right?
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.440]   Spiritual children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.960]   than he who is in the world.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.600]   They are from the world, therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:48.680]   In verse 4 there, if you guys see, "For he who is in you is greater than he who is in
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.040]   the world," you're left to wonder, "Is that Satan?"
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.160]   But he was just talking about this guy Antichrist, so is that the Antichrist?
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.600]   We're gonna try to solve all of this today, okay?
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:02.360]   Okay, any questions up to this point?
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.120]   Is anyone completely lost?
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:11.560]   There's understanding that this, I'm just displaying the prophecies right now.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.280]   You guys could really ask questions if you want to.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:18.720]   It would be helpful, because I don't know if I make sense.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.720]   Yes?
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:20.720]   Uh-huh?
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:21.720]   Uh-huh?
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.720]   Yes.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.720]   Okay.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:24.720]   Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.720]   I'm saying yes, I heard your question.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.720]   Okay.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.720]   So, no one will know, right?
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:28.720]   No one will know.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.720]   So, I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:31.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:36.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:50.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:52.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:54.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:08.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.720]   I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:17.520]   So then, Emily's question was, then, because right now there are unreached people groups,
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.520]   why do we say something like Jesus can come at any moment?
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.440]   Alright, so there are different schools of thought.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:30.240]   There is an understanding also that even though we're trekking towards that, at any moment,
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:37.960]   there can be, like in a way that we do not understand, that every nation will be reached.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.960]   And though we have like these numbers of how many unreached people groups there are and
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:45.720]   we try our best to kind of keep track of these things, then like we can say like, oh, we
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.840]   checked the last box, right?
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.560]   We got the last unreached people group.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.920]   And then we can start to think like, oh, then can we predict it?
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.920]   Then the end will come.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.520]   Well, it says later on in Matthew that we can't predict it.
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.680]   So there's this element of even that, we can't predict.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:05.720]   So there's like, for example, there's one pastor that I highly respect who thinks that
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.960]   this is gonna be done in a miraculous way.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.760]   That there's gonna be a time when the gospel is going to be preached in a supernatural
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.120]   way where all of the earth is going to hear about Christ.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.400]   So it's interesting stuff and it's all speculation.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   Any other questions?
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.800]   That was a great question.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   Okay, well if there's no other questions, let's go into Roman numeral two, the first
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:28.800]   beast.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:36.960]   Okay, let's put it all together now.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.200]   Number 13, verse one.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:47.680]   It says, "And I saw a beast rising out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads, with
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.480]   ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads."
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:57.480]   Okay, where did we see a beast rising out of the sea?
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.720]   In the book of Daniel, right?
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:04.120]   We heard about these four beasts that are gonna be rising out of the sea.
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.000]   It says that there's this one beast that's rising out of the sea and then where have
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.680]   we seen the ten horns and seven heads?
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.680]   The dragon.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.680]   Okay, so if you guys look back at chapter 12, verse three, you're gonna see this dragon
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.960]   had ten horns and seven heads.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:22.600]   Now a question to you guys is this.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:32.160]   Why do you think the first beast has these ten horns and seven heads?
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:39.160]   What is this relationship that's happening with the dragon?
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:45.160]   The answer is actually right in the text if you guys wanna look.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.160]   Like, "Oh, interesting.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:54.160]   They have the same amount of heads and horns.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.160]   Why?"
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.160]   Anyone?
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.160]   Mm-hmm?
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:06.160]   Perfect, right on.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.680]   That's exactly what it was, that he was given the authority of Satan.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:14.160]   So whoever this first beast is, it's given the authority of Satan himself.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.160]   Let's look at verse three there.
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.440]   "One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.640]   the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.600]   And they worshipped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.880]   worshipped the beast, saying, 'Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?'"
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:42.360]   First bullet point here, the first beast refers to a kingdom and a man.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:47.960]   So if you wanna think about it in this manner, if you guys think about Adolf Hitler, right,
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:53.160]   and you think about the Third Reich, you tend to kinda almost use them in a synonymous way.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:58.200]   Adolf Hitler was, was Nazism, right?
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.880]   And so that's how this is kinda being used.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.840]   This is a kingdom and a man.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.680]   So Daniel attests to the fact that this beast is a kingdom, and we're gonna talk about him
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.280]   and being a man very soon.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.600]   Next bullet point, this is the same beast that is mentioned in Revelation chapter 11,
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.600]   verse 7.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:16.080]   In Revelation chapter 11, verse 7, it says, "And when they have finished our testimony,
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:20.920]   the beast that rises from the bottomless pit will make war on them, and conquer them, and
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.560]   kill them."
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.080]   So the first beast coming out of the sea, this is the next bullet point, there are a
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.440]   couple options as to what sea refers to.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:30.640]   Why is it coming out of the sea?
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.280]   Well, we saw in Daniel that these four beasts were coming out of the sea, there are four
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.600]   kingdoms, and so I believe that's number two.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.840]   But let me read number one first.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:43.200]   The number one is, "The beast comes from a general evil place, as the sea was seen as
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:47.120]   a place of evil that would one day be done away with, as seen in Revelation 21.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.960]   I have this passage up for you guys here.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:54.000]   The sea was seen as a place of evil, and that in the new heavens and new earth, we're not
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.040]   going to go into what this means, but it says, "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth,
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:01.640]   for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more."
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:05.560]   The sea was generally seen as a dark, mysterious, deadly place.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:10.040]   They lived right next to the Mediterranean Sea, which was so big that it acted almost
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.800]   like an ocean.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:16.380]   Many people perished, but it was the only way by which they could have a lot of their
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:21.240]   food source, as well as all the trade and trafficking that would happen during this
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.320]   time, so you had to brave it if you wanted to thrive as a nation.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:29.120]   The sea was seen as an evil place, so maybe this beast is coming just from a place of
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.120]   evil.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:35.920]   Revelation 11, verse 7 can further attest to the fact that this beast came out of the
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.920]   bottomless pit.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.000]   Is this a reference to the bottomless pit?
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   Maybe.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.540]   I believe, number two, the beast comes from a far-off nation.
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:53.860]   For example, as Roman boats would be seen coming by sea.
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:59.020]   We saw that in Daniel chapter 7, verse 23.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:00.020]   Do I have that slide?
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.020]   Daniel 7, 23?
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:02.020]   Okay.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:05.540]   I put verse 1 through 8 there, but it's actually verse 23.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.860]   "Thus he said, 'As for the fourth beast, there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth,
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:12.060]   and it shall be different from all the kingdoms, and it shall devour the whole earth, and trample
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.740]   it down, and break it to pieces.'"
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:20.420]   So Revelation plus Daniel equals this beast is a kingdom, right?
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:21.860]   Okay.
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:22.860]   Next bullet point.
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:28.180]   "The ten horns and seven heads are to show this beast similarity to the dragon," as we
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.740]   saw in Revelation 12, 3.
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:33.340]   We further see that this is the authority of Satan given to him, as we see in chapter
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:36.460]   13, verse 2.
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:40.460]   So the beast has the same power over the world as the dragon.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:45.260]   It's the same power, same authority that Satan had.
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:48.300]   We talked a little bit about Satan and his power last week.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:53.020]   Well, let's see who, in 2 Corinthians chapter 4, verse 4, talking of Satan, "In their case,
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:56.380]   the God of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers to keep them from seeing the
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:59.300]   light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:02.580]   If you look up top there, the God of this world.
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:07.340]   He has this rulership, even though we know that God is sovereign and ruling over all,
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:10.900]   that Satan is given a type of authority over the world.
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:15.700]   And now we know, during this time that we're reading about, in this case, it is greater
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:18.380]   than ever, because he's locked out of heaven, right?
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:25.180]   And all the demons running rampant on planet Earth.
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:29.900]   And so now all of this power is transferred then to this first beast.
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:30.900]   Next bullet point.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:33.300]   "The formation of the four beasts found in Daniel 7."
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:38.900]   I don't think I have this one down.
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:42.580]   So if you guys remember the four beasts that came out of the sea in Daniel 7, we saw that
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:44.460]   it looked like these different creatures, right?
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:50.180]   A bear, a leopard, and a lion.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:54.420]   It says that a fourth beast came that was exceedingly terrifying and greater than all
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:55.780]   of these other ones.
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:53:01.420]   Well here, we see one that is all of the above, right?
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:07.860]   A conglomeration.
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.460]   You see that in verse 2 of chapter 13.
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:14.580]   It says, "The beast was like a leopard, feet were like a bear, its mouth was like a lion."
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.340]   So all three of those kingdoms are hit.
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:18.780]   And it says, "This is the fourth kingdom."
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:26.300]   Now the cool thing is, we're talking of Rome, but we're not talking of Rome anymore, right?
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:29.940]   Now this is the whole principle of the prophetic already but not yet.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.340]   That Rome came and it was during that time period when Jesus was crucified.
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.780]   He was cut off at the 69th week.
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:42.140]   Now from here, during the last week, an extra measure of prophecy is given to show that
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:45.820]   this was another shadow of what is to come.
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:50.180]   That Rome was just a shadow of this final thing that's going to be happening.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:55.580]   That Rome was but a picture of what the world would look like.
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:54:02.220]   A world that's led and that Satan has authority over.
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:05.540]   So next bullet point down.
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:08.700]   Think about the kingdom of the world found in Revelation chapter 11 verse 15.
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:12.100]   In chapter 11 verse 15 it said that, "Then the seventh angel blew his temple and there
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:16.060]   were loud voices in heaven saying, 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:17.980]   Lord and of his Christ.'"
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:20.860]   Remember that we talked about though there are many kingdoms, why is it being used in
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:21.860]   a singular sense?
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:24.700]   Well, this is kind of the same thing that we're talking about.
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:26.980]   Now the world has unified.
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:36.340]   The world is unified in this pursuit to worship this beast and to this dragon.
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.460]   Next bullet point.
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:38.460]   So this beast, who is it?
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:41.660]   This is the Antichrist.
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:45.260]   The one that we've been talking about through Daniel and Matthew and a bunch of other texts.
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:48.780]   Second Thessalonians, etc.
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:51.300]   The spirit of the Antichrist has always been around.
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:56.820]   So even though this is going to be a tangible, physical man that comes about, the spirit
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:55:00.700]   of the Antichrist has always been around and we know that through passages like 2 Thessalonians
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:04.580]   2.5, 1 John 2.22-23, and chapter 4 verse 1-5.
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:09.360]   And that this Antichrist, what this Antichrist is meant to do is to lead people astray from
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.360]   the real Messiah.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.060]   And I want you guys to add something here.
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:20.860]   From the real Messiah, by claiming deity himself.
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:26.640]   A way he does that is by saying that I am the Messiah.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.780]   And so when we read through passages, do I have those passages up?
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:33.860]   In 2 Thessalonians 2.5, we already read this but let's look at it again.
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:38.940]   It says, "For that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first."
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:39.940]   And we're seeing this.
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:43.340]   "And the man of lawlessness is revealed, the Antichrist, the son of destruction, who opposes
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.180]   and exalts himself."
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:47.700]   And he takes the place in the temple.
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:48.700]   Next slide.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:51.100]   And we saw this one too, right?
[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:53.860]   This is the Antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:54.860]   Next one.
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:59.420]   And that this Antichrist is going to be the one who does not confess that Jesus is from
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.420]   God.
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:04.740]   And that the spirit of the Antichrist, if you look there at verse 3, is coming now and
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:06.180]   in the world already.
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:07.560]   So the spirit is here.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:12.740]   So this Antichrist is going to be almost this picture.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:18.560]   Like this is the image of what the world looks like now.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:22.960]   That claims deity, that says, "I want to sit on the throne."
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.340]   And we can attest to that, right?
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:29.020]   And we're going to be talking about that in just a second too.
[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:30.020]   Next bullet point.
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:32.940]   "If Satan is behind the Antichrist by giving him power and authority, then we understand
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:35.240]   that this is more than a man and a kingdom.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:45.020]   This is a living embodiment of unbelief of human hearts that are deceived by Satan."
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:48.800]   And next bullet point down, the Antichrist is still an actual man.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.240]   Paul sees him as a person to come.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:55.580]   Also he is identified with personal pronouns throughout Revelation.
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:59.720]   Not to mention through all the prophecies that came before, it was used with personal
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:05.780]   pronouns.
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:10.840]   Next bullet point, he mimics the Messiah by having a mortal wound that is healed.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.680]   And then it says that the world marvels, right?
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.480]   But he's mimicking the Messiah.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.480]   He's mimicking deity, right?
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.080]   Christ's death and resurrection.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:25.140]   So due to this, they marvel at the beast and they worship the dragon.
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:27.960]   And then the beast proclaims blasphemies against God.
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:31.000]   If you look at verse 5, at chapter 13, read with me.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.320]   "And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.600]   allowed to exercise authority for 42 months."
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.600]   Remember that number.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:42.080]   "It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:44.680]   dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven."
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:50.960]   Now everything that's going on there, that is the abomination of desolation that we saw.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:55.000]   That he's going to come into the temple and almost take the throne and say that, "I am
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:03.400]   God, worship me."
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.880]   Look at those words that are used.
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.520]   Who is like the beast?
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.140]   Who can fight against it?
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:14.040]   That should actually, if you're familiar with scripture, sound familiar because all through
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:19.240]   the Old Testament, it is used as something that is told of God.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:24.680]   So for example, in Exodus chapter 15, verse 11, "Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods?
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:28.720]   Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?"
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.720]   Next one.
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:34.480]   Psalm 113.5, "Who is like the Lord our God who is seated on high?"
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.480]   Next one.
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:40.280]   Isaiah 40.18, "To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness compare with him?"
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:43.760]   And so in chapter 13, verse 4, when it says, "Who is like the beast and who can fight against
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:44.760]   it?"
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:49.400]   And this Messiah-like guy sits on the throne and everyone is starting to marvel and worship,
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:51.560]   you see what's going on.
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:59.000]   The world is worshiping a false god.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.120]   Next bullet point down, "This blaspheming of God, his name and his dwelling is the same
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:06.800]   abomination of desolation found in Matthew and Daniel."
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:14.840]   Then in Daniel chapter 7, verse 24 to 25, oh, I wrote it down, okay.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:15.840]   Look at verse 25.
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.960]   It says, "He shall speak words against the Most High and shall wear out the saints of
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:22.360]   the Most High and shall think to change the times and the law."
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.840]   And we see him doing that.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:27.320]   Look down at chapter 13, verse 7.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:32.840]   "Also, it, the beast, was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:37.280]   And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:40.200]   All who dwell on earth will worship it and everyone whose name has not been written before
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:43.840]   the foundation of the world and the book of life of the Lamb who was slain.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.380]   If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:48.520]   If anyone is to be taken captive, to captivity he goes.
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:51.640]   If anyone is to be slain with a sword, with a sword must he be slain.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:56.520]   Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints."
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:59.600]   By the way, in verse 10, if you look there, it says, "If anyone is to be taken captive,
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.600]   to captivity he goes."
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.720]   You're like, "What is this talking about?"
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:05.800]   "If anyone is to be slain with a sword, with a sword must he be slain."
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:09.320]   This is talking about if there are any believers during this time.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:13.840]   If there is anyone who has held out and become believers during the time of this tribulation,
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.840]   then do not resist.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:20.960]   It's this idea of go and be taken captive and be killed.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:26.000]   We're going to see at the end of chapter 13 when we're talking about the mark, there's
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.760]   going to be real ramifications of this bifurcating of two types of people that continues to happen
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.200]   through revelation.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.920]   The people who worship Satan and the people who worship God.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.840]   All right, next bullet point.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:44.020]   This is kind of more an application type thing.
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:47.920]   We all worship something.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:54.800]   We either worship God himself or we worship everything the beast and the dragon represents.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.840]   There is no in between.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:03.480]   So though we typically identify different idols in our lives, they all belong to evil.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.520]   I want you guys to think a little bit about your own lives, right?
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:11.640]   Think about everything you do in life on a moment to moment basis.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.700]   This is the spiritual reality.
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:22.360]   You are either worshiping God or you are worshiping something evil.
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.160]   That's it.
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.960]   What is being clarified here in Revelation is the reality of life today.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:34.120]   It's just being shown in stark contrast and detail.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:44.960]   This is amazing because I think, we think a lot of our day is neutral, right?
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:52.260]   Like watching a TV show, playing ping pong, we think it's neutral.
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:56.960]   There is an active worship going on in that time and place.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.840]   Question to you is think about your own day and think about what's going on.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:06.360]   We can go on with this one but I'll let you guys stew on that one.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.360]   Next bullet point.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.160]   He has authority for 42 months which is again the last 3.5 years of the great tribulation.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:14.880]   Notice again that it says that he is allowed authority.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.360]   He is allowed authority.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.760]   It is an illusion when people think they are in control.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:23.880]   It is an illusion even for Satan to think that he has control during this time.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.600]   He is given it.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.920]   If you guys look to chapter 13, you're going to see that every time it says that it was
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.920]   given him.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.920]   It was given him.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.600]   It was given to him as permission from God.
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:41.160]   Remember that in Job 1.12.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:46.760]   Conquering the saints means that he can harm them and even kill them, not take their salvation.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.720]   That would be bringing peace to us.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:54.280]   He cannot take their salvation.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.680]   That is why in verse 10 it said, "Just go and be taken captive.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.520]   Go and be killed.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:04.480]   Don't pledge allegiance to the beast so that you can survive.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:11.960]   Just go and die because you're going to be with me."
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.280]   Roman numeral three, the second beast.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.120]   The fact that the second beast will come from the earth might show that this is someone
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.600]   nearby and local.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.200]   This comes from chapter 13 verse 11.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.640]   It says, "Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.160]   It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:31.400]   It exercised all the authority of the first beast in its presence and makes the earth
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:35.400]   and its inhabitants worship the first beast whose mortal wound was healed.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.120]   It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.120]   people.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.560]   And by the signs that is allowed to work in the presence of the beast, it deceives those
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.680]   who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the beast that was wounded by the
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.400]   sword and yet lived.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.640]   And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.920]   might even speak and might cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.920]   be slain.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.720]   Also, it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.960]   be marked on the right hand or the forehead so that no one can buy or sell unless he has
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:11.080]   the mark that is the name of the beast or the number of its name."
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.400]   So we saw the beast coming out of the sea from far off land.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.320]   Now this is someone probably local.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.320]   Now think about this.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.120]   If there is an Antichrist that is coming from a far off land, then you want someone that
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.640]   feels more local, right?
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.800]   To attest for this person.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:30.760]   So we're seeing the works of another person here.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.080]   And it says that he will look like a lamb, which is Jesus, but he will speak like a dragon,
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.120]   which is Satan.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:51.840]   This is likely a false prophet.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.720]   If Antichrist, this Antichrist that we're talking about, if he is the one claiming to
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:00.440]   be God, this is the false prophet that is like, so if he is a false God, here is the
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.440]   false prophet.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.480]   Does that make sense?
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:07.120]   Because there is the real God and then there are his prophets.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.120]   That's why we have this.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.280]   Now there is the false God and here is the false prophet, the one who attests to him,
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:17.000]   who points to him and says, "Thus saith the Lord."
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.320]   This is the type of guy that's coming out.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.760]   False prophets are very winsome and attractive in speech.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.160]   A bulk of what they say might even be truthful.
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:31.360]   Not the truth, truthful.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.160]   So false prophets are very winsome and attractive in speech.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:38.600]   Let's look at some text here about false prophets.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.920]   You could swing through all of these.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.840]   Matthew chapter 7, verse 15 through 20 says, "Beware of false prophets who come to you
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:49.560]   in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.320]   You will recognize them by their fruits.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.120]   Are grapes gathered from the thorn bushes or figs from thistles?
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.680]   So every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased trees bear bad fruit.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.440]   A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.520]   Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.760]   Thus you will recognize them by their fruits."
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.400]   So he's telling us how we can recognize a false prophet.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:15.280]   Now the false prophets being talked about in Matthew there is most likely talking about
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:23.360]   these Jewish leaders, the Pharisees who are saying this is how you're going to be saved
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.040]   and things like that.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:29.280]   But he's saying even here with these types of false prophets you will recognize them
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.600]   by their fruits.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:35.480]   Next, Galatians 1, 6 through 7.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.120]   Now this is the working of the false prophets, the Judaizers.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:42.080]   "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.760]   and are turning to a different gospel.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.640]   Not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.640]   gospel of Christ."
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:50.680]   This is a false prophet that has done this, a false teacher.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.720]   And look, can you believe that there are people who have just heard the gospel, who are so
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:59.200]   close to the time of the death and resurrection of Christ, and they are already being led
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.200]   astray.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.260]   Paul is using a very strong language here, right?
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:07.760]   Not only in the fact that he's saying they're going to be accursed, but that I am astonished,
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.240]   I am like flabbergasted.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:10.240]   What?
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:13.280]   Like how can you already have been led astray?
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.280]   And these aren't dumb people.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:17.720]   We're not saying, "Oh, you know, like if they're led astray, they're dumb."
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.360]   If you say that, you're dumb, right?
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.000]   Like that's how it should be.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.800]   What it is, is the fact that they're led astray means that these false teachers are winsome
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.960]   and attractive in their speech.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.280]   That's what false prophets are like.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.280]   Next one.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.280]   2 Timothy 4, 3-4.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:34.320]   "For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:38.920]   ears," here it is, "they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:42.040]   and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths."
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:47.160]   Now if we're talking about the dragon and the first and second beasts, we're saying
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.720]   like, "Okay, these are the ones that are like, 'Oh, all the people are victims.'"
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.960]   Like they're the ones being tricked.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:57.360]   But actually there are two parts to this, and this is a passage that I think really
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.360]   sheds light on it.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:01.200]   "They will accumulate for themselves teachers to what?
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.200]   Suit their own passions."
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:07.560]   Right in line with this.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.240]   Mankind during this time, they are not the victims.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.560]   They are just like this.
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.680]   This is one kingdom of evil.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.400]   That's just how it is.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.400]   Next one.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.600]   And then 2 Peter 2-1.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.560]   "But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:25.880]   you who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the master who brought
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:31.200]   them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction."
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.120]   So these are false prophets.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.600]   Next bullet point there is false prophets walk amongst us today.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.360]   We're going to move on from this.
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.840]   We're going to come back to that at the end.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.400]   We're almost done here.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:44.560]   We must learn to discern truth from error because these false prophets are going to
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:48.360]   bring false teaching.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:52.200]   And so we must discern truth from error.
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:57.560]   Now right here I have 8 consequences of false doctrines written for you.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.360]   And this is from a guy named Tim Chalice, and I thought it was excellent how he broke
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.360]   it down.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:05.560]   So here are false doctrines.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:10.080]   False doctrines confuses truth and error, while sound doctrine distinguishes truth and
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.080]   error.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:19.400]   False doctrine prevents godliness, while sound doctrine promotes godliness.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:24.280]   False doctrine promotes sin, while sound doctrine prevents sin.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:29.240]   False doctrine elevates ungodly leadership, while sound doctrine qualifies godly leadership.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:34.440]   False doctrine permits false teachers, while sound doctrine protects against false teachers.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:38.400]   False doctrine removes God's blessing, while sound doctrine ensures God's blessing.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:41.880]   False doctrine debilitates the church for times of difficulty, while sound doctrine
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.360]   equips the church for times of difficulty.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:48.120]   False doctrine weakens the future church, while sound doctrine strengthens the future
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.120]   church.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.680]   And there's an element of all of this where you will know them by their fruits.
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:00.200]   So if you see the false doctrines, these things are going to be happening.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.720]   It's going to confuse truth and error.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.000]   It's going to prevent godliness.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.360]   It's going to provoke sin.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.280]   It's going to elevate ungodly leadership.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.880]   It's going to permit false teaching.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.280]   It is going to remove God's blessing.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.720]   It is going to debilitate the church for times of difficulty.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:17.000]   It is going to weaken the future church.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.320]   And so how can we discern, right?
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320]   This is what's going to happen.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.320]   This is the consequence.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:27.360]   Well, the next slide, I have for you a little chart here.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.000]   So how can you tell?
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.400]   Well, this is a simple one.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.800]   There's a truth portion and a false portion.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:43.560]   So if the origin of the false teaching, if it's from the creator or if it has to do with
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.440]   the creator, then you accept it.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:50.480]   But if it comes from creation or has to do with creation, you reject it.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.960]   Now don't think too deeply into that one.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.680]   Authority, if it's biblical, you can accept it.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.080]   If it's unbiblical, don't accept it.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:03.680]   Now we're like, "Uh, duh," you know, like, "Pastor Nathan, come on."
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:13.320]   Isn't it crazy how like just that second one there is so, like, we're really bad at it?
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:18.080]   Like if a false teacher were to come to you and say something, like they said a passage
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:24.840]   and then they described it, would you be able to discern whether that was biblical or unbiblical?
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.000]   Consistency, is it familiar or is it unfamiliar?
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.160]   This is more important than you might realize too.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:33.920]   Like if it's something that has been tested and proved throughout history, then you can
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.920]   accept it.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:39.080]   But if it's unfamiliar, someone's coming up with like, "I have this new knowledge," then
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:43.400]   you're like, "Uh, uh," you know, like, "Please get away from me."
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.400]   All right.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:50.800]   Quality, if it's sound versus unsound, that means it holds weight, it's rational, it's
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.120]   logical, it makes sense.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:58.240]   And this might be like another "duh" thing too, but you'd be surprised at how there are
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.320]   so many false teachers out there who are propagating things where you're like, "Do you not see
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:09.160]   that your A is false and so your B is false?"
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:16.960]   And like, you know, now this is one thing, one like trick I'll say to you guys.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:22.440]   There are going to be people who say something A and it's going to be false.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.680]   And so you're going to be like, "Oh, that was weird."
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:29.560]   But they're going to move really quickly on to B. So A, therefore B. But B actually makes
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.560]   sense.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:31.560]   Okay.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.560]   But A is connected to it.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:38.680]   So A is the origin, goes to B, and then from there it just goes C, D, E, F. Now if you
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:43.120]   believe B and on, it all makes sense.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:47.560]   But when you want to test it to see if it's sound or unsound, you need to get to the origin
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.420]   of it.
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:53.280]   So they're going to say things like, "Well, do you believe this?"
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.280]   And you're going to be like, "No, I don't believe that."
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.280]   "Well, but what about this?"
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.600]   And you're going to be like, "Oh, I guess that kind of makes sense."
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.240]   And from there they're going to take it.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.440]   If you guys have ever read the book The Da Vinci Code or something like that, that's all
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.400]   that book is.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:11.600]   It says very false things at its foundation.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.880]   And then because of that, everything logically makes sense after that.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:19.440]   And so the whole of the argument sounds good.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.960]   "Dude, then what's wrong with our faith?
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.800]   What's wrong with our Bible?"
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:28.160]   And then you realize, "Oh, but the beginning of it's wrong," meaning the whole thing is
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.160]   false, right?
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.960]   It's kind of like that.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.120]   The next one down there is benefit.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.320]   Is it healthy or unhealthy?
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.840]   Just so simple.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.720]   Is this good for us or is it not?
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:42.120]   Value, is it profitable or unprofitable?
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.120]   Same thing.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:47.640]   So the Christian's responsibility there, if it checks all these things on the left side,
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.640]   accept it.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:53.600]   If it checks even one of the right side, you got to like, "Uh."
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.600]   Okay?
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.160]   All right.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.640]   Next slide.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.600]   So some false teachers through history.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:03.320]   There's one at the time, Brian McLaren.
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:10.360]   He is the prosperity and then the postmodern gospel.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:14.200]   I kind of came through this guy so we can call him a false teacher.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.200]   Next one.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.200]   Benny Hinn.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.040]   You guys have maybe seen him.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:22.000]   People make YouTube videos of him pretending to be a Star Wars guy and stuff.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.240]   Have you seen that?
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.240]   It's so funny.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.080]   Benny Hinn is a guy who slays people by the spirit.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:34.040]   So people will come in droves and lines and then he'll do this and they'll start convulsing
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.160]   and stuff.
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.160]   And then he gets his jacket.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:40.800]   He pulls off his jacket and one at a time he goes down the line and hits each person.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.840]   Every person is falling down, being slain by the spirit.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.320]   And there's a YouTube.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.960]   I'm wasting time but I don't care.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:52.000]   There's this YouTube video where someone put a lightsaber instead of the jacket.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.040]   It's so funny.
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:56.880]   I'm going to show you guys.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:57.880]   It's so funny.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.000]   It shouldn't be funny though.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.440]   Next one.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.640]   Charles Taze Russell.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.960]   Anyone know who this is?
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:04.960]   Huh?
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:10.560]   Oh, anyone know who Charles Taze Russell is?
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.560]   Jehovah's Witnesses.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.560]   Nice.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.560]   Great.
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:14.560]   Founder of that.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.560]   Know these things.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.560]   Okay.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.560]   Next one.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.560]   Ellen White.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.560]   Anyone?
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.560]   Seventh Day Adventist.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.560]   Did I write this down?
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.560]   How do you guys know this?
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.560]   Good job.
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.560]   Next one.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.560]   Joseph Smith.
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.560]   Mormons.
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.560]   Someone said that with great confidence.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.560]   Next one.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.560]   Mohammed.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.560]   Islam.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.560]   Okay.
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:32.560]   All right.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.560]   It says that this false prophet, the second beast, will do a few things.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.560]   It says that he's going to exercise the authority of the first beast, make people worship the
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.560]   first beast, perform great signs that look very similar to prophets of old, tell people
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:36.560]   to make an image of the first beast in their minds, and then make a new image of the first
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.560]   beast.
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:38.560]   So, this is a great example of a false prophet.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:39.560]   Next one.
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:40.560]   Muhammad.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.560]   Islam.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:42.560]   Okay.
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.560]   All right.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.560]   It says that this false prophet, the second beast, will do a few things.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.560]   It says that he's going to exercise the authority of the first beast, make people worship the
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.560]   first beast, perform great signs that look very similar to prophets of old, tell people
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:57.560]   to make an image of the first beast in their minds, and then make a new image of the first
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.560]   beast in their minds, and then make a new image of the first beast in their minds, and
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.560]   then make a new image of the first beast in their minds, and then make a new image of
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.560]   the first beast in their minds, and then make a new image of the first beast in their minds,
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.560]   and then make a new image of the first beast in their minds, and then make a new image
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.560]   of the first beast in their minds, and then make a new image of the first beast in their
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.560]   minds, and then make a new image of the first beast in their minds, and then make a new
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:04.560]   image of the first beast in their minds, and then make a new image of the first beast
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.560]   in their minds, and then make a new image of the first beast in their minds, and then
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:29.560]   make a new image of the first beast in their minds, and then make a new image of the first
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:57.760]   beast in their minds, and then make a new image of the first beast in their minds, and
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:26.960]   then make a new image of the first beast in their minds, and then make a new image of
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:55.160]   the first beast in their minds, and then make a new image of the first beast in their minds,
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.260]   song and break off.
