[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   Let me read in Hebrews chapter 9 verses 15 through 22 and then we'll get started.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.600]   For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant so that since a death has taken place
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.080]   for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.500]   who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.000]   For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.160]   For a covenant is valid only when men are dead, for it is never enforced while the one
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160]   who made it lives.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.880]   Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.560]   For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.440]   law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats with water and scarlet, wool and hyssop,
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.560]   and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, saying, "This is the blood of
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.800]   the covenant which God commanded you."
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.780]   And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.120]   with the blood.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.380]   And according to the law, one may almost say all things are cleansed with blood and without
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.320]   the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.160]   Let's pray.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.180]   Heavenly Father we pray for your blessing and your grace over this time.
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.800]   May your word, Lord, be made clear that your sheep may hear and follow your son Jesus.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.040]   We pray, Father God, that you give us understanding.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.220]   Help us, Lord, by your Spirit to give us a heart that is willing to be molded according
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.220]   to your word.
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.840]   You know, as you guys know, again, many things are going on right now and one of the biggest
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.080]   concerns that we have in the universal church is there's more and more division.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.720]   There are very strong opinions as to should the church gather, you know?
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.200]   Some are very concerned that we're gathering.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.160]   Or should we go inside or should we stay outside?
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.760]   What is our opinion about the Black Lives Matter movement?
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.720]   What are some of the opinions that we - and there's very strong opinions on both sides.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.160]   And again, if we're not careful we can end up fighting for things that may not be essential
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.760]   and the church may be divided as a result of that.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.160]   So we need to be careful, we guard our hearts.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.800]   There are things that we can debate within the context of the church.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.320]   You don't have to have the exact same opinion about every single thing that happens, whether
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.640]   that's economically, politically, socially, whatever that may be.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.800]   We can have our strong opinions but we need to make sure that what unites us continues
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.620]   to unite us.
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.800]   So you can be a Presbyterian, you can be a Baptist, you can have different views on certain
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.660]   doctrines but there are certain essential things that you cannot unite.
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.320]   If we have a different doctrine on the core of what Christianity stands for, unity is
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.600]   not uniformity.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.460]   As long as we love each other and we say we belong to one another, we're united.
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.080]   We are united by this doctrine.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:12.240]   Christ was crucified for our sins and by his blood atonement we are saved.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.840]   And it is that doctrine, if there's any compromise, any different opinion, you are not a Christian.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.160]   There is no unity.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.040]   We can be united in politics, we can be united in philosophy, we can be united in everything
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.400]   else but if we differ on that doctrine, we are not united, no matter how much we think
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.240]   we are on the surface.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:39.320]   See, blood atonement of Christ, his death and resurrection is Christianity.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.320]   That's what distinguishes us from the Jehovah Witnesses, that's what distinguishes us from
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.600]   the Mormons, that's what distinguishes us from any other, again, people who may call
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.320]   themselves Christians but according to the biblical doctrine they are not.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:03.660]   The foundation of Christian faith is forgiveness acquired by blood sacrifice and it must be
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.300]   blood sacrifice.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.280]   If you remember, as soon as Adam and Eve fell, one of the first things that we see is the
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:21.300]   offering that was given by Cain and Abel and Cain brought sacrifice from his harvest and
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.540]   Abel gave sacrifice of the animals and he said one was acceptable, one was not.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.080]   It doesn't explain why one was acceptable, one was not but we know clearly that the Bible
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.900]   teaches that without the atonement, without the forgiveness of sins, there is no restoration
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.880]   of relationship.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.980]   So again, it doesn't explain that in the book of Genesis but it is clearly explained later
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.600]   on in Scripture that without blood sacrifice there is no forgiveness.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.720]   In fact, this was a difficult thing that even the disciples had a hard time understanding.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.960]   They knew that the animals needed to be sacrificed but when Jesus clearly stated repeatedly over
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.240]   and over again that He was going to be to the cross and He was going to be crucified,
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.240]   even the disciples did not understand why would you do that?
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.960]   It wasn't until He was resurrected that they began to remember all that He said and then
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.120]   everything starts to click together.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.560]   But the fact that Jesus would have to die for their sins, even for the disciples, even
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.360]   though it was embedded into their culture, could not comprehend why would the Messiah
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.520]   have to die for us.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.560]   In fact, Paul himself was one of those Jews who had a hard time understanding and yet
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:46.520]   after he met Christ, he realized that what he was persecuting was God Himself.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.760]   Even though he thought he was persecuting to protect, you know, Judaism, he realized
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.800]   that he was in the wrong.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.280]   And in 1 Corinthians 1.23, he says, "We preach Christ crucified.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.120]   To Jews it is a stumbling block."
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.840]   And he knows that better than anybody else because he was very stumbled.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.400]   You know, it triggered him, it angered him to the point that he was willing to kill and
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.640]   persecute other Christians.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.000]   So he understands what it means.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.120]   He says, "Jews are stumbled by this."
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.200]   And that's an understatement because the first persecutors of the gospel, of the death and
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.280]   atonement of Jesus Christ through His blood, were his fellow countrymen.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.680]   They completely rejected it.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.660]   And he said to the Gentiles, "It is foolishness."
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.660]   Now think about it.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.720]   If you weren't a Christian, and to say, you know, God loves you and He wants to forgive
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.060]   you of your sins, and He said you have to believe that He died for you.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.360]   Now where else in your life do you see that being practiced?
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.800]   If you sin against me, I just suck it up and I just say, "Okay, you're forgiven.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.520]   I'm not going to hold it against you.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.480]   I'm not going to carry out vengeance.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.920]   I don't cut myself and shed my blood and say, 'Wait a second, let me forgive you.'"
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.920]   Right?
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.040]   So think about it from a non-Christian perspective.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.880]   Why did â€“ why was death mandated?
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.120]   Why was that the only way for God to forgive?
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.160]   Why couldn't He have just said, "You're forgiven"?
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:28.220]   What is this drama about His death and shedding of blood and suffering for our sins?
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.720]   Why was that necessary?
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.380]   Now a non-Christian may ask that question, but sad to say, many Christians in the church
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.440]   have never asked that question.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.680]   It's like, "Jesus Christ died for you."
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.680]   He did?
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.160]   He loves you.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.560]   And if you believe Him, you have eternal life.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.840]   Okay, I believe that.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.000]   Good.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.400]   But then many Christians have never searched beyond that.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.680]   Why did He have to die?
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.920]   And so there's a lot of Christians who don't understand the gospel.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:04.280]   The core message of the cross, the very reason why we are here Sunday after Sunday.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.320]   Why was He crucified?
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.280]   Why did He have to be crucified for my sins?
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.520]   Why couldn't He forgive just like the way we forgive?
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.560]   What is this drama about His atonement?
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.400]   Now the text that we're looking at isn't going to comprehensively answer that question
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.440]   because that is peppered throughout all of Scripture.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.440]   And so we don't have time to go through every single point of why this is necessary.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:34.080]   But He makes it very clear in verse 22, "According to the law, one may almost say all things
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.880]   are cleansed with the blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness."
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.240]   That was embedded into the Jewish culture.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.960]   In fact, it wasn't just embedded into Jewish culture.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:50.920]   If you look at ancient cultures, for whatever the reason, they understood that a god needed
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.820]   to be appeased by blood.
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.240]   Now we don't understand it because we're so many years removed from that.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.300]   But if you study most ancient cultures, there is some kind of blood sacrifice that needed
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:06.980]   to be given to appease whatever idol, whatever god that they worshipped.
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.160]   How they understood that, we don't know.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.960]   Now that's archaeologists, those are historians.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.860]   But it was understood, it was clearly taught, it's specific to the nation of Israel.
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.520]   Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:28.760]   You know that text that I just, I just quoted in verse 22, is a direct quote from Leviticus
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.240]   chapter 17, 11.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.880]   And it gives us a little bit of the background behind the atonement.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.520]   "For the life of the flesh is in the blood.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.800]   And I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.400]   For it is the blood by reason of the life that makes atonement."
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:56.560]   He says, "Because of man's robbing of God of the life that belonged to him."
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.160]   When we sinned, we basically robbed him of his glory that we are to give to him.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:07.060]   So he says, "Because you have taken life that belongs to him, the atonement for that
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.320]   is to offer up life."
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.900]   That's what he means here, life for life.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:19.120]   And so, because the blood represents and is the life of the flesh, he says the only way
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:28.040]   that your guilt, your guilt and my guilt, can be washed away is for life for life.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.040]   That was embedded.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.920]   Just like if somebody embezzled you $100,000, they can't just say, "Hey, I'm sorry."
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.400]   They have to pay you back, right?
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.520]   If they have the money, they have to pay you back.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.520]   And so that is embedded.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.720]   Again, we don't practice that in our culture, but that was embedded into the ancient cultures
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.680]   and specifically spelled out in the book of, to the nation of Israel.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.680]   Okay.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:59.760]   Now before I lose any of you, okay, how important is this?
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.000]   How important is this?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.520]   How important is it that not only do you hear this message, but you're able to articulate
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.760]   this?
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:14.440]   This is just as important as if you say you're a lawyer and you know the law.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.040]   This is just as important that if you're an accountant that you know the accounting, accounting
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.600]   laws, right?
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.640]   It is, it is foundational.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:31.460]   Every Christian that does not understand the blood atonement should commit some portion
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:37.300]   of this week, next week, or the next few months, doing your best to do your, to answer some
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.280]   of the questions that, that I'm not going to be able to answer all of it today, right?
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.460]   I'm just going to be looking at the text and what it says, the, the portions that it says,
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.460]   okay?
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.060]   Again, all of this to get you to pay attention, right?
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.740]   What is being said here is crucial.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:59.060]   So what I'm going to do this morning is outline three things that he says is why Jesus had
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.220]   to die.
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.340]   Three things, okay?
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.540]   I'm going to be covering two and the third one I'll, I'll come back to next week.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.540]   Okay, first one.
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:13.660]   It says in verse 15 that Jesus died to redeem those under the old covenant.
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.540]   Okay, Jesus died to redeem those under the old covenant.
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:24.460]   Verse 15, for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant so that since a death has
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:30.140]   taken place for the redemption of transgressions that were committed under the first covenant.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.220]   Let me stop right there, okay?
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:38.620]   First thing that he said, he said he had to die in order to redeem those and who are those
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:43.260]   people that he's referring to here?
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.060]   On the old covenant, right?
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.460]   He's first talking about those people in the old covenant.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.300]   That, you know, is a common question that we get all the time.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.420]   How did the old Jews in the old testament and old covenant, how were they saved?
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.960]   Well, he answers that here, right?
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:06.460]   He says that he had to die for the sins of those that were committed in the old testament.
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.220]   So they were saved the same way that we are saved.
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:14.220]   We're saved by the blood sacrifice for us in the past.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:19.140]   The saints of the old testament were saved by the blood that was going to be spilled
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.820]   that was coming.
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:26.700]   Okay, he says redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant,
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:33.660]   those who have been called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.100]   Now again, I want you to understand the history of Israel.
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.860]   Okay, this is why it's so important that when you read the Bible that you read it, you read
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:46.380]   it chronologically and consecutively because you're going to miss a whole point, a huge
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:51.980]   chunk of understanding the new testament if you don't know the history.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:58.340]   Now I'm not going to go through all of it, but if you remember before, as soon as Israel
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.500]   is delivered, God gives him the law, right?
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.500]   God gives him the law.
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.500]   He's preparing them.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.260]   When you get into this land, you're going to have to obey this law.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:12.540]   And he says, after he gives him this law, if you obey my commandments, all these blessings
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.980]   are going to come to you, right?
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.700]   Do you remember that?
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.300]   That's written in Exodus, is repeated in the book of Deuteronomy.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.300]   And he gives them the list of the blessing.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:27.620]   And then he goes, but if you don't obey me, here are the curses that are coming to you.
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:34.580]   And the curses that he mentions in Exodus and Deuteronomy outnumber the blessings almost
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.880]   threefold.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.400]   It's almost like he knew, he knew what was coming.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.140]   And he tells them, here's a blessing if you obey it.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:49.880]   And here are the curses that's going to come upon you and upon the nation of Israel if
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.380]   you do not obey.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.620]   Now if you've read the Old Testament, you know Israel's history.
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.060]   Did they obey or did they disobey?
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.180]   They disobeyed, right?
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.420]   You all said that, but I couldn't see you because of the mask, right?
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.420]   They disobeyed.
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:12.980]   In fact, not only did they disobey, every generation, every period of Israel's history
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.540]   is about their disobedience and God's judgment coming upon them.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.540]   Every generation.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:25.580]   In fact, if you look at the kingdom, when it splits from the north and the south, almost
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:33.300]   every king, almost every king, it says they did evil in the sight of God.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:38.540]   And so when the prophets finally show up to reveal to the nation of Israel where they
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:43.800]   stand before God, if you, again, if you read the major prophets and the minor prophets,
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.480]   what is the primary theme of the prophets?
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.300]   Judgment, right?
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.640]   Again I know you all said that.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.640]   I can't see you, right?
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.640]   Judgment.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:01.740]   So prophet after prophet after prophet after prophet, generation after generation after
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.460]   generation after generation.
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:12.760]   Israel's history is the curse of God that they are piling up from one generation to
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:19.160]   the next generation, from person to person, family to family, from tribe to tribe, from
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.640]   generation to generation.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:26.000]   That's why, you know, you start out well in the book of Genesis, right?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.760]   And then Genesis kind of goes through God's promise of what He's going to do to the nation
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.600]   of Israel, and then they start slipping.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.960]   As soon as they get formed, they start slipping.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:40.640]   And the rest of Israel's history is about the curse that's being piled up.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.800]   It's being piled up.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:48.480]   So by the time Malachi is finished, by the time Malachi is finished with the prophets
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:56.680]   before Jesus comes, if Israel has been paying attention, they would have been in tremendous
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.840]   despair.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:05.020]   And that was the intention that God was trying to build in the nation of Israel.
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:10.680]   That if they were afraid at the beginning of their history, imagine after hundreds and
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:16.800]   hundreds and hundreds of years of straying and disobeying God, even after He showed mercy
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:22.520]   after mercy after mercy, they would repeatedly, they would experience a brief moment of revival,
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.400]   and they would go right back to sitting over and over and over again.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:32.920]   But you know what's interesting is that when God gave the law to the nation of Israel,
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.940]   Israel's response, you could tell right from the beginning that they had no understanding
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:38.940]   of who they were.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.920]   Exodus chapter 19, 7, 8, "Moses came and called the elders of the people and said before
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   them all these words which the Lord had commanded him.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:54.000]   All the people answered together and said, 'All that the Lord has spoken, we will do.'"
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.400]   They were so confident.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.520]   Again in Exodus 24, 3, "Then Moses came and recounted to the people all the words of the
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.760]   Lord and all the ordinances, and all the people answered with one voice and said, 'All the
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:11.280]   words which the Lord has spoken, we will do.'"
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.080]   Exodus chapter 24, verse 7, "Then he took the book of the covenant and read it in the
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   hearing of the people, and they said, 'All that the Lord has spoken, we will do, and
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.960]   we will be obedient.'"
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.400]   They were arrogant from the get-go.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:35.720]   See by the time the law of Moses was given, do you remember what already happened?
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:40.000]   God already wiped out half of them because they couldn't wait.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Where is Moses?
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.440]   They already built a calf to worship.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.760]   They already saw the judgment of God.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.760]   Their hearts were already hardened and yet when God gave them these things and said,
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.320]   "If you obey, you will be blessed.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.080]   If you don't obey, you will be cursed," and they were so confident in one voice and they
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.680]   said, "We will do it."
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.480]   Remember I mentioned, I think it was last week, repentance is not saying, "Lord, I made
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.720]   a mistake, give me a second chance and I'll do better."
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.960]   Repentance is acknowledging and recognizing that we cannot and surrendering.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:19.320]   See the nation of Israel, the law was given to them in order that they may recognize who
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.640]   they are so that they may cling to Christ when he comes.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.080]   Instead, they saw the law as an avenue for righteousness.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:32.200]   They thought that if they obeyed these righteous laws that they can somehow bridge the gap.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:38.040]   Maybe I might not get all the way, maybe he can help me in some way, but they thought
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:43.240]   that this was some sort of a race that they're going to be able to win.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:53.200]   See, the law came to humble us and see the nation of Israel, even after all those sacrifice,
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:59.080]   hundreds and thousands and hundreds of thousands of sacrifice, at the end, they were more under
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.800]   a curse than they were at the beginning.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:09.400]   They were more under condemnation after decades and centuries of sacrifice than they were
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.480]   in the very beginning.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.600]   See, false religion always gives false hope.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.760]   And you look at that and we see that in Luke chapter 18, 10 through 14, when you see the
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:26.040]   Pharisees, two men went up into the temple to pray, one Pharisee and the other, a tax
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:33.120]   collector and the Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself, "God, I thank you that I
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.720]   am not like other people."
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.000]   You see where he felt righteousness?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.640]   He wasn't looking at God and saying, "Thank God I'm like you.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.800]   Thank God that your laws are reflected in my heart."
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.800]   That's not how he prayed.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.940]   He said, "Thank God I'm not like them.
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.240]   Thank God I'm better than those people.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.240]   I didn't kill anybody.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.240]   I didn't murder anybody.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.240]   I'm not a thief.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   I'm not a thief.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.240]   I'm not a thief.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.240]   I'm not a thief.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   I'm not a thief.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.240]   I'm not a thief.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.240]   I'm not a thief.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.240]   I'm not a thief.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.240]   I'm not a thief.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.240]   I'm not a thief.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.240]   I'm not a thief.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.240]   I'm not a thief."
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.240]   So, I think that's the danger of false religion.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.240]   And so, in comparison, they felt like they were closer to God.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.240]   "Thank God I'm not like those other people, swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.240]   this tax collector.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.240]   I fast twice a week.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.640]   I pay tithes of all that I get."
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:25.000]   Again, that's the danger of sometimes being at church.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.600]   Being at church without worshipping God in spirit and in truth gives you false sense
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.480]   of righteousness.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.840]   Being at church and engaging in active Bible study gives a false sense that we are right
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.840]   with God.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.240]   Because at least I go to Bible study.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.240]   At least I'm not like them.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.880]   At least I'm not robbing people.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.880]   At least I have some integrity.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.240]   At least I pay my taxes.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.240]   At least I'm good to my children.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.600]   At least I didn't cheat on my wife.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:57.000]   The tax collector, the sinner, standing some distance away was even unwilling to lift up
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.640]   his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast saying, "God, be merciful to me, the sinner."
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:10.880]   See, this position, this humble position of the tax collector is exactly why the law came.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:16.280]   The whole purpose of the sacrifices, that wasn't going to cause them to be forgiven.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.480]   There was no power in the sacrifice and the bloodshedding of the animals.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:27.060]   Because if the blood of the animal was going to atone for the blood of the human being,
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.000]   it would not be a fair trade.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.360]   You can't sacrifice an animal and say that's equal to a human.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:41.640]   The only way that you can, you can redeem what was lost by something equal or greater
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.400]   and the animal did not qualify.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:52.240]   See, this is the position that every single one of us is to be brought to.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:59.760]   See, until we come to the point where we beat our chests, that's me.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.160]   That tax collector is me.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.720]   Yeah, I grew up in the church.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.920]   Yeah, I memorize scripture.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.640]   I actually am generous and I give.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.640]   And I sacrifice.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.560]   And I'm good to my neighbors.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.320]   I'm a good father, I'm a good husband.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.960]   But woe to me.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:28.720]   Because when I see who God is and when I see who I am, I'm no different than this tax collector.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:36.440]   Have you ever been in debt to the point where you consider bankruptcy?
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.840]   Most of you guys are probably too young.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.360]   And I hope that you don't experience that.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:48.960]   But when you feel the weight of debt that you cannot pay, I mean, especially if you're
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.240]   a father, you know, and you have small children.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:59.560]   I remember, you know, years ago, you know, when our church was smaller and I couldn't.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:04.640]   I mean, I tried everything and I'm, you know, I'm a proud person.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.600]   Like I, you know, I'll wash cars.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   I'll wash toilets.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.760]   I'll do whatever I can, you know.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.520]   So there's no excuse that I can't make money.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.800]   But there was a period in life because of ministry, because of various things, I couldn't
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.700]   buy grocery for my family.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.480]   And I remember telling Esther, "Hey, don't buy milk today because I don't have enough
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.000]   money in the bank account today."
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.840]   And there was a stretch of life during that period where it was just stressful.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:37.440]   Where you've felt the pressure of debt to the point where there's nothing you can do.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.760]   And not only does it affect you, it affects your family and it affects your children.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:50.840]   See, the law was given to us to bring us to that point.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.440]   To recognize our desperateness.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:00.640]   So all of that was to teach the nation of Israel that they needed the Savior.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.720]   And He said Jesus had to die for that reason.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:10.680]   But all of that, all of those sacrifices simply pointed to the fact that they needed a real
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.680]   sacrifice.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.720]   They needed real atonement.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.360]   And Christ came to not only atone for the sins that were going to be committed, but
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.760]   for the sins that were committed in the Old Testament.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.360]   But here's the crazy thing, right?
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.160]   Here's the crazy thing.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:33.380]   We know that God's love is great because He came down to get us, right?
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.160]   He walked among us, He was incarnate, He was humiliated.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.040]   And He walked among us, among our filth, so He can save us.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.140]   But here's the crazy thing.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:49.280]   Not only did He forgive us, in verse 15b it says, "Those who have been called may receive
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.360]   the promise of eternal inheritance."
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.800]   So the second reason why Jesus died is to give those redeemed their promise eternal
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.800]   inheritance.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:05.220]   Again, I want, those of you who've read the Old Testament carefully, chronologically,
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:12.760]   right, just the fact that God didn't crush them should have been a cause of celebration.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:18.740]   They should have had the year of Jubilee every single year, every single day, right?
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   If you recognize, like, we've broken God's law almost every single day that I existed,
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:26.740]   every single day.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:31.780]   And so even though I gave sacrifice yesterday, I wake up this morning in need of another
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:32.780]   sacrifice.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.120]   And then I may have given everything that I have in sacrifice, and I go to sleep and
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.660]   wake up the next day and realize I need to give another sacrifice.
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.580]   And there wasn't enough sacrifices to be made, even the animal sacrifices to cover
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.020]   all of my sins.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:53.140]   And all of this for us, for me, to recognize that the curse is being built up, the debt
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:27:00.420]   for my sins is being built up generation to generation to generation to generation.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:08.420]   And then Christ says, "I died so that your debt may be paid," right?
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.860]   That alone, right?
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:17.180]   If you had sentenced to jail for the rest of your life and somebody says, "You're free,
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:20.700]   your debt's been paid," that would be enough.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.820]   Even if you didn't go to jail and you were homeless the rest of your life, at least you're
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.180]   free.
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.080]   But God's love doesn't stop there.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:35.060]   He said not only does He forgive us our debt, He says those who have been called may receive
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:38.540]   the promise of eternal inheritance.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.500]   And then He describes why and how that happened.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:47.740]   Verse 16, "For where a covenant is, there must be of necessity be the death of the one
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:48.740]   who made it."
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.740]   Okay?
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.740]   So stop right there.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:55.260]   This is the place where you really need to slow down and ask questions.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.320]   Because the reason for the atonement that's described here is not something that you can
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.220]   just kind of skim through.
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:07.980]   Why did somebody need to die in order for the covenant to be effective?
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.460]   You need to be asking these questions.
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.540]   That's why we do inductive Bible study, right?
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:17.180]   He says here, "For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.380]   who made it.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.460]   For a covenant is valid only when men are dead."
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:25.060]   Does that make sense?
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.060]   Okay.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:31.220]   "For it is never in force while the one who made it lives."
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.620]   Do you understand that?
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.460]   Okay.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:39.020]   I hope you say you didn't because I don't think you do.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.020]   Because this requires a little bit of digging.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:50.260]   Why would a covenant only be valid if the one who made it has to die?
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.260]   Is it too early?
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.060]   Right?
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.740]   This is not something that you can just skim through.
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:00.000]   In fact, if you do inductive Bible study, you'll find that the word for covenant here
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.100]   is translated differently in different texts.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:08.180]   In the NIV, ESV, it is translated "will."
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.720]   In some, in the NASB, it's translated "covenant."
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.180]   In some of the other translations, it will use some other word.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:20.300]   And the reason why there's different words used here is because the normal word for covenant
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.940]   used in the New Testament is "sun-theke."
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.900]   And that is used 99% of the time, that word is used, "sun-theke," whenever you see the
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.540]   word covenant.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:34.700]   But here, the word that is used is "diatheke."
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.260]   So there's a lot of debate as to how we are to understand this word "diatheke."
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:43.260]   Why is "diatheke" used here in reference to covenant?
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.680]   Right?
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:49.160]   Because the meaning behind this is a lot more specific.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.560]   Because the word "sun-theke" has a reference to two parties coming together and making
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.220]   an agreement.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:30:00.300]   That they would cut an animal, that they would walk through it, if either of you break this
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.140]   covenant, may this happen to you.
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:06.940]   So the covenant is alive when the two people are alive, not dead.
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.660]   Does that make sense?
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.960]   In fact, the covenant gets broken if they die.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:17.500]   But here it says the covenant is only useful if they're dead.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.300]   Are you following?
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.660]   Because some of you are not.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.060]   So if you're not, ask somebody, okay?
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.420]   After the Bible study, because this is important.
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.420]   In order to understand this text, you need to follow what I'm saying, okay?
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.460]   Hopefully you are with me, okay?
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:37.060]   If not, it's recorded, okay?
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:42.920]   The word "sun-theke," okay, is not used here, but the word "diatheke."
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:48.900]   And the reason why that word is used is because that word is more in reference to a specific
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:54.580]   aspect of the covenant, more like a will.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.340]   A will is more of a unilateral decision.
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:03.420]   So if I was to write a will for my children, I don't make an agreement with my kids.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:08.380]   When I die, you get this, right?
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:15.100]   So that covenant that I made will only be effective when I'm gone.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.660]   Do you understand?
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:18.660]   Yes?
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.660]   Okay, so you get it, okay.
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.100]   Alright, some of you guys who have bigger eyes, I can see.
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:28.500]   Others of you, I have no idea with your face expression, okay?
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:35.860]   So the point that he's trying to make is not only did he forgive sins by his death, he
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:45.220]   says by his death, he fulfilled the promise that he made to the nation of Israel.
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.740]   The promise that he made to the nation of Israel, Genesis chapter 12, 1 to 3, "Now
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:53.380]   the Lord said to Abram, 'Go forth from your country and from your relatives and from your
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.900]   father's house to the land which I will show you.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:01.180]   And I will make you a great nation and I will bless you and make your name great and you
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.580]   shall be a blessing and I will bless those who bless you and the one who curses you I
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:09.780]   will curse and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.'"
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:17.560]   That was, was that a, was that a, was that a, like a covenant between Israel and God?
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:22.540]   Or was that a unilateral covenant?
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.540]   Which is it?
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:24.540]   Yes.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:35.540]   Hey, you're not obeying the law, you got to cover your mouth.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:40.740]   It's a unilateral covenant, right?
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:46.260]   God is telling the nation of Israel, "I will do this."
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:51.560]   Now when he gave the Mosaic Law, he said, "If you do this, I will do this.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.540]   If you do this, I will do that."
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:58.400]   And so the word "suntheke" is more of a description of an agreement of two parties.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.860]   But the covenant that God made to the nation of Israel is bigger than the covenant that
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:04.860]   he made with Moses.
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.200]   Does that make sense?
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:15.860]   So even though the nation of Israel broke the "suntheke," God is remaining faithful
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.260]   to "diateke."
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:23.800]   And because he made this unilateral covenant with the nation of Israel, he is remaining
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.120]   faithful to himself.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:34.620]   And so not only did he forgive them of their sins, by dying he fulfilled the promise that
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.500]   he makes.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.560]   Think about that.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.940]   Think about that.
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:51.300]   Think about how hard it is for us to forgive somebody who hurt us.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:59.660]   Think about how difficult it is when you feel like somebody slandered you and hurt you,
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:10.860]   to not to retaliate, let alone to be forgiving, but to offer your son so that they may be
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.060]   elevated.
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.800]   That's how the gospel is described.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.020]   That that's what he did.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.720]   See, he made that promise to the nation of Israel.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.820]   There are a lot of people who think today that Israel is done.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.820]   When the church showed up, God made a promise to the nation of Israel, but because of their
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:32.400]   sins, God moved on, and then now he focuses all his attention to the church.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.520]   That's not what the Bible teaches.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.700]   And again, that's the distinction between infant baptism and believer's baptism.
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:42.700]   For those of you who are confused, and if it went over your head, again, you know, this
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:46.940]   is one of those things that requires some digging, right?
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:51.380]   God remains faithful to his promise to the nation of Israel.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.940]   He says in Romans 11, 1 through 2, "I say then, God has not rejected his people, has
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.260]   he?
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.960]   May it never be."
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.960]   This is in Romans.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.940]   This is not in Old Testament.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.740]   This is after his death and resurrection.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.060]   He says, "May it never be.
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:14.060]   For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin.
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.460]   God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew."
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:24.260]   Again, in Romans 11, verses 11 and 12, "I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall,
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.260]   did they?
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.840]   May it never be.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:32.220]   But by their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles, so to make them jealous."
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:36.140]   Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:40.700]   Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be?
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:47.460]   Again, you may not understand the impact of all of this because I surely did not when
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.140]   I was in seminary.
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.180]   You know, when I was studying all this, I just took it and I took the test and I got
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:57.740]   the answer right, but it took years where this really started sinking in, what this
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:59.420]   means.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:04.740]   Romans chapter 11, verse 26, "And so all Israel will be saved, just as it is written, the
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:09.020]   deliverer will come from Zion, he will remove ungodliness from Jacob.
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.540]   This is my covenant with them when I take away their sins."
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:19.580]   So Romans makes it very clear that God's not done with Israel, that he's going to keep
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:26.580]   his promise that he made to the nation of Israel, deatheke, that he's going to give
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:32.220]   them the inheritance that he promised, that even though for a period they experienced
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:38.020]   a hardening of their heart and now we're living in a period of the Gentiles, meaning the church,
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:42.780]   but when the fullness of Gentiles has come in, he says God will bring Israel back into
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:47.980]   the fold, that they're going to experience revival and he's going to fulfill the inheritance
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.000]   he promised to the nation of Israel.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.940]   So when we look at heaven, the picture of heaven that's described for us in Revelations
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:01.980]   chapter 7, and this is a picture of heaven that John sees, and I heard the number of
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:09.240]   those who are sealed, 144,000 sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel, right?
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:14.740]   So he distinguishes, he doesn't just describe a universal church, he describes first the
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.380]   Israelites that he sees.
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:22.260]   And then right behind them in Revelations chapter 7, 9 through 10, "After these things
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:27.340]   I looked and behold a great multitude which no one could count from every nation and all
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:31.240]   the tribes of the people and towns standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:35.700]   in white robes and palm branches were in their hands and crying out with a loud voice saying,
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:43.100]   'Salvation to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb.'"
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.100]   Who cares?
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:50.060]   I hope you're not saying that because this is huge.
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:38:03.480]   The reason why this is huge, even after all these years, even after all their failures,
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:12.320]   even after all their rebellion, even after generations and decades and multitudes of
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:19.040]   God's faithfulness to the nation of Israel, they have hardened their heart against God
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:24.640]   and they have become a stumbling block to the gospel and God would have every right
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:31.020]   to have cut them off millenniums ago.
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:39.400]   And yet because God made a promise, he says he will fulfill it.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.160]   Now you know why that's so huge?
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.040]   You know why that's so important?
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:53.880]   Because what he does with the nation of Israel is what he does with us.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:39:01.840]   All of that is a reflection of who he is, how he treats the nation of Israel because
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:07.020]   he made a diethike, because he committed in his own heart, and that's why he keeps saying
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:11.320]   over and over again, "For my glory."
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.000]   He says, "I will be faithful.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.880]   I will remain faithful to myself."
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:27.440]   And you know when he says that, he's saying the promise that he made, that he will fulfill.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:32.160]   So if he said it, he will not change his mind.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.280]   He will not be thwarted.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:38.240]   Not by me and not by you.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.240]   That's who he is.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:44.740]   And that's why he says in Hebrews 6, 17 to 20, "In the same way, God desiring men even
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:50.480]   more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose interposed
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.560]   with an oath so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie,
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.860]   we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:07.480]   before us, this hope we have as an anchor of the soul."
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.000]   This hope we have as an anchor for the soul.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:17.080]   A hope both sure and steadfast and one which enters within the veil where Jesus has entered
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:23.880]   as a forerunner for us having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.480]   Wow.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.040]   Wow.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:36.680]   God hasn't let go of his people yet.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:48.760]   Think about, think about even after you became a Christian, the sins you've committed.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:56.040]   Think about the sins you committed before you came to church today.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.440]   Think about the sin just this week.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:05.760]   Now I know we all dressed up nicely, brushed our teeth, combed our hair, you know, we put
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:13.840]   our best foot forward, we grabbed our Bibles and we're sitting nicely, you know.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:19.800]   But you know, you know the sins in your heart.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   You know the bitterness that you walk with.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:30.680]   You know the pornography that you wrestle with and you're trying so hard to overcome.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:36.040]   You know the anger that you have, people that you can't forgive.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:41.720]   These are all sins that are rebellion against God.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:48.060]   And he knew that the only hope that you and I have for these sins is the blood sacrifice
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:51.760]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:59.080]   And as he is faithful to the nation of Israel, he is faithful to us.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:03.000]   That's why we need to anchor in Christ.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.400]   That's why we need to anchor in Christ.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:09.520]   Anchoring Christ doesn't mean I'm going to try harder.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.960]   Anchoring Christ is not simply saying like I'm going to read my Bible more.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:17.680]   Although that may be an application of that.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.540]   Anchoring Christ is recognizing who he is.
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:28.200]   And the only hope that we have, especially now, especially now, where the world is running
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.600]   around, who do we trust?
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.240]   Who do we believe?
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:38.360]   Where do we put our hope that the Christians don't get on that same boat?
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.800]   That our hope is anchored in Christ.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.720]   He is the same yesterday, today, and forevermore.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:51.120]   Let's pray.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:58.080]   Heavenly Father, you are God beyond comprehension.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.080]   Why do you care?
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.680]   Why do you care?
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.520]   You know our rebellion.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:11.060]   You know our hearts, how easily we drift, how easily we get entangled with the affairs
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:15.240]   of this world.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:20.960]   Help us, Lord God, to be anchored in the confidence in Christ and the promises that he's given
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:27.120]   in the blood atonement, Lord God, that cleanses us from our sins, that gives us hope for eternity.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:32.900]   Help us, Lord, to take our eyes off of this temporary world, that we may be able to express
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.800]   our love and joy to you today, tomorrow, and forevermore.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
