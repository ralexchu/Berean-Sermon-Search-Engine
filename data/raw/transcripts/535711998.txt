[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.300]   Hello, my name is Jamie, and I am a junior in high school in the youth ministry.
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.580]   This is my testimony of how God has worked in my life.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.520]   I was born in New York and was a pretty big troublemaker as a kid.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.480]   I grew up going to church every Sunday with parents who were faithfully serving the Lord.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.600]   At a young age, I heard the gospel, but it had no personal meaning to me.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.920]   My family moved to Maryland when I was in third grade, and when I was around eight or
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.440]   nine I was exposed to lustful things by a friend, and I quickly grew an addiction.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.360]   Along with this, other sins opened up in my heart, such as lying and deceiving my parents
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.440]   and always talking about lustful things.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.000]   I indulged in these things for about a year.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.200]   I felt a little bit ashamed for my sins, but I was also clueless at the same time and did
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.520]   not realize the extent to how sinful my actions were.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.240]   About a year later, my mom caught me in one of my lies.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.440]   This led her to ask me, "What else have you been hiding?"
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.560]   I confessed to her my lust problem as well as many other things I had been hiding and
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.400]   lying about for the past year.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.480]   While confessing felt like a huge weight was lifted off my heart, I still did not understand
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.240]   how wretched of a sinner I was before God and how much I needed salvation.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.160]   But I could see how grieved my parents were that at such a young age my heart was so full
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.040]   of sin.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.080]   It was at this point that I started to look to God through prayer and reading His word
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.320]   more seriously.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.480]   A lot of things changed in my life, but for the wrong reasons.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.360]   I did not struggle with lust as much and became a better behaved kid, but these were just
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.080]   to please my parents who I had grieved a lot.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.160]   It was clear that I still did not have a relationship with God.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.160]   Two years later in seventh grade, I was at a retreat where a lot of people gave their
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.680]   testimonies.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.400]   It was a blessing for me to hear about God's work in these people's lives.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.800]   After this retreat, I came away with a sense of desperation, realizing that my fate was
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.340]   to end up in hell, separated from God.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.640]   I thought about how miserable and unfulfilling life would be if I continued to live in sin
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.560]   as I already had been up to that point.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.760]   God showed me how true life and joy outside of Him was impossible.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.560]   A few days after the retreat, I repented of my sins and Christ came to my heart.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.640]   For the first time, Christ's love through the cross became real to me and I had peace.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.760]   I felt so much gratitude to God knowing how much grace He had poured out on me.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.760]   There have been trials that tested my faith to prove its genuineness.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.160]   In 2017, my family abruptly left our home church and moved out to California a few months
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.700]   later to a new church with a different culture.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.160]   My parents said that the old church and its teachings were no longer following God.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.480]   This really shook my faith and for a while, I struggled in my relationship with God.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.160]   I had a hard time understanding why God would lead us out of the church where I had first
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.640]   come to salvation and grown.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.200]   But by God's grace, especially during the last several months of COVID, He gave me a
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   growing desire to know Him more.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   I now see how Christ used the struggle I had to show me more clearly the treasure I have
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.760]   in Christ.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.600]   He has shown me that no matter the circumstances or hardships, He is the same unchanging God
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.000]   and is always worthy of my worship and all that I am.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.340]   One passage that applies to my life is Titus 3, 3-7 which says, "For we also once were
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:29.000]   foolish ourselves, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.280]   our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.840]   But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared, He saved us,
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.920]   not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.200]   by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out upon
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.480]   us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by His grace, we would
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.760]   be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.880]   I am so grateful to God for the mercy He poured out on me through Jesus Christ.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.120]   I am the person that these verses speak about, foolish, disobedient, and enslaved to my lusts
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.600]   and pleasures, but purely by God's grace can I stand before Him righteous in His eyes.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.400]   I continue to battle my flesh every day, but my prayer for myself is that I grow spiritually
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.120]   daily and never forget what Christ has done for me and live this new life to glorify Him.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.120]   Thank you.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.120]   [Applause]
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:59.280]   >> Thank you for your testimony.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.680]   We understand that when you go into the water, you are united with Christ in His death.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.280]   When you come out of the water, you are united with Christ in His resurrection so that you
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.280]   can walk in human delight.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.280]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:28.280]   [Applause]
