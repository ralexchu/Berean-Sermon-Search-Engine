[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160]   Let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer, asking the Spirit to help us.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:18.040]   Lord, Lord God, we in each week pray for you to bless us through your Word.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.480]   And God, we want to absolutely acknowledge that we have not made it.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.520]   Lord, there is various aspects of us that are so deeply stained with sin.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.880]   Lord God, each one of us has felt the frustration of not seeing growth, not seeing certain sins
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.680]   be completely removed.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.320]   But Father God, I pray, Lord, that that would not hinder us from learning all the more.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.720]   And especially tonight, again, as we look at your Word, would you help us to be washed?
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.960]   Would you help us to be inspired and strengthened with your truth?
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.320]   Knowing full well, Father God, that apart from your truth, apart from your Spirit, our
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.320]   flesh is so weak.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.320]   Our hearts are weak.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.040]   Our minds are weak.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.560]   And so God, we request and pray that your Spirit would help us in the reading and in
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.560]   the study of your Word.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.920]   This we pray in Christ's name, amen.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920]   Okay.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.920]   Let's take a look at this passage together.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:27.160]   And before I read the passage, I want to go through a quick review and kind of introductory
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.960]   remarks.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.720]   And I want to recall with you guys that, remember, Apostle Paul has been actually giving various
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.440]   commands in previous sections.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.960]   And if you remember, Apostle Paul, from the beginning of the letter, has been trying to
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960]   give his perspective.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.240]   He's been giving his observation and interpretation about all that's happening in his life, which
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.120]   makes sense of the suffering, the persecution, his current imprisonment.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.560]   And remember, he asked, you know, he challenged the church to make his joy complete by being
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.720]   of the same mind, meaning having that same perspective, maintaining the same love, united
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.960]   in spirit, and tend on one purpose, do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.120]   humility of mind, regard one another as more important than yourselves.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.000]   Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.640]   Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.640]   Okay?
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.760]   So recall that already there was a previous command for us to have a certain attitude.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.120]   And then later on, he said, "Join me in this great joy."
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.920]   What he said was, "Even if I'm being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.920]   and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.080]   You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me."
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.040]   And if you recall, I said, when he says this, he is talking about his entire worldview,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.440]   which says, "My joy is to have Christ exalted.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.320]   Whether in life or by death, if Christ is proclaimed, I'm happy."
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.320]   Right?
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.800]   That was his interpretation and judgment of everything.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.760]   And so, in the very last passage that we studied the previous week, he continued to expound
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.560]   upon his goal, that what he wants is to know the power of his resurrection, Jesus' resurrection,
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.080]   the fellowship of his suffering, becoming like him the whole way through death, only
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.720]   so that he may obtain the power of the resurrection of Christ.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.880]   And if you recall, the way I summarized it was, all the way Jesus, right?
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.760]   He wants to know every part of Christ.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.400]   Now, I do this review with you guys because the section that we're at now is an exhortational
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.080]   section that summarizes a lot.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.400]   Yes?
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.760]   When he says, you know, "Press on.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.000]   I haven't obtained it yet," and all this kind of stuff, he's actually summarizing a lot.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.160]   And so, therefore, we had to do a little bit of a review, thinking through all the various
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.840]   perspectives and worldview that Apostle Paul has.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.080]   Now, I would like to make a quick comment about Bible study, that sometimes when you
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:25.960]   come across an exhortational passage like this, you can still do very close observations.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.600]   So you're asking the questions about, "What does he mean by obtain?
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.120]   Why does he say obtain when this is stuff that we are given as a gift?
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.120]   You know, what is it?
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.120]   Why does…
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.120]   We should do that."
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.400]   However, the exhortation was pretty clear.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   It's repetitive.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.560]   It's really repetitive, right?
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.120]   And so, these are moments when you should be thinking, "Hmm, this is highly applicational.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.560]   Do I conceptually understand what he wants me to apply?
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.120]   And when he uses these words, do I understand what they mean, right?
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.080]   Am I thinking like Apostle Paul in this?"
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.400]   And so, you should be thinking like, "Have I already seen this applied in a certain way
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.920]   in my own life?
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.920]   Do I…
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.760]   Do we as a community understand…
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.800]   Do we as a community understand how this should be applied?"
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.360]   So, the thought should really meditate upon application and to understand, "Do I know
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.040]   even what and how I'm supposed to apply this?"
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.960]   Now, in thinking about that, okay, in thinking about that, I want us to now read the passage.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.800]   So, let's turn to our little packet of hand out there, and I'll read that for us.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.200]   It says, "Not that I have already obtained it or have already become perfect, but I press
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.640]   on so that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.720]   Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet, but one thing I do, forgetting
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.760]   what lies behind, reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.200]   the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.000]   Let us, therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.360]   And if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.000]   However, let us keep living by that same standard to which we have attained."
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Okay?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.720]   Now, I'm going to ask this question, "What is the summary, main exhortation of this passage?"
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.040]   I just finished saying this is a very exhortational thing and it's very repetitive.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.440]   In first sight, we may think that the challenge is persevere, press on.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.800]   You're not there yet.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.360]   Go, right?
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:46.000]   But actually, I think it's more so at the bottom where it says, "Have this attitude."
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Okay?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.600]   It says, "Let us keep living."
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   Right?
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.520]   Yes, he does repeat the words, "Press on, press on."
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.840]   But the way I'd like to summarize this for you is, there is this outline I want to give
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:05.560]   to you, is that Apostle Paul in verse 12 through 14 is showing you a self-example again of
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.560]   his mentality.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.120]   It started in chapter 3, verse 1, where he talked about...
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.640]   Oh, it's flickering, huh?
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.920]   I'm going to do an old school trick.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   Okay.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.920]   Let's see if that works.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.920]   You guys know what I'm talking about?
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.920]   Okay.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.920]   Let's see if that works.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.920]   Please.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.920]   It also could be...
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   Did it go?
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.920]   Not quite, huh?
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.920]   Yay.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.920]   Nope, that's not what I wanted.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.920]   Okay.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.920]   We're here.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.920]   Okay.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.920]   I'm not going to touch it.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.920]   Okay.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   So, Apostle Paul is showing us his mentality, which started in chapter 3, verse 1 through
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.920]   11.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.280]   And he's actually saying in verse 15, the exhortation comes strong, not just this expectation
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.960]   like you better go, you better not quit, but he's actually saying, no, I want you to have
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:23.680]   this whole perspective, understanding that you're not there yet, this humility that you're
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.440]   not perfect, but pressing on towards the goal that God has given you and has called you
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.440]   to.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.200]   That whole entire mentality I want you to have.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.200]   That's the exhortation.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.200]   Okay?
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   All right.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.320]   So, then let's jump in and break that down.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   Part one.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.840]   The first part of that is his mentality is not yet.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.000]   Okay?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.320]   Not yet.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.680]   And what we have here, I highlighted it for you, it says, not that I've already obtained
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.000]   it or I've already become perfect.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.600]   That's what he says in verse 12.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.720]   And then he repeats the idea in verse 13, brethren, I do not regard myself as having
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.280]   laid hold of it yet.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.720]   And therefore, we see this reiterated concept like I'm not there yet.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.720]   Right?
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.160]   Like I haven't fully made it.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.160]   We get that.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.520]   Now, the important question is, what is it?
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.160]   And I ask you this question.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.960]   For the sake of time, I'm going to run through, perhaps in our table we discussed a couple
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.960]   of things.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.760]   It could be like, since he just finished saying that I want to fully understand Christ's experience,
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.880]   maybe he's talking about really understanding it all.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.880]   Right?
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.960]   Could it be a full knowledge of Jesus?
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.480]   Could it be simply the resurrection, which was his last thought in verse 11?
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.640]   Could it be perfection?
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.680]   Because in the immediate context, he actually parallels those two thoughts, right?
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:50.720]   When he says, I have not obtained it or have already become perfect.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.280]   Or is it later in verse 14 when he talks about this upward call?
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.960]   There's not going to be a way to say, no, this is it, right?
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.960]   Emphatically.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   However, you do typically operate off of what is the immediate context that you see
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.960]   it in.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:12.160]   What's more, you think about the idea of his use of the term perfection.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:18.780]   So in verse 12 when he says that I have not already obtained it or already have become
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.920]   perfect, that's the best indicator for you in the immediate context about what he could
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.960]   mean.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.960]   So let's think about that a little bit.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.640]   The apostle Paul says, I haven't become perfect yet.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:34.720]   And I want to show you this dictionary entry that the term really generally refers to a
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.040]   completeness, right?
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.280]   To make perfect by reaching its intended goal, right?
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.040]   So is it wrong for someone to say what he's talking about is not so much that he hasn't
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.200]   reached glorification, but that he's still in the process?
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.320]   He hasn't reached the end goal yet.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.640]   That's permissible.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.080]   Is he talking about the fact that he is not 100% in the maturity of Christ, meaning he's
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.800]   not in perfect conformity to the character of Jesus?
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.880]   That also could be it, right?
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.980]   Now in thinking about this though, I think what's important for us is remember thinking
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:18.880]   and reflecting how does this apply in the way that I'm thinking?
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.000]   Because I can't remember ever a time when I showed up and I was like, dang, look at
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.560]   you, like looking in the mirror and thinking you're perfect, right?
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.760]   How many of you guys ever done that?
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.580]   I'm guessing nobody, right?
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.520]   Or if you have, we need to talk.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.960]   We probably haven't.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.080]   So how do we do this?
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.300]   Like in what way?
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.300]   You should ask this question.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.300]   How does this apply?
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:47.460]   In what way have we in contrary fashion thought that we've already made it?
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:53.040]   What I'm going to say is type A. There is a type A where pride settles in.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.080]   You might not think that you're perfect.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.640]   You might not think that you're Jesus.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.320]   You might not think like you're Apostle Paul, right?
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.880]   But sometimes we think we're better than at least our community.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.720]   We've made it enough sometimes we think.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.720]   Like I've done enough.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.560]   I've done plenty, right?
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.220]   Sometimes we think, oh no.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.280]   For the viewers at home, I want to make sure this thing works, but I'm not sure what's
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.280]   going on.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.240]   You know, I've got another trick up my sleeve.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:27.600]   I'm going to jam my pencil in there and see if it holds it up.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.400]   Did it work?
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.840]   Oh, it is kind of working.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.960]   Yes, thank you.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.040]   So there is that kind of mentality that can catch up with you where you've been living
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.320]   your Christian life for a certain time and it's like sometimes there's this even subtle
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.680]   thought I don't need to read because I already know.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.760]   It's right here, man.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.440]   That's pretty arrogant if you think that way, okay?
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.160]   Sometimes I've caught myself where it's not so much that I think that I've already made
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:04.720]   it, but if someone is trying to teach me, it feels like, you know, there's just this
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.360]   weird resistance to someone pushing you more, right?
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.160]   And you know what's really interesting about this is when we started the study of Philippians,
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.720]   there was a passage I want to go to which was Philippians chapter 1, 6.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.720]   Please turn your Bibles over there really fast, okay?
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.080]   Philippians 1, 6.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.960]   And remember we started with this whole idea.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.240]   Apostle Paul's prayer for you was not, "I hope you have enough.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.280]   I hope that you do enough.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.280]   I hope that you serve enough.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.480]   I hope that you evangelize enough."
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.480]   No, that's not what he said.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.380]   He actually kept praying and he wanted to admonish them to do all the more.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.380]   So what does he say?
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:46.080]   Verse 6, he says this, "I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.480]   bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ."
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:57.840]   What's more, later on, he talks about, oh goodness, oh, later on in verse 10, "So that
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:03.200]   you may approve what is excellent and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.840]   filled with the spirit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.840]   praise of God."
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.200]   Right?
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:17.360]   Apostle Paul wants individuals to be filled and blameless before Jesus.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.760]   That is an incredible standard far above what we think is, "I think I did enough."
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.760]   Okay?
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.920]   And what's more, for the sake of time, we're not going to turn there, but 2 Peter 1, 3-9,
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.800]   that is a passage that says, you know what?
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.280]   If you think you have knowledge, you should add to that knowledge understanding.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.680]   If you think you have an understanding, then you should add to that diligence.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.440]   And if you have diligence, it just keeps going on and on and on about how we should be ever
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.440]   growing.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.700]   What am I talking about?
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:52.160]   If ever you've been tempted to think, "I'm at least ahead of the pack," God did not call
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.760]   you to that.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.400]   Right?
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:02.120]   Every single Christian should have this ever-growing hunger, "I want more of Christ in my life.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.080]   I want more of teaching because there's so much I don't know.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.320]   I know nothing yet."
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:14.040]   Every individual who's serving should be thinking, not to the hurtful way, but in a genuine desire,
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.400]   "I want to serve the Lord.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.760]   I want to exemplify Christ.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.720]   I want Him exalted, proclaimed.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.160]   I want more and more."
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.240]   And even if you're already loving, Scripture says, "I want you to abound even more in love."
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.240]   Right?
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.640]   You love in a way where nobody has to even teach you, but I want you to even abound more.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:38.480]   Christians, good and godly Christians, should be some of the most spiritually ambitious
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.600]   people around.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:47.620]   Does that sound weird to you when I say that, that Christians should be ambitious?
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:52.200]   Should Christians be in it to win it?
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.080]   And the answer is yes.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.920]   Remember Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians?
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.320]   Don't fight like you're just there.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.800]   Run like you're trying to win.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.640]   This passage is so exhortational and we need to hear it.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.760]   What's more, I think there's another way in which we have the wrong mentality and not
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:17.040]   the "I'm not there yet" mentality, which is the hopelessness mentality.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.320]   The "I'll never be there.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.240]   I'm never enough.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.240]   Doesn't matter who teaches me.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.360]   No one can help because I can't learn.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.920]   I can't even go.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.920]   I've already tried.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.040]   Failed too many times."
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:36.920]   You see, this kind of mentality is so incredibly dangerous because it absolutely diminishes
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.520]   what we're supposed to be thinking about the "not there yet."
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.160]   In reality, Jesus Christ is working in you and through you.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.560]   The Holy Spirit is deposited in you and has surrounded you.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:56.000]   And should we think that this, this kind of mentality is the sum conclusion of that power
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.400]   working in us, we don't understand the "not yet."
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.280]   I think when Apostle Paul is saying "not yet," he's saying so much more than "Oh, goodness,
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.960]   woe is me."
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.880]   That's not what he's saying, right?
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.360]   So that's part one.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.400]   Apostle Paul says, "Not yet."
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.720]   Part two, he says, "I press on."
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.000]   So clearly already you see parallel, right?
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.320]   Verse 12 and then verse 13 and 14, you see a parallel of Apostle Paul reiterating the
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.040]   same concepts in different fashion.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:32.240]   Right smack in the middle of his sentences, he says, "I press on so that I may lay hold
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.680]   of that."
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:38.640]   Verse 13, "Forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.360]   on towards the goal."
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.200]   So likewise, we want to do a quick word study and ask him the question, "What does Apostle
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.520]   Paul mean when he says 'press on'?"
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.520]   Okay?
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.400]   Excuse me.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:56.040]   So this term here, when he says "press on," I wanted to highlight it because we should
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.080]   get from his words a visual image.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:06.240]   When Apostle Paul uses this, the definition, the most frequent used definition is to move
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.480]   quickly, energetically towards something of an objective.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.060]   You're literally trying to go and get something, right?
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.360]   You pressing on isn't just like, "Oh, it's hard, but I'm walking," right?
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.840]   "I'm slowly walking there," right?
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.840]   It's actually, there is an urgency.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.720]   You're rushing to go grab that objective you have, right?
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.040]   And for those of us who love sports, we get the whole imagery.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.200]   It's like, man, if the ball's in the air and you're a receiver, go get it.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.280]   You don't sit there and wait for it to come to you.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.000]   Go get it, right?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.040]   That should be the mentality.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:47.000]   So we know that Apostle Paul uses this kind of terminology and has that same concept in
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.880]   other passages as well.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.560]   1 Timothy 6, verse 12, "Fight the good fight of faith.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:58.600]   Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you made the good confession
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.900]   in the presence of many witnesses."
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:06.480]   I use this term, and what I want to highlight for you is this term here, "take hold."
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.800]   There's a pen.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   Okay?
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.320]   "Take hold," okay?
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.760]   Because the press on idea, he's going to repeat in the attain and hold idea, okay?
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.400]   Do you like my pen skills?
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.400]   All right.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.160]   The next passage is 1 Timothy 6, "Instruct those who are rich in this present world not
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.080]   to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.760]   supplies us with all things to enjoy.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.560]   Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.960]   storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that,"
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:48.200]   take a look at this, "they may take hold of that which is life indeed."
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:54.960]   So when you look at this passage, and it talks about pressing on, so that I may hold, and
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:02.320]   he uses that again, we realize there is actually an incredible sense of energy and urgency.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.080]   He wants you to have this mentality of, "I am literally reaching forward to grab the
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.240]   prize," okay?
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.240]   When I talk about this, you know, there was a part of me that wondered, like, "Man, I
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.800]   honestly, I've never really been a coach.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:22.040]   I don't know how to be like, 'Come on, guys, let's do it!'"
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:26.560]   My temperament is not like that, you know, and it's just going to be awkward.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.620]   But part of me, I was thinking, like, "But that's what I should do."
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:35.720]   Because what Apostle Paul is doing is saying, "Look, look at the mentality that I have.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.440]   I'm taking initiative.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.280]   I know I haven't made it yet.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.960]   I know I'm not perfect, right?
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.280]   I haven't been completed yet."
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:51.080]   Rather than that being a discourage to me, that is a huge, huge challenge and impetus
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:57.960]   for me to have this desire to not sit back passively.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:05.320]   And honestly speaking, I think right now, you know, if I want to think about our generation,
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   there is an incredible amount of passivity.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.440]   We're constantly waiting for somebody else to go and lead the way.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.320]   We're constantly waiting for somebody else to pave the path.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.720]   We're constantly waiting, like, "Who's going to take care of this problem?
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.920]   Who's going to do this issue?
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.680]   Who's going to do that?"
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:29.200]   And honestly speaking, there should be in us a great, great challenge to what the passage
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.680]   says to both press on and to lay hold.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.680]   Okay.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:39.560]   Now, as I say that, what's very interesting is I believe what Apostle Paul meant for an
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:46.040]   added impetus, an added encouragement to that sometimes is confusing, which is the whole
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.840]   balance between our work and Christ's work.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.240]   So I ask you that question, how does this passage address it?
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.680]   How does this passage speak to that issue a little bit?
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.000]   And you see it right away, right?
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.040]   You see that he says, "I press on so that I may lay hold of that," and then he says,
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.320]   "But Christ already held me," right?
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:12.080]   I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus for this.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:17.000]   And what's more, I'm, like, pressing forward and I'm reaching ahead, but God already called
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   me to this.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.920]   Did you guys catch that?
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:25.320]   And so those two parallel constructions have both elements in there, right?
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.080]   Now, I wanted to give some diagrams because I was like, "Oh, cool.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.560]   PowerPoint can show you these cool diagrams," right?
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:39.960]   For us, I think our problem is that we regularly think in zero-sum game, meaning if I'm doing
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.840]   the holding, then he's not.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.000]   If he's doing the holding, then I'm not.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.680]   Who's doing the holding, right?
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.600]   But remember, God does not have to operate on our linear path.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.440]   It doesn't have to be a zero-sum game, okay?
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.240]   What's really interesting, though, I thought about this for a little bit, and I started
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.400]   for some reason thinking back to when I was young, when I first became Christian.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.680]   And what's really interesting is somebody actually explained it to me this way.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:08.720]   What happens is Jesus worked, and he set into motion your work.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:16.160]   So that's what it is, is he put you into motion and he released you, and now you must go and
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.000]   fulfill his plan, right?
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.080]   Have you guys ever heard that kind of preaching?
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.120]   That's the way I learned it when I was younger.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.420]   When I would sometimes visit other churches or visit other places, they actually had it
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.420]   even the other way.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.440]   They were like, "You need to work because God helps those who work."
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.240]   Have you guys ever heard that?
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.040]   God helps the people who help themselves.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.320]   And I was like, "Yeah, that sounds right."
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.440]   And then later I learned the Bible, I was like, "That's pretty off."
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.800]   I don't think that's right.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:50.760]   What the Scripture says is there is this power exerted by God where he has unified you with
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.760]   Christ.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.760]   You're one, right?
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.840]   That's what the Scripture says.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:04.060]   For your later encouragement, read John chapter 17, which is Jesus' high priestly prayer.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:10.680]   I love it because what Jesus prays is not, "God, do this so that they are empowered to
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.620]   go reach the ends of the earth."
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.620]   You know what he says?
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:19.800]   He says, "God, protect and keep these people in your name.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.440]   And just like I'm in you, keep them in you.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.660]   You in me, I in you, they in me, we would be one."
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.660]   You guys remember that?
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.680]   It's amazing.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:35.640]   There is this incredible power of God that causes us to be spiritually united with Christ
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:40.900]   where he says, "It is me working in you and through you."
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:45.740]   And then the apostle Paul says in Galatians, "It's no longer I who even live.
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:46.740]   It's Christ."
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:47.740]   Where?
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.740]   "In me."
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.620]   So if you notice, I hid this little you in there.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.980]   That's my diagram for you guys for today.
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.860]   I hope you are encouraged and left uplifted by all that.
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:05.000]   The reason why this all matters is because for some people, hearing about Christ's sovereignty
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.140]   in his work, because it's all confusing, they're just kind of like, "I don't know what to do
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.340]   with that."
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:16.900]   And they lose out on this incredible, incredible opportunity, I would say, or foundation is
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:26.140]   better word, incredible theological truth that's supposed to empower you to press on.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:32.460]   Because you operate by your human eyes and you're not seeing the incredible power that's
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:39.300]   not just simply around you working your circumstance, it's with you.
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.580]   That's the spiritual truth.
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.660]   Christ is in you and you are in Christ.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:49.220]   And so when Apostle Paul is going to then say, "This is how I press on," we should be
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.920]   absolutely uplifted by that.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:58.980]   And so he says, "I press on," and what's really interesting about all this is after that then
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.980]   he...
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:00.980]   Oh, sorry.
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.980]   After that then he gives this major exhortation in part three.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:09.620]   "Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude."
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:14.900]   And remember, here the exhortation is not simply, "You know what?
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:15.900]   You need to go.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.340]   I know you hit a wall, but just suck it up and do it," right?
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:25.960]   No, actually there's so much more than the biblical challenge to that, because your exhortation
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:32.340]   of fighting and working and laboring is never outside of the context of the sovereignty
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.300]   of God.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:39.500]   And the reality is, yes, you're not perfect, but rather than being all discouraged by that,
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:43.220]   Apostle Paul is saying, "I want you to have this attitude."
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.660]   Now ask this question.
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.900]   Verse 15 through 16 reads really different in the ESV.
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.980]   Does someone have that still?
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.460]   Like someone still using the ESV Bible?
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.860]   I'm sure a good number of you guys are, right?
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.840]   Can someone read that out loud for us and then kind of highlight what do you think is
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.540]   the key differences there?
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.980]   Brave soul, raise your hand.
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.780]   Thank you, Nathan.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.260]   You can't point to somebody else.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.620]   You do it.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:21.620]   So passive, right?
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:29.620]   Excellent.
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:34.260]   So you notice there he says, rather than just simply saying, "Hey, have this attitude,"
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.420]   he says, "Actually think this way," right?
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.980]   I ask you this interesting question.
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.400]   What is attitude?
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.260]   Is it when you stub your toe in the morning and you're like, "Great, this is going to
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.580]   be a horrible day," and then you get to work and then you're just grumpy?
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.580]   Is that attitude?
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.100]   Could be, yes.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:57.420]   What's really interesting is the word for attitude here, the most common definition
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.220]   is to employ one's faculty for thoughtful planning.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.400]   Kind of different than maybe what we think of attitude, right?
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.100]   Maybe we think of attitude as just like you're frowning.
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.740]   It's like, "Hey, turn that frown upside down," right?
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.860]   Your attitude is just typically your feelings, right?
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.700]   Your disposition of how you feel that day.
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.180]   It's just like, "Oh, it's a gloomy day.
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.300]   I'm all gloomy and stuff."
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:23.980]   But actually the scriptures talk about it as you need to think in this pattern.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:31.620]   You need to exercise your God-given ability to think by the truths that God has given
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.620]   you, by what you understand, right?
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:36.620]   Please.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.620]   Okay.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:45.100]   Now, this is super important because as you guys know, I regularly kind of talk about
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:50.300]   arenas where I think it's really helpful to people on a day-to-day basis.
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.820]   Remember how I showed you this?
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.700]   Okay.
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:29:03.300]   When I have somebody who says this, I believe they are in a judgment of their lives.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.660]   Now, I said that in a very purposeful way.
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.180]   What I mean by is this.
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:14.340]   These things that people say where I'm already there, I'll never be there, those are conclusive
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.820]   judgments about me.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.780]   So in my perspective, attitude is a judgment.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.940]   This is what needs to happen.
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:29.140]   Apostle Paul, when he has this mindset, a worldview, an attitude, he has a judgment.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.540]   And what he said was, "You know what I observe?
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:35.940]   I observe that I've been saved by the Messiah, the Lord of all.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:41.060]   The Son of God has saved me, me, the greatest of all sinners, and he's given me the incredible
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:46.300]   privilege to proclaim his name, to exalt his glory.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.300]   So I'm suffering.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.500]   I observe that.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.540]   But I don't interpret this as bad.
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.260]   I conclude this is good.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.780]   I am where I should be."
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.240]   That's his judgment.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:03.060]   We all exercise the faculty, our mental faculty of planning and thinking.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:08.500]   And what we do is we observe, we interpret, and then we judge.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.780]   Your attitude is your judgment.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:16.780]   And what needs to happen is you have to surrender that to God.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:23.900]   If you are in here struggling with this downcast attitude, "My life is horrible.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.700]   I'm never going to get there.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.500]   I've fallen too many times.
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.940]   I can't learn.
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.860]   I can't move from here.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.820]   He's telling me to grow and persevere, and I just can't.
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.260]   I don't have the strength for that."
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:41.860]   Understand some of that is, yes, you're just discouraged.
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.260]   Some of that you just need some more hope.
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.780]   But some of that is a pattern of you observing some things about yourself, interpreting it
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:54.660]   according to your own wisdom, and then concluding and judging yourself.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.620]   You do not have the authority.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.500]   You have to surrender that.
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.500]   Let me give you an example.
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.500]   Right?
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.500]   Let's say Elder Joe is right here.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.860]   I'm just going to use you as an example because you're right there.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.780]   And let's say one of his children were just like right here, right in front of me, you
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:10.780]   know?
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.000]   And then, you know, they're just like, "Oh, my goodness, so cute.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.220]   He looks just like you."
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.420]   And you know, his babies, when they were babies, they were like plump, right?
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:23.060]   It's like, "Oh, my gosh, he's so plump and supple and so cute.
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.820]   I just want to squeeze his cheeks," right?
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:30.340]   He would feel honestly like happy, like, "Yeah, that's my son.
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.820]   He looks just like me," you know?
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:38.580]   But then imagine if, you know, Richard's right there, and I see his kid, and it's like, "Dude,
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.880]   he's like so huge, but in a gross way."
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.060]   And I started making all these weird comments, like, "Why is he like that?
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.540]   What a strange kid.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.540]   Who's son is..."
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.540]   You know, like, I started commenting like, "Oh, he's never going to make it.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.820]   He's going to be a runt.
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:53.820]   He's going to be a..."
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.060]   Imagine if I said that stuff, how would Richard feel?
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.580]   Right?
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:31:59.580]   He'd be pissed.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.980]   Like, "Who are you, dude?
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:02.980]   Learn to control your mouth.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.020]   You're not allowed to say that stuff about other people's kid," right?
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.020]   Why?
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.180]   Because that's his kid.
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.200]   The only difference is I'm a third party.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:18.060]   When you make judgments about yourself, that's you making judgments about someone who's not
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.980]   your own.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.740]   You're not your own.
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:25.900]   You've been purchased by the blood of Christ, and God calls you a child.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:30.380]   When you make those comments, think about the feelings of the father.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.500]   Yes?
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.980]   You don't have the authority to say that kind of stuff.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:41.540]   You don't have the authority to make those judgments of, "I will never be there."
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.760]   You don't have that authority.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:49.020]   What I found as I counsel people was that sometimes the reason why it's so hard to
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:55.100]   change attitude is because they have to surrender all of that judgment to God.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.580]   Right?
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.540]   You've got to surrender your observation, you've got to surrender your interpretation,
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.520]   and you also have to surrender your conclusion.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.380]   We have to learn to do this.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.380]   Why?
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.860]   Because exhortation is not, "Just go.
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:09.860]   I know you failed.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.860]   Just get up and go.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:11.860]   Press on."
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.580]   That's not the exhortation.
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.620]   The exhortation is have this attitude of humility.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.060]   I'm not there yet.
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:22.260]   I'm a work in progress that God is working on, and He's in me.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:26.460]   Have this mentality that you can persevere because God has enabled you, but He has enabled
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:33.380]   you in a sovereign way where He has already held you, and He has already called you.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.780]   Amen?
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.780]   That's the context in which we operate.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:42.820]   That's the confidence we have when Scripture tells you, "Press on."
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:48.980]   And so I want to conclude there that the Scripture says in this incredible fashion at the very
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.940]   end, verse 16, "Let us therefore," right?
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:57.180]   "Let us therefore keep living by the same."
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.900]   It says standard here, but it's really interesting.
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.660]   That word is not necessarily in the Greek.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:06.260]   That part of it's just in order to make it make sense, they added that.
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:11.300]   But the idea is, "Let us therefore live by the same standard to which we've attained
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.980]   already."
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.980]   God has held us.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:21.600]   God has sovereignly called us, and it is His desire for us to press on with that kind of,
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.060]   you can say, attitude.
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.340]   Let's just call it simplistically faith.
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:31.460]   When we're operating by all those truths, when we're operating by all of those convictions,
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:35.780]   all of those confidences in God, what we're doing is walking by faith.
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:36.780]   Amen?
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.620]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:44.220]   Lord, we want to thank you so much for your grace.
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:50.660]   And God, we thank you, Lord, that Christ has prayed for us, that we would be protected
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:55.780]   and guarded and kept in the name of God, the powerful name of God.
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:01.260]   And so therefore, with great security, with great assurance, Lord, when you call, then
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.260]   we'll follow.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.260]   Lord, when you give us this exhortation, we want to obey.
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:11.300]   And Lord, I pray for any individual who's discouraged, who is feeling hopeless, would
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:16.100]   you grant to them the great strength that comes from the power of your word, and what's
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:21.860]   more, the awareness of your spirit, the powerful spirit that's working in us and through us.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:27.680]   And I do pray, Father God, that, yes, we are so susceptible to living by our sight.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.380]   And Lord, that's very discouraging, because all we see is deficiency, weakness, and brokenness.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:38.100]   But God, we pray that we would walk by faith, looking forward to the great hope we have
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:43.540]   in Christ, looking forward to the great eternity in heaven, which you have prepared for us.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.180]   Lord, we thank you and love you.
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.180]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:46.180]   Amen.
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.000]   Amen.
