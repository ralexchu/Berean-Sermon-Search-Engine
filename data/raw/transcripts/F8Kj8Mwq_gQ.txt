[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:21.140]   - All right, good morning, church family.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.380]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.520]   It is always a joy for us to gather together for worship.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.880]   Praise God for His great love.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.340]   Praise God for His abundant grace over us.
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.980]   And before we begin,
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.360]   I'd like to read for us from Psalm 24, verses one through six.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.320]   The earth is the Lord's and all it contains,
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.980]   the world and those who dwell in it.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.060]   For He has founded it upon the seas
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.680]   and established it upon the rivers.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.640]   Who may ascend into the hill of the Lord
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.640]   and who may stand in His holy place?
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.560]   He who has clean hands and a pure heart,
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.360]   who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.440]   and has not sworn deceitfully,
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.220]   he shall receive a blessing from the Lord
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.760]   and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.400]   This is the generation of those who seek Him,
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.360]   who seek His face, even Jacob.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.560]   Amen, let's worship our God together.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.140]   (gentle music)

[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:43.100]   - All right, good morning.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.980]   Welcome to Bering Community Church.
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.800]   Let me get the announcement started.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.220]   First of all, the college study hall
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.620]   is taking place starting next Sunday at six to 2 a.m.,
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.760]   Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.580]   And so they're taking signups to bring snacks and stuff
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.900]   to encourage our college students.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.940]   So if you can go to the website and sign up,
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.380]   or you can just kind of bring it to the cafe
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.820]   and they'll direct you to where to put that.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.660]   And then at New Year's Eve,
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.380]   we have a ping pong tournament that's going on at 3 p.m.
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.020]   So if you wanna participate in that, it's $5
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.860]   and it will be held in most likely in this room.
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.060]   And then at 11 p.m., our New Year's Eve service
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.020]   is gonna be happening.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.620]   And then from 11 to 12, and then afterwards,
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.380]   we're hoping that by at the latest 12.30,
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.020]   we can send you guys off.
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.900]   So please mark that on your calendar.
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.900]   Galatians Bible study.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.620]   For next session of Galatians Bible study
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.740]   is starting on February 7th.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.380]   And so we have a little bit of break.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.020]   We have maybe about seven to eight week break,
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.540]   but we do need you guys to sign up now.
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.780]   There's only a couple more weeks
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.540]   before this session of Bible study ends,
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.540]   but we need to make sure we prepare.
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.180]   We have enough room and small group leaders
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.060]   and home groups to be able to accommodate the people.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.180]   And so please sign up if you haven't done so,
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.380]   please do that as soon as possible.
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.300]   And then Living Well Pregnancy Center, baby bottle drive.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.860]   So if you've taken one of those,
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.380]   they need that returned by next Sunday at the latest.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.420]   So if you have it, please bring that back by next Sunday.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.820]   And then one last thing I wanna remind you of,
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.700]   every year we have a Lottie Moon Christmas mission offering
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.020]   that we take and then to support the missionaries
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.540]   and for the International Mission Board.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.660]   And so just mark that on your calendar
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.980]   and hopefully on that day on the 24th, you can take that.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.980]   You can give it earlier, but you just have to mark
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.780]   and make sure that it's for the Lottie Moon,
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.220]   the annual missions offering.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.980]   So please pray and to give to those funds.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.180]   And again, that's to support our missionaries
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.660]   and also to the other missionaries in the IMB.
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.660]   All right, if we don't have any other announcement,
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.620]   I'm gonna pray for the offering.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.140]   Again, if you brought physical offering,
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.660]   there's a box in the back on the way out.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.140]   All right, let me pray for us.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:00.620]   Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.780]   Thank you for the privilege we have to serve you.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.300]   We pray that your grace truly would be sufficient.
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.660]   Help us, Lord God, to give you genuine worship
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.860]   in spirit and in truth.
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.260]   May our worship be a pleasing aroma to you.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.500]   May it calibrate our hearts and our minds,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.660]   especially in this busy season,
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.780]   that we would honor you and be purposeful in all that we do.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.820]   I pray, Father God, that you would multiply
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.660]   the offering that we give, 30, 60, 100 fold
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.180]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.020]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.680]   - If you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.440]   to First Corinthians, chapter 11.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:02.160]   We're gonna be taking a break from the Luke's Gospel
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.640]   for just for today, so that we can focus our attention
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.720]   on the communion.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.720]   Wanna make sure that what we're doing in the communion
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.240]   doesn't become a religious activity,
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.480]   and there's always a danger.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.480]   And when we do some things in repetition,
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.480]   that you don't really put much thought into it,
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.200]   and the purpose of it just becomes a religious activity.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.400]   And we do that with everything,
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.480]   whether we come to church,
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.360]   or whether we're singing or giving,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.080]   that it just becomes a habit that we participate in.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.240]   So if you go to church, this is what happens.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.680]   But we need to make sure that this sacred thing
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.000]   that we're doing repeatedly throughout the year,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.960]   that it has the effect that God intended it for us.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.320]   And so let me read the passage
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.480]   in First Corinthians, chapter 11, verse 23 to 34.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.960]   For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.680]   to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.740]   in which he was betrayed took bread.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.320]   When he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.840]   "This is my body, which is for you.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.280]   "Do this in remembrance of me."
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.520]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.360]   saying, "This cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.760]   "Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.140]   "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.740]   "you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.120]   "Therefore, whoever eats the bread
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.560]   "or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.680]   "shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.300]   "But a man must examine himself,
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.560]   "and in so doing, he is to eat of the bread
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.920]   "and drink of the cup.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.480]   "For he who eats and drinks eats and drinks judgment
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.100]   "to himself if he does not judge the body rightly.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.440]   "For this reason, many among you are weak and sick
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.080]   "and a number sleep.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.400]   "But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.520]   "But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.800]   "so that we will not be condemned along with the world.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.320]   "So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat,
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.960]   "wait for one another.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.140]   "If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.880]   "so that you will not come together for judgment.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.040]   "The remaining matters I will arrange when I come."
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:02.880]   Let's pray.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:07.120]   Father, we pray for your blessing.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.020]   We pray for your guidance.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.920]   We pray for deeper understanding, Lord God,
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.400]   that everything that we do,
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.160]   that we would do it as an act of worship
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.960]   in spirit and in truth.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.400]   Lord, we ask for your help as we discern,
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.880]   understand, and practice the things that you've given us.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.540]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.240]   Now, we're in a season of the year
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.780]   where probably most of you guys are busier than normal.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:33.620]   You're wrapping up the year.
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.080]   Some of you guys, you know, if it was in the business world
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.320]   or maybe you're working as engineers,
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.880]   there's projects that needs to get done
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.280]   by the end of the year.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.680]   And so you have deadlines that you need to meet.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.360]   You have families, and so you get together
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.360]   and you have family gatherings.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.960]   If you haven't done your Christmas shopping yet,
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.240]   you're busy making a list and you gotta go and shop
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.560]   and get all the stuff.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:00.560]   In the midst of all of that, you're laboring in the church.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:05.420]   And so some of you guys have volunteered for so many things
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.600]   that your schedule is so packed.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.160]   You know, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.840]   Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.840]   And so in the midst of all of this,
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.160]   there's always a danger of getting burned out.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.900]   And that typically happens around this time of the year
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.480]   where you get so fatigued,
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.680]   and then you're kind of waiting
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.420]   for the end of the year to come.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.340]   And then when January comes, you say, you know what?
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.920]   I'm just gonna take a break.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.200]   And then I'm just gonna, you know,
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.600]   like pull aside and rest up.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:36.320]   We need to be careful that, you know,
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.800]   when that does happen, oftentimes when we take a break
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.600]   because we're fatigued and tired,
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.400]   we automatically think that it may be because we're busy.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.560]   Busyness sometimes just reveals what's happening with us.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.800]   But the idea of burnout basically is
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.920]   when you don't have anything to burn, right?
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.920]   So like in a campfire, when a campfire dies,
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.720]   it's because there's no more wood to burn.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.360]   So oftentimes we automatically think that we're burning up
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.920]   because we're doing too much.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.080]   If you are doing things that feed you,
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.560]   encourage you, challenge you, you can do a lot more, right?
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.560]   Like, and I oftentimes think about when we go to India,
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.160]   I mean, it's one of the probably most tiring weeks
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.760]   out of the whole year, you know?
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.120]   Just the ride itself to get there is like 35,
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.800]   sometimes 40 hours.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.200]   And then as soon as we get off, we grab dinner,
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.180]   and then we fall asleep.
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.500]   We wake up early in the morning,
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.080]   and then we're out there working in the villages,
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.520]   you know, sometimes in the heat and the sun,
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.080]   come back exhausted, and then we crash at night,
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.680]   wake up in the morning, and we do that four or five days.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.960]   And then after we're done,
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.960]   we get head straight to the airport.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.240]   We get maybe a few hours break in between
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.000]   and catch a plane back, 35, you know, sometimes 40 hours,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.180]   and then we get back home, come to church,
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.720]   and then they gotta go to work Monday, you know?
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.760]   But for whatever the reason, every year,
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.620]   we don't have a problem recruiting people to come.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.460]   Like, why would they do that?
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.360]   Spending their own money, taking vacation, you know,
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.080]   to go and just labor and to be fatigued and tired.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.720]   I guess most people that come in are repeatedly come
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.620]   because the fellowship that we experience,
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.900]   the sense of purpose, we feel fed and refreshed.
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.360]   Even though I'm physically tired,
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.960]   I come back always refreshed.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.000]   You know, people ask me, like, when do you take breaks?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.880]   And I kinda consider that my break, you know what I mean?
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.620]   Because our team does such a good job,
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.440]   I don't really need to work too hard
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.200]   other than getting plane tickets and that kind of stuff.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.040]   But I actually get to enjoy the fellowship,
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.120]   enjoy the time that we're there,
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.880]   even though we're physically tired.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.820]   Oftentimes, when we, there's a desire to just step away,
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.040]   and instead of getting restored,
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.560]   you go from burnout to being rusted out, right?
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.960]   'Cause you go from too much to not enough,
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.680]   and then very rarely does somebody burn out
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.360]   and step away and come back refreshed.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.120]   Usually you come back because you feel guilty.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.840]   Like, oh yeah, you know, I can't do this anymore,
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.880]   you stayed away for so long,
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.240]   and everybody's huffing and puffing,
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.080]   and it's like, hey, maybe, you know,
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.360]   you took a break, should you come back?
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.800]   And you don't feel any more refreshed
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.000]   than when you first took a break,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.280]   but by the time you come back,
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.120]   you're kind of like, okay, you know, I gotta get back.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.640]   And then you repeat the cycle over and over again.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:20.160]   Burnout simply means that what was fueling
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.400]   the energy that you needed is exhausted, it's not there.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.840]   You're burning more than that's intake.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.840]   So your intake is much less than what is going out.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.000]   That's what that means.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.240]   The reason why I say all of this
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.320]   is because the communion table
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.080]   was meant for the refreshment of the church.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.480]   That God knew that our natural tendency
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.280]   is to run with our own energy.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.000]   And he wanted to make sure that through the communion table,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.280]   what he intended for that
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.520]   would cause us to be strengthened and refreshed.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.760]   So everything that God calls us to do
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.440]   was really meant to be refreshed by the communion table.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.440]   So again, if we participate
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.560]   without really understanding what it is, it's just bread.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.160]   In fact, it takes an additional 10 minutes
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.660]   of our Sunday morning to do this ceremony
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.480]   that really has no effect on anybody
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.920]   other than it's just a religious thing.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.060]   No, I did something God told me to do.
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.800]   So I wanna make sure that as we participate in it,
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.200]   and periodically I do this
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.960]   just so that we don't just participate
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.880]   in a simply religious manner.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.620]   First and foremost, communion is a replacement
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.040]   of the Passover meal.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.880]   Now, you guys remember when it was inaugurated
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.600]   as Jesus was preparing his disciples
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.280]   to go to the cross next day,
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.740]   he participated in this Passover meal
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:41.640]   that God inaugurated with Israel for 1,200 years.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.880]   For 1,200 years, it was to commemorate,
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.880]   to remember the exodus coming from Egypt,
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:54.240]   that how God delivered them, how they began a new nation,
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.560]   how God gave the law,
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.960]   how God sustained them through the desert.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.600]   So for 1,200 years so that they would not forget their God,
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.480]   and Jesus says, "Do this in remembrance of me."
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.600]   I want you to understand
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.740]   just how important this statement is.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.160]   Luke 22, 15, it says, "And he said to them,
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.560]   "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover meal with you
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.840]   "before I suffer."
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.200]   And then verse 19,
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.000]   "When he had taken some bread and given thanks,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   "he broke it and gave it to them, saying,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   "This is my body which is given to you.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.240]   "Do this in remembrance of me."
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.160]   Now, when we just read that,
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.520]   he's like, "Oh, he's doing Passover,
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.120]   "so now whenever we have communion,
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.400]   "that we are supposed to do this in remembrance of it."
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.120]   If they were understanding correctly,
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.500]   they would have understood that Jesus basically was saying
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.500]   that for 1,200 years, this Passover meal was given to them
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.160]   so that they would not forget God, Yahweh,
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.920]   who delivered them.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.160]   For 1,200 years, every single year,
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.640]   they went through the drama
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.160]   so that they would recognize who God is.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.120]   And now Jesus is saying, "Do that,
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.840]   "and do this in remembrance of me."
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.620]   In other words, I'm going to be replacing
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.760]   what you've been doing for God.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.260]   Now you're gonna do it for me.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:18.080]   If Jesus was not God, and he said this,
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.480]   and the disciples were paying attention,
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.360]   it would have been cause for them to pick up stone
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.620]   and stone him immediately.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.680]   Because if there was any doubt in anybody
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.480]   studying the New Testament
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.600]   that Jesus is claiming to be God Almighty,
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.700]   this would have sealed the deal for sure.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.480]   How can somebody who is just a man,
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.560]   how can somebody who is just a Messiah, just a king,
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.080]   say this Passover meal for 1,200 years,
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.540]   what you've been doing to remember God,
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.760]   now do this in remembrance of me.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.320]   Jesus was clearly saying he is God.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.420]   And in verse 20, "And in the same way,
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.280]   "he took the cup after they had eaten it,
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.460]   "saying, 'This cup which is poured out for you
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.400]   "'is the new covenant in my blood.'"
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.840]   Can a man implement a covenant by himself
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.520]   with a nation of Israel?
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:14.120]   No, this is something that only God could do.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.960]   A unilateral covenant was that
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.440]   I'm gonna make this covenant with you,
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.600]   only God could do that.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.800]   So Jesus says not only do this in remembrance of me,
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.240]   and I'm gonna inaugurate a new covenant
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.860]   that I'm gonna shed my blood.
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:30.520]   If the disciples did not believe that he was God,
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:35.240]   they were obligated to stone him right there,
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.400]   'cause he made it absolutely crystal clear.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:43.480]   The Passover meal was replaced 2,000 years ago.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:48.480]   All the drama of all the Passover meals,
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.320]   all the meals, all the festivals that God inaugurated
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.560]   to the nation of Israel, and this, above all,
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.880]   he said, was for him.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.720]   It was for him, all of redemptive.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.000]   It wasn't like God was doing one thing with one group,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.440]   and then all of a sudden,
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.680]   there's another thing that's happening.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.200]   He said, no, all of it was being fulfilled in Christ.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.160]   This morning, I don't wanna focus my attention
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.320]   on what exactly we're doing.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.800]   We can sit here and talk about what does it mean?
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.120]   Is it transubstantiation?
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.480]   Is it consubstantiation?
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.080]   Is it dynamic presence of Christ?
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.640]   But I don't wanna spend this morning
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.160]   talking about just the theological aspect of what this is.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.320]   We're a Baptist church.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.160]   We believe that this is symbolic so that we can remember,
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.880]   and the reason why we believe that
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.520]   is because that's exactly how the Passover was practiced.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.920]   Passover, in and of itself, did not have any kind of power
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.960]   over the nation of Israel.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.080]   It was given to them so that they can remember
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.520]   and not forget.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.360]   If this is a replacement of what they were doing
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.840]   at Passover, then the meaning behind the Passover
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.880]   is added to the communion table,
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.000]   which was for the purpose of remembering.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.640]   What is it that they're supposed to remember?
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.000]   What is it that they're supposed to remember
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.360]   and then the consequence of not remembering?
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.800]   So there's three things that I wanna highlight here
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.000]   of what this is supposed to do.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   One, the Passover meal is to remember
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.480]   God's deliverance of Israel.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.880]   It was their day of freedom.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.600]   July 4th is America's Independence Day.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.080]   In fact, in almost every country,
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.680]   they have a day that they celebrate
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.200]   where they, significant enough,
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.960]   whether they were delivered from oppression
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.160]   or there was a beginning of the nation
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.360]   or a specific dynasty, there's a particular date
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.560]   that almost every nation will celebrate
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.600]   as their independence, as the inauguration
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.760]   of their country.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.520]   Well, this was their Independence Day,
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.400]   but this was unique to them
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.120]   because this Independence Day was not
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.360]   because of their courage.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.560]   It wasn't because of their great leaders.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.680]   It was that every Independence Day,
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.080]   their Independence Day in the Passover meal
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.880]   would cause them to remember it was God.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.560]   In Exodus 13, three, it says,
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.240]   "Moses said to the people, 'Remember this day
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.760]   "'in which you went out from Egypt,
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.920]   "'from the house of slavery,
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.040]   "'for by a powerful hand of the Lord
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.760]   "'brought you out from this place,
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.080]   "'and nothing leavened shall be eaten.'"
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.440]   Every year, they would go through this drama
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.160]   of how God would deliver them,
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.280]   how they had to leave in haste,
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.360]   the things that they ate, the bitter herbs,
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.240]   all of it that we do.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.680]   Every Easter, we go through the drama
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.360]   of the Passover meal because in every aspect
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.160]   of this Passover meal, there was a clear pointing
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.000]   to Christ, that Christ was going to fulfill this.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.960]   And all of this pointed to the fact
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.960]   that the moment that they forgot who they are
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.880]   and who God is in their life, what was gonna happen?
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.280]   Everything that they do was going to be meaningless.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.840]   The sacrifice that they give, the obeying of the law,
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:59.520]   all of it was an avenue to bring them to him.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.280]   So that's why you remember when you get
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.880]   to the latter part of Israel's history,
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.640]   when you get to the prophets, God rebukes them
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.520]   for their many sacrifices.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.320]   God rebukes them for saying that the singing
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.080]   is noise to them.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.400]   He calls their assembly an evil assembly.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.840]   The reason why is because they forgot God.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.120]   They were going through the rituals,
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.800]   making many sacrifices, but they forgot
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.520]   why they were doing that.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.000]   What was the reason behind that?
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.520]   Instead of an act of worship, it was their way
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.200]   of earning righteousness in the kingdom.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.360]   And that's why God said this is detestable
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.520]   because the whole purpose of the Passover meal,
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.960]   whole purpose of all these festivities
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.400]   is to remind them that God delivered you,
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.560]   that you were saved.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.400]   Every single one of us, when we talk about burnout
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.640]   is when you are engaging in activity
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.080]   that you're not even sure, after a while,
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.520]   you're not even sure why you're doing it.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.720]   Maybe you were pressured to do it.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.040]   Maybe you feel obligated.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.960]   Maybe your friends are doing it so you signed up
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.080]   'cause they're doing it so you're supposed to do it.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.560]   And so whether it's expectation,
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.400]   whether it's just maybe you're just,
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.680]   you were just good all the time.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.360]   And you're just kind of applying that to your life
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.480]   and then after a while, you're not exactly sure
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.320]   why you're doing it.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.360]   So if you engage in something that you enjoy doing,
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.020]   it feeds you, encourages you.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.760]   But if you engage in something that you're not
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.160]   exactly sure why you're doing it,
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.520]   even a little bit of it fatigues you, it tires you.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.000]   I'll give you an example.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.280]   If you're meeting up with somebody
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.440]   that you just love and adore,
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.600]   you put that on your calendar and you're waiting,
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.360]   so you're gonna go there and I wanna share this
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.760]   and you can sit there with that person
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.520]   and two, three, four, five hours go by
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.120]   and the only reason why you even separate
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.020]   is because you have other obligations.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:52.600]   And then you meet somebody where you're burdened.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.980]   I mean, you have to meet them.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:58.920]   For whatever the reason and you're already dreading it.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.840]   It's Monday and Thursday's coming around.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.000]   It's like, oh my gosh.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.960]   And you get fatigued and tired.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.520]   And then as soon as you get there,
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.640]   you gotta say what you gotta say
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.760]   and you're looking at your watch
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.120]   and looking for reasons to get out of there.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.280]   Even a little bit of time spent with somebody
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.920]   that you don't wanna be with versus a lot of time
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   with somebody that you really want to be with,
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.040]   you know how that feels.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.000]   It's night and day.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.280]   Our natural tendency is when we forget
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.560]   why we are doing what we are doing,
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.680]   everything that we do in the church becomes a burden.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.220]   Eventually.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.880]   What started out as an act of worship
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.040]   eventually becomes an obligation
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.800]   and then the obligation becomes a burden
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.240]   and then that's where the burnout comes in.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.980]   Burnout doesn't simply come because you're doing too much.
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:47.360]   Now, there's always a danger of that.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.040]   You have to know your balance.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:54.600]   But usually burnout comes because you're not exactly sure
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.840]   why you're doing what you're doing.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.720]   So that's why he told the nation of Israel,
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.760]   do not forget who I am.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.140]   Do not forget what you have.
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.440]   First Corinthians 11, 26,
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.960]   for as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.440]   you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.600]   It's to remind us that we've been saved
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.120]   by the blood of Christ.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:19.280]   If grace is no longer amazing to you,
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.380]   it's just grace.
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:24.680]   Remember, Dr. Michael Horton wrote a book
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.520]   called Putting Amazing Back Into Grace
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.120]   and that's probably one of the best books I've read
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.480]   in probably the last 15 years.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.200]   Putting Amazing Back Into Grace.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.280]   When grace is no longer amazing,
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.920]   it affects everything that we do.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.920]   It affects our worship, it affects our discipleship,
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.440]   it affects our evangelism, it affects our prayer life,
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.800]   it affects our Bible study,
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:49.640]   where we are no longer awed by Christ and what he has done.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.640]   That's why the communion table was given to us
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.640]   to remind us every time we participate in this communion,
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.960]   you don't come here by your own merit.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.840]   It's a reminder to us every time we do this
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.920]   that we're saved by grace.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.800]   Son of God died for me.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:10.840]   Now I know, I know that this is fundamental,
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.560]   this is basic, but you've heard it so many times
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.620]   that it does nothing.
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:21.240]   You've heard it so many times, it's just part of theology,
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.860]   that's part of the gospel, but put yourself back
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:26.960]   to when you first heard the gospel,
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:31.400]   that somebody died so that you can live.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.940]   I mean, let that sink in.
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.520]   Somebody died so that you can live.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:41.520]   Now imagine the person that died was God.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:47.320]   He died for you, not because you were a diamond in the rough.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:51.800]   He said, while we were yet sinners, while we were hostile,
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.300]   not because we had potential,
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.040]   but simply because we were desperate
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.680]   and there was no way of life without him.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:03.160]   And this is what we celebrate every single week.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:07.000]   This is what we sing, this is what we memorize,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.500]   and this is what we're supposed to preach,
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.440]   and yet, if we're not careful,
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.400]   we become so inoculated by this truth,
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.120]   it does nothing other than,
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.080]   oh, okay, he's saying the right things.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.640]   But how does that affect you?
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.240]   Do you remember when you first met Christ?
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.920]   Some of you may remember very vividly,
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.680]   and some of you, maybe it was like a transition,
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.160]   you can't pinpoint exactly where it is,
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:38.040]   but every single one of us, we encountered the living God,
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:41.000]   and this encounter changed our lives.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.120]   So let me ask you, what was it that you were freed from?
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:49.240]   What were you afraid of, just loneliness?
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.680]   You lacked purpose, and now you have purpose?
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.700]   You're afraid that if you died,
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.800]   you don't know where you're gonna go,
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.560]   so you met Christ, and then now you know
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.200]   where you're gonna go, is that what happened?
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.880]   Or maybe you heard some theological truth,
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.240]   and you say, you know, that sounds about right,
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.800]   and you just kind of gave mental assent,
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.060]   is that how you became a Christian?
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.680]   No, you didn't become a Christian
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.640]   because you found a set of facts
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.120]   to be more logical than these set of facts,
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.600]   and you say, okay, I'm not gonna give that.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.240]   No, that's not how you get saved.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.040]   We got saved because we encountered this living God,
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.640]   and as a result of encountering this God, this holy God,
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.040]   we recognize our helplessness, our sinful state,
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.060]   which is what caused us to repent.
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:39.320]   If you don't recognize your sinfulness,
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.040]   and all it was just an assent,
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.160]   or you know, like, believing God makes more sense
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.320]   than not believing God, so I stand here
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.620]   instead of over there, that's not what happened.
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:56.140]   People who are utterly helpless, dead in our trespasses,
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.500]   under the reign of sin and death,
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:03.280]   while we were yet sinners, Christ came and died for our sins.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:10.540]   If that doesn't move you, that doesn't cause you to change,
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.600]   then something has happened, we've drifted.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.940]   I don't care if you're doing the right thing,
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.900]   I don't care how hard you're serving,
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.100]   I don't care what you've done in the past,
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:24.220]   if the truth of the gospel no longer moves you
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.040]   in any way, you've drifted.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.480]   You've already drifted.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.940]   Maybe your foot hasn't drifted,
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:35.700]   maybe your thoughts haven't drifted, but you've drifted.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.620]   Because what God wants more than anything else
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.260]   is for us to worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:44.580]   To worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.300]   And so the communion table was given to us
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.060]   to make sure that as you're serving,
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.740]   as you're doing parking duty, as you're serving the children,
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.700]   as you're sacrificing, that you're doing it
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.020]   as an act of worship.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:01.220]   But the moment we forget who we are and what Christ has done
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:05.420]   it just becomes activity, religious activity.
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.140]   Hebrews 2.1, for this reason we must pay much closer
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.680]   attention to what we have heard so that we do not drift away.
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.220]   So that we do not drift away.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:20.060]   As a pastor, when I forget what caused me
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.140]   to want to preach the gospel, it just becomes a job.
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:27.740]   And so as a job, I can just do my duty,
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.820]   give the messages, go home,
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:35.660]   and then just take care of my bills, do visitations.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:37.440]   I could, it's just a job.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.900]   And some people do a good job, some people do a bad job,
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:41.980]   but it's just a job.
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:47.720]   When it becomes a job, I can no longer lead this church.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.940]   'Cause my, I have not been, I was not called
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.260]   to manage this church.
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:55.420]   I have not called so that we can have a larger building
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:58.740]   and everybody feels welcomed and the church is growing
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:01.220]   and our music sounds great and our budget is good.
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.380]   That's not what I was called to do.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.580]   I was called to represent Christ.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:09.660]   So when a pastor forgets why he's here,
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.420]   I have to constantly remind myself,
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:12.700]   why are you doing what you're doing?
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.020]   Why are you doing that?
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.220]   Why are you doing that?
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:20.220]   If a church forgets why they're doing what they're doing,
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:24.380]   it just becomes a place of gathering, to belong somewhere.
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.940]   And just like any other belonging,
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.500]   there's rules and things that you have to do to belong.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.740]   You have to be a member, you have to come to Bible study,
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.860]   you have to serve, you have to give.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:36.460]   But it's just a place of belonging when a church forgets.
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:40.480]   When the congregation, Christians, forget,
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.780]   it just becomes labor.
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.700]   Just worship.
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.980]   You're not worshiping, just labor.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.700]   What do I have to do?
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.900]   Oh, if I'm a college student, what am I supposed to do?
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.820]   I have to go to Friday?
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.020]   Do I have to go to searchlight?
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.020]   Do I have to do this?
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:00.380]   If you're a BAM, is that retreat, is that mandatory?
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:01.220]   Oh, is that mandatory?
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.300]   Like, oh, you go to Bible study?
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.700]   I have to do that?
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:04.820]   I have to serve?
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:09.980]   And so when you are shamed or obligated to do something,
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:13.020]   eventually, it's gonna break.
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.260]   And that's where the burnout comes from
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.900]   because you're exercising and there's nothing being fed.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:23.020]   So first and foremost is to remind us
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.260]   of why we're doing what we're doing.
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.220]   So hopefully, when we open up the communion table,
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.540]   we'll give you some time to reflect and think.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:32.700]   Like, when you hear that God loves you
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.300]   and he sent his only begotten son to die for you,
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.700]   when was the last time that actually moved you?
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.980]   Caused you to worship and to change
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:43.300]   and want to be near him?
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:46.940]   Secondly, the Passover served to remind Israel
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:50.860]   of God's care and deliverance during a period of hardship.
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:53.140]   Deuteronomy 7, 17 to 19, it says,
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.820]   "If you should say in your heart,
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.500]   "these nations are greater than I,
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.700]   "how can I dispossess them?
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.220]   "Then you shall not be afraid of them.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:03.180]   "You shall well remember what the Lord your God did
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.500]   "to Pharaoh and to all of Egypt.
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.700]   "The great trials which your eyes have seen
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.740]   "and the great trials which your eyes saw
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.740]   "and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.460]   "and the outstretched arm by which the Lord your God
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.740]   "brought you out, so shall the Lord your God
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.740]   "do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid."
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.660]   You know, this year, I think we've attended more funerals
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.580]   than all the other years, you know?
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:31.460]   I know that in this room, many of you have gone through
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.460]   heart-wrenching hardship in life.
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.900]   Whether it was a death in the family
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:39.260]   that you cared for, or maybe it was a job situation,
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:40.340]   maybe it's a family situation,
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:42.020]   maybe it was with your children,
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:43.780]   maybe it was a health issue,
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.980]   but whatever circumstances are
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:48.220]   that you went through some hardship.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.260]   And in the context of hardship,
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.700]   there's always a danger to focus our attention
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.660]   on the hardship and not to focus on God.
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:00.940]   And God knew that nation of Israel, as they became free,
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:02.780]   that as they are walking in the desert,
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.460]   that they're gonna have greater hardship,
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:08.260]   different kind of hardship, than when they were in Egypt.
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:11.100]   So remember, Israel, the moment they forgot,
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:13.220]   remember what they said?
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:16.300]   The moment they forgot of who God is and what God has done,
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.140]   remember what they did?
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.220]   Every time hardship came, they said,
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.780]   "It was much easier when we were in Egypt.
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.500]   "At least over there we had food.
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:26.060]   "At least over there we had water."
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.340]   Because they forgot.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:32.580]   And the moment that we forget, and we get squeezed,
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.540]   the first thing we begin to think is like,
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.420]   oh, okay, if we just tweak things,
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.940]   if we did this and we did that.
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.900]   In Isaiah 51, 12 to 13, it says,
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:43.340]   "I, even I, am he who comforts you.
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:47.140]   "Who are you that you are afraid of man who dies?
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:49.780]   "And the son of man who is made like grass,
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.520]   "that you have forgotten the Lord your maker,
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.660]   "who stretched out heavens
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.400]   "and laid the foundations of the earth,
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.680]   "that you fear continually all day long
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.380]   "because of the fury of the oppressor?"
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:04.340]   When hardship comes, your faith always gets tested.
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:07.060]   Your faith gets tested.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:08.180]   Do you believe God?
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:11.660]   What kind of God do you believe?
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:15.820]   Do you believe that God just kind of made you
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.500]   and wound up the clock and just kind of let you go
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.780]   and for you to figure it out?
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.620]   Or do you believe in a sovereign God?
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:26.160]   That who is absolutely in control of all things?
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:30.380]   And when hardship comes, in time of peace,
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:32.220]   you're not forced to deal with that,
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:35.000]   but when hardship and difficulty and trials come,
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.100]   it tests you.
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:37.100]   Do you believe?
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:42.860]   When trials come, our natural tendency is to think,
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:43.820]   what do I need to do?
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:44.660]   What can I do?
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:48.180]   And then when we get overwhelmed, we say, oh my gosh.
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:50.640]   Maybe if we did this, maybe if we did that.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.460]   But the Passover meal was to remind them
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.620]   that he who delivered you will sustain you.
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.660]   He didn't go through all that drama of delivering you
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.540]   to free you, to bring you out into the desert
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:05.540]   so that you would starve to death.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:11.940]   Remember, even as Satan was asking to sift Peter
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:15.300]   and the disciples like wheat, remember what Jesus said?
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:16.700]   He asked permission.
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.420]   He had to come to God and ask permission.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.780]   Satan, isn't like someday like Satan wins
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.340]   and someday God wins?
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:24.820]   And then when hardship comes, you think like,
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:25.900]   oh, Satan's winning.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.100]   Why is God not delivering me?
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:32.540]   Said even in the most harshest, difficult trials,
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:35.380]   there's nothing that you will experience
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:37.800]   that is outside of God's sovereign hands.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:40.700]   And sometimes you don't even know what you're thinking
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:44.160]   until the trials come into your life and it gets revealed.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.880]   And anxiety and depression and all this stuff
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.820]   start to creep in because we fix so much of our attention
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.540]   on what we can't control.
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:55.580]   But those circumstances are given to us to remind us
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:56.900]   that God is in control.
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:01.620]   So the Passover meal was given to them to remind them
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:05.260]   that you worship and you serve and you follow
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.780]   a sovereign God who is all-powerful,
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.940]   creator of the universe, who loves you
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.500]   and gave his son to die for you.
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:15.620]   In Romans 8, 31 to 35, what then shall we say
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:16.460]   to these things?
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:19.420]   If God is for us, who is against us?
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:20.620]   Let me stop right there.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:25.060]   And the question really is, do you believe that?
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:31.060]   If God is for you, what can be against you?
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:34.860]   Is there something bigger than God?
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:38.100]   Is there something that can happen in your life
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.340]   that God wouldn't have any control over?
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:45.220]   Is there anything that can happen in your life,
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:48.060]   to your children's life, to your parents' life?
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:51.940]   Is there anything that can happen in life
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:55.180]   where God has no control?
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.820]   Obviously, it's a rhetorical question.
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.740]   The answer is no, of course not.
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.980]   But sometimes we forget that.
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.900]   And because we forget that, he told them
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.060]   to celebrate the Passover meal,
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:14.940]   to remember in times of trials, God is still in control.
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.700]   He who did not spare his own son,
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:19.660]   how will he not, along with him, give us all things?
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:23.340]   It is completely illogical that he was willing
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:25.780]   to give his only begotten son,
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:28.820]   but he's unwilling to give you health.
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:33.500]   He was willing to have his son absorb all our sins,
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:37.780]   but he has nothing to do with your trials.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:39.700]   It makes absolutely no sense.
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:41.700]   It's completely illogical.
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.140]   And yet, we keep falling into that, over and over.
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:46.300]   Every time trials come, every time difficult time comes.
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.940]   So where is God?
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:49.260]   Why is God not doing this?
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.540]   That even in the harshest, most difficult situation,
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:56.300]   the Passover meal was to remind them
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.140]   that God who delivered you out of Egypt
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.340]   is the one who will continue to sustain you.
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:03.660]   So when we come to the communion table,
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:06.940]   to be reminded that these elements were given to you,
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:09.740]   it was an expression of his love and his care for us.
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:14.100]   Third and finally, the Passover served to remind us
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:18.900]   that God's provision during the time of abundance.
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:22.380]   Some of us are sitting in here
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:23.820]   and you don't have much trials.
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.860]   You suffer through other people's suffering,
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.460]   but right now, your bills are paid,
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:31.700]   your children are healthy, you have a decent house.
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:37.980]   There's nothing really bad happening in your life.
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:39.700]   Maybe you made some good investments
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:42.940]   and you have your house prices going up,
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:45.460]   or maybe you worked hard and you have a big bonus
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:47.060]   coming at the end of the year.
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.700]   And so as a result of that, you become complacent,
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:56.020]   where God has become a want and not a need.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:01.220]   And then you made the material things of this world
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:02.980]   that is a want, a need.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:07.580]   You make a bucket list and you gotta go down the list
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.260]   like I need this, I need this, I need this.
[00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:10.780]   And so when something becomes a need,
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:13.100]   it becomes your priority, right?
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.180]   You put it on your bucket list
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.420]   and all of a sudden it becomes a need.
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.100]   I need to save this money.
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.740]   I need to buy this car.
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:21.020]   I need to do this, I need to do that.
[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:22.260]   And so that becomes our priority.
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:26.660]   But when it comes to God, we made a need into a want.
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:28.260]   I want to be better.
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:30.700]   I want to read, I want to pray.
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:34.460]   But that's the danger of being rich,
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:38.180]   that we don't recognize how desperate we are.
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:44.140]   We don't recognize how urgent it is for us to be with God.
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.220]   We have forgotten because of our wealth.
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.140]   And that's why the communion table,
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:52.060]   the Passover meal was given to us,
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.580]   that in the time of abundance
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.380]   that we would not become arrogant.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:58.780]   It's like, you know, it's nice if we have it,
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:02.020]   but if we don't have it, there's no huge consequence.
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:03.660]   In verse 11 through 14, it said,
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.580]   "Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.540]   "by not keeping his commandments and his ordinances
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.700]   "and his statutes which I am commanding you today.
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.420]   "Otherwise, when you have eaten and are satisfied."
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.420]   When you have eaten and are satisfied,
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:17.620]   when things are good,
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:20.860]   and have built good houses and lived in them,
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:23.100]   and when your herds and your flocks multiply
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.500]   and your silver and gold multiply,
[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:26.380]   and all that you have multiplies,
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.900]   'cause you made some good decisions.
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.380]   You've invested in cryptocurrency
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:36.100]   and you became a multimillionaire.
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:40.820]   And so your belly is full, and then your heart become proud,
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:42.540]   and you will forget the Lord your God
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:44.380]   who brought you out from the land of Egypt,
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.580]   out of the house of slavery.
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:50.660]   You know, the most dangerous place for a Christian to be
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:55.580]   is to find success while you're not doing well with Christ.
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:57:00.680]   That's the most dangerous place that any Christian can be.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:05.820]   Your children are doing well, your bills are paid,
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:09.180]   you're healthy, your future looks bright,
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.660]   but you're not right with God.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:13.900]   You haven't prayed in a while.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:16.780]   You're not hungry for his word.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.020]   There's no desperation in your heart.
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:20.900]   And yet your life is doing great.
[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:27.420]   And it causes you to be proud and independent.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:29.780]   And you think that you can do this,
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.340]   as long as I can get to heaven.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:36.500]   That's a deception that Satan brings to rich people.
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:40.860]   When we have forgotten the urgency of our heart,
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:44.940]   that I can't breathe, I can't live,
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:49.140]   I can't do anything without Christ.
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.940]   And that's what riches does.
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:55.060]   The deception of riches causes us to think
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:56.900]   that I can go through this life
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:00.300]   just kind of straggling behind,
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:03.660]   instead of desperate for him.
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:05.340]   He says, "Otherwise, you may say in your heart,
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:08.740]   "my power and strength of my hand made me his wealth,
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:11.020]   "this wealth, but you shall remember
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:12.380]   "the Lord your God, for it is he
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:15.100]   "who is giving you power to make wealth,
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.900]   "that he may confirm his covenant,
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.980]   "which he swore to your fathers, as it is this day."
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.460]   Psalm 90, verse 12, it says,
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.060]   "Teach us to number our days,
[00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:27.460]   "that we may present to you a heart of wisdom."
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:29.900]   I want you to listen to this verse.
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:32.300]   Basically, he's saying,
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:35.580]   "Lord, remind me that I'm gonna die."
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:36.420]   Right?
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:38.100]   That's the Peter Kim translation.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:39.900]   That's basically what he's saying.
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:41.180]   "Lord, teach me to number my days."
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:42.860]   That's a fancy way of saying,
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:46.180]   "Remind me that I'm gonna die."
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:47.020]   Right?
[00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:49.780]   "Whether I'm 50 or 70 or 100,
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:52.700]   "Lord, please remind me I'm gonna die."
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:54.060]   That's a morbid thing to say,
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:57.420]   especially in a culture that celebrates life and youth.
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:58.240]   Right?
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.300]   He said, "No, in fact, this is so important."
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:04.940]   He says, "That I may present to you a heart of wisdom."
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:09.220]   So the requirement for a heart of wisdom
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.860]   is a recognition that we're gonna die,
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:13.980]   that we are here temporarily,
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:15.940]   that we're just passing through,
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:17.820]   that even the wildest success
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.740]   that you may have experienced in life,
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:22.100]   you may have made the best decisions,
[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.200]   and you have a big, fat bonus coming,
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.420]   that in the midst of all of that,
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.840]   if you really want wisdom, he says,
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.180]   "Remember, this is all temporary,
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.980]   "that I'm gonna die."
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:36.140]   Whether you're 20, whether you're 50,
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.520]   whether you're healthy or unhealthy,
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:41.060]   whether you have good genes or bad genes,
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:42.020]   we're all gonna die.
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:45.520]   Why is this so important?
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.380]   Because in eternity,
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:51.460]   the life that you and I lived on this earth is a blip,
[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:54.620]   it is a mist that comes and disappears.
[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:57.300]   Now, those of you in your 20s, that's a theory.
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:59.180]   Right?
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:00.020]   That's a theory,
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.260]   because you have most of your life ahead of you,
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.420]   Lord willing, right?
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.260]   And Lord may not be willing, right?
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:10.600]   But Lord willing, you might get to a bit older.
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:15.120]   Those of you in your 30s, like, "Oh, my back hurts."
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:15.960]   Right?
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.780]   And you act like you're old men,
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:21.100]   but you're not in your 20s anymore, for sure.
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:21.940]   Right?
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.000]   You can't run with a 20-year-old,
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.880]   so you're starting to feel a little bit,
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:25.800]   "Okay, I'm getting older."
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.040]   You're not old yet, but you're getting older.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:33.520]   In your 40s, nobody calls you young man anymore, right?
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.360]   'Cause now you're starting to feel it,
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.720]   and then you go to the doctors,
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:36.760]   and then you say, "I can't see."
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.360]   It's like, "Yeah, that's normal."
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.300]   Right?
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:41.600]   They don't try to fix it.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.200]   And then in 50s, if you're healthy,
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.700]   they're like, "Wow, that's great."
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:47.540]   Right?
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.760]   'Cause they expect you to be, right?
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.740]   And I remember asking my mom
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.300]   what period of her life was the hardest,
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.680]   and she said it was in her 60s,
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.860]   because she has half the responsibility,
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:59.320]   but a quarter of the energy.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.020]   Which is true, right?
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:04.920]   I'm starting to feel it.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.840]   I said, "Teach us to number our days,
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.220]   "because it goes by so quick."
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.240]   And I was just, as I was preparing for this message,
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.080]   I was thinking to myself,
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.780]   like, "You know, my 25th birthday,
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.680]   "it felt like yesterday."
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.480]   It literally felt like yesterday,
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.680]   even though it was only like 15 years ago.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.520]   (audience laughing)
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.020]   Oh, you're paying attention, okay.
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:28.860]   All right.
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.960]   It literally felt like yesterday.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:32.920]   They're thinking like all of it.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.600]   So, you know, as we get older,
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.120]   our mind is still young,
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.080]   but our body says no, right?
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.160]   And those of you guys who play sports,
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.000]   you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.520]   You're dribbling to the left,
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.000]   and in your mind, you pass the guy,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.920]   but your body runs straight into the guy.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.800]   (audience laughing)
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.080]   He said, "The beginning of wisdom
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:57.960]   "is to recognize our finiteness, our weakness.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:00.040]   "Where we become proud
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.780]   "is we think we can live independent of God.
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:07.340]   "We don't realize how fragile we are.
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.800]   "We don't realize that that tiny little bacteria
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.900]   "shut down the whole world that we knew.
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:17.720]   "That tiny bacteria, we didn't even see it.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.560]   "That's how fragile we are."
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:25.840]   And yet, pride, it's so easy to be filled with pride.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.000]   It doesn't take much.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.080]   You make a little bit more money,
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.480]   your eyes a little bit more rounder than other people,
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.280]   right, your hair's a little bit more blacker
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.280]   than somebody else.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.000]   It doesn't take much for us to become proud.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.760]   That's why God inaugurated this.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.420]   He said, "So keep them humble.
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:49.600]   "That remember, remember the height
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.700]   "from which you had fallen.
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.560]   "Repent and do the things you did at first,
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.020]   "because the moment you forget who you are,
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.480]   "the moment you forget who God is
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.760]   "and what he has done for you,
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.160]   "then you get burned out."
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.240]   It just becomes a religious activity.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:09.200]   And you can't handle doing all the things that you're doing.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.320]   Before we open up the communion table,
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.040]   I want to say three things,
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.940]   three different titles that are given.
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.800]   If you were to comb through,
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.720]   there's all kinds of different titles given to this,
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.040]   but these three main things
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.040]   are what you probably are used to hearing.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.000]   One is ordinance, right?
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.120]   This communion table is called one of two ordinances.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.160]   Ordinance basically means a set of rules.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.520]   So if, let's say, if Irvine has an ordinance
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.880]   that people who are under the 18
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.280]   can't be out past 10 o'clock,
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.720]   and there was a period, I forgot why they did that,
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.300]   may have been during the pandemic,
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.760]   that you couldn't be out after 10 o'clock
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.460]   if you're under 18, right?
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:48.640]   Was that true?
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.840]   Am I making this up?
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.320]   Yeah, I remember, but that's what an ordinance is.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.680]   Ordinance is a set of rules, a law,
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:57.320]   that is passed in that region that you have to follow.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.840]   So when we say that these are ordinances, right,
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.400]   these are mandated, this is not an option.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:06.920]   So you cannot be a church and choose,
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.960]   ah, you know this ordinance,
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.080]   and we're not gonna practice it, right?
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:14.140]   Our desire to have three worships,
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:15.840]   the way we worship, we're gonna sing hymns
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.340]   or contemporary songs,
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:18.900]   which version of the Bible we're gonna use,
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.820]   these are not ordinances.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:22.840]   These are just us trying to do our best
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.160]   to apply what we see in scripture.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.960]   But there's two ordinances that are mandated in scripture
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.480]   that every church that claims to be a church must practice.
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:32.680]   And so this is the difference
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.960]   between a parachurch and a church.
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.700]   A parachurch doesn't feel the necessity
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.120]   to practice these ordinances
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.040]   because they say they're not a church.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:45.360]   So the church, if you are a church,
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.840]   these two ordinances are mandated.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:51.360]   Baptism is commanded, is not suggested,
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.360]   it is commanded in scripture.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.400]   And that's why, because it is an ordinance
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.560]   that we examine carefully.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.400]   What does it teach?
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.600]   How are we supposed to practice?
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.600]   What is the meaning behind it?
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.720]   And so we wanna make sure that every part of scripture
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.040]   is applied the way we see it in scripture.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.640]   It's not about how you feel about it,
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.360]   it's not about how tradition and you are brought up.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.520]   At the end of the day,
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.520]   we test everything that we do according to scripture.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.720]   So we practice baptism
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.960]   the way we see the Bible teaching it.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:24.080]   Because it is an ordinance, it's commanded.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.560]   It wasn't suggested.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.560]   He didn't just say, hey, practice baptism,
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.660]   but you can do whatever you want, however you feel.
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:32.720]   No, there's specific meaning, pattern, mode
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.800]   that was given to us, so we try to practice that.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:38.060]   But today, we're not trying to get into baptism.
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:41.520]   But communion is the second one.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.760]   So baptism is the union with Christ.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.080]   It is a marriage ceremony
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.920]   between two people getting married.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.480]   They're making a public confession
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.480]   that we're entering into this covenant relationship
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.660]   with one another.
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:54.040]   That's what a baptism is.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.880]   So that's why we believe that infant baptism
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.880]   isn't the baptism we see in scripture.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:03.240]   Because infant baptism has nothing to do with the infant.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.840]   It was just done to that kid.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.820]   So that's not baptism.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.880]   That's not what we see in scripture.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:12.780]   Baptism is a union between a sinner, repentant,
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.480]   being united to Christ.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.160]   So he must be able to make a public confession
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.080]   of his conversion.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:24.120]   But the communion is a celebration of that union.
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.800]   So every time we have the communion,
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.560]   it's kind of like your anniversary.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.920]   We're anniversary, and the reason why we have anniversary
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.280]   is so that we would remember why we got together.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.640]   And every time it's the anniversary,
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.940]   you guys would write these poetic things
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.200]   about your husband and your wife,
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.800]   and how awesome it is, and how thankful you are
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:44.680]   that they met them, and they're perfect for you.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.020]   And you go through all of that,
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:50.960]   during the anniversary, to remember why you got together.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:55.840]   To remind you, because once you forget that,
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.880]   oftentimes it causes contention.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.120]   So that's what communion table is.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.660]   Communion table is to come together,
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:05.080]   this ordinance that's commanded for the purpose
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.600]   of remembering our union with Christ.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.040]   That's why we say that if you've never been baptized,
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.240]   we ask you not to come to the communion table,
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.440]   because it is a celebration of your union with Christ.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.340]   So if the union never happened, there is no power,
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:21.100]   there's no meaning behind anything that you're doing.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:24.100]   That's why during communion, we ask you to stay seated.
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:26.340]   There's no benefit to you by coming up.
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:29.820]   In fact, this is only for people who've been baptized.
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:33.040]   The second word that we use is the word sacrament.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.040]   We don't oftentimes call it sacrament in the church,
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:39.960]   but the word sacrament basically means something sacred.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:43.060]   This was not meant to be done haphazardly.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.360]   And I shared this before many times.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.360]   Earlier in the church, when I was a young pastor,
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:52.480]   I was just kind of repeating what I saw as a youth pastor.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.120]   And so we used to have the Hawaiian bread,
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.080]   and then we would have grape juice.
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.120]   And then so we would have people come up,
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.160]   and then they would take a chunk of it
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.960]   and dip it into the grape juice, and they would eat it.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.840]   And so that's how we did communion for the first,
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.000]   maybe about two to three years.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.280]   And I remember somebody came to church,
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.360]   and he said, "Should we be eating that after service?"
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.480]   I said, "What do you mean?"
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.120]   He's like, "You know, it was a communion,
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.520]   "and so because it was Hawaiian bread, it's delicious,
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.880]   "so just bring some salami, and then whatever's left over."
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.480]   You know, we're a young church,
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:27.400]   so people were just breaking it and taking pieces,
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.080]   and whatever's left over, we're drinking it.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.680]   You know, and without much thinking,
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.820]   and then that person comes like, "That sounds,
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:36.920]   "you know, that's something wrong,"
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.060]   because he came from a church
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.360]   where they were practicing it correctly.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:44.100]   And it's just sacred, should we be doing that?
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.240]   And I remember just thinking like,
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.980]   "Huh, that's a good point.
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:50.840]   "That's a really good point."
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.920]   From that day on, we stopped doing that.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.280]   'Cause he was absolutely correct.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:57.400]   This is something sacred,
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.620]   and we shouldn't be handling it that way.
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:00.120]   That's why the way we handle it,
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.440]   we make sure that if possible,
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.040]   that the pastors and the elders handle it.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.760]   It's not because we're special people.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.840]   We just wanna make sure that we understand
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.600]   that this is sacred.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.640]   And that's why Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11, 27 to 30,
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.100]   "Therefore, whoever eats the bread
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:16.760]   "and drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:19.420]   "shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:21.400]   "But a man must examine himself,
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.520]   "and in so doing, he is to eat of the bread
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.920]   "and drink of the cup.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.240]   "For he who eats and drinks,
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.960]   "eats, drinks judgment to himself
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.460]   "if he does not judge the body rightly.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:33.040]   "For this reason, many among you are weak and sick
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.240]   "and a number asleep."
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.080]   When he says sleep,
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.560]   basically he's saying there was capital punishment.
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.580]   That's how sacred this was.
[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:41.400]   When people just kind of ignore the body,
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.800]   and they were in sin,
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.480]   they were in bitterness and hatred,
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.840]   causing division,
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.480]   and they came to the communion table,
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.680]   it actually caused them to be sick.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.360]   God judged them immediately.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:55.080]   To teach the church the sacredness
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.340]   of what we're participating in.
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:59.040]   So every time we participate in this,
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.780]   we ask you to examine yourself.
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.440]   If you have bitterness,
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.560]   if you have sin in your heart
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.560]   that you're not dealing with,
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.580]   you just kind of excuse it.
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:11.900]   The communion table is to force us to deal with our sins.
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.660]   Now, whenever we say that,
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:14.500]   somebody would say,
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.340]   "You know what, I haven't been doing well,
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:18.720]   "so maybe I shouldn't participate in communion."
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.540]   If you reject the communion,
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:23.260]   you're rejecting the body of Christ.
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:25.140]   So you don't have three options.
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.220]   Like I don't believe in Christ,
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.780]   I believe in Christ,
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.260]   but I believe in Christ,
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.740]   but I'm gonna hold them off for a while.
[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:34.940]   That option's not given to us.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:39.940]   So, communion table is mandated for every Christian.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:43.740]   But as it is mandated,
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:47.820]   it is to force us to deal with unrepentant sin.
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:51.040]   Now, you're not gonna come up here because you're pure.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.340]   You're not gonna come up here because you didn't struggle.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.140]   We come here by the grace of God.
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:59.700]   You don't earn your way into the communion table,
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:04.700]   but you cannot sit there and excuse your sins
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:07.420]   and continue to embrace sin
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:08.240]   and say, "You know what,
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.080]   "I'm just gonna hold off on the communion table,
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.460]   "and then when I'm ready, I'm gonna come to Christ."
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.260]   Whether you bring God's discipline
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:18.100]   by participating in a manner unworthy,
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:20.460]   or whether you reject the body of Christ
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:23.060]   because you think, "I don't want to do that,"
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:28.040]   either way, you're inviting discipline.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.180]   And so the communion table,
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:31.780]   this sacred event,
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:35.220]   was given to us to sanctify the church,
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.660]   to make sure that when we participate in it,
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.900]   not because you're perfect, but repentant.
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:46.300]   God is calling people to this table as repentant sinners,
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:47.540]   that despite our weaknesses,
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:49.700]   despite our failures this week,
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:50.980]   that by the blood of Christ,
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:52.620]   by the grace of God,
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:53.900]   that he will make me new.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.320]   So before we open up the table,
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.860]   we ask you to take some time to pray,
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.660]   to genuinely confess,
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.980]   and to receive the Lord's forgiveness.
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:05.700]   Have every intention to reconcile.
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:09.040]   Have every intention to be made right with God.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.780]   Third and finally, the table is called a communion table,
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:12.860]   or the Lord's Supper,
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:16.540]   and the idea of that word is the body of Christ together,
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.220]   communion, right?
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:19.980]   Together union.
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:22.380]   And so that's why communion was never meant to be
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:23.540]   done in private.
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.720]   It was meant to be done publicly.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.740]   When the body of Christ is together,
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.120]   so this is not something that happens
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.780]   between husband and wife.
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.780]   This is not that something happens at our church,
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:35.580]   we don't practice this at weddings.
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:36.920]   Because it was meant to be done
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.900]   when the body of Christ is together,
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.280]   which would be Sunday morning for us.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.980]   Because it signifies that we are one in him.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.540]   In Ephesians 4, 46,
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.420]   "There is one body and one spirit,
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.640]   "just as also you were called in one hope of your calling,
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.120]   "one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.660]   "one God, Father of all,
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:59.080]   "who is over all and through all and in all."
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.780]   I'm gonna ask the praise team to come up,
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:03.500]   and we're gonna open up the communion table.
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.700]   Yeah, if we can ask the praise team to come.
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:10.740]   Because our church is getting bigger,
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:15.940]   we can easily make categories of people.
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:18.980]   These are people that I like, right?
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:21.120]   Whenever I'm with them, they're encouraging,
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.120]   I love them, they love me.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.580]   And then we have a category of people
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:27.900]   that we put in and say, these are acquaintances.
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:30.540]   I could tolerate them and they tolerate me.
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.680]   We happen to go to the same church,
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.720]   but I don't like being in their presence much.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.300]   So we tolerate, these are tolerated.
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:39.100]   And then these are my enemies.
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:44.180]   You'll never admit that,
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:47.180]   but there's some people that you're secretly hoping
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:48.580]   that they leave the church.
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:49.620]   You know what I mean?
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.340]   Then your life will be so much better.
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:53.380]   Bible study, home group, will be so much better
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:55.320]   if they just weren't in my life.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.020]   The people that we have the hardest time with,
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:03.820]   God will use to bring you to him,
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:09.860]   to expose your prejudice, your pride, your difficulty.
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:13.380]   And if you ignore that, if you're not obedient to that,
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.740]   you'll never be sanctified.
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:18.380]   Because the areas that is the hardest to sanctify,
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:19.460]   we keep ignoring.
[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:23.460]   And you know where God forces you to deal with that?
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.460]   When you get married.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.240]   So before you're married, if you have a habit
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.400]   of kind of like picking and choosing people you like
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.240]   or are uncomfortable with,
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.280]   and then you get married, all of a sudden,
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:37.760]   your husband and your wife is acting like that person
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.800]   you didn't like.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.720]   But you can't stiff arm this person anymore.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.480]   And all of a sudden, you start having marriage problems
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.280]   because what you did before you got married,
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:47.320]   you can't do with your husband
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.080]   or you're gonna ruin your marriage.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:53.960]   So God puts us in communities.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.680]   There's some people you naturally get along with.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.220]   There's some people that you kind of like,
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:58.300]   okay, you're acquaintances.
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.500]   And there's some people that is very difficult.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.780]   And that's why Jesus said,
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:07.780]   if you wanna be identified as a disciple of my disciples,
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:10.980]   he says, love as I love you.
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:15.300]   If you really wanna grow spiritually,
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:17.580]   if you really want to grow spiritually,
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:21.500]   determine to love people that you don't want to love.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:26.640]   Determine, make a decision to love people
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.640]   that you don't want to love.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.480]   And you will see how God uses that to sanctify you
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.880]   and to draw you closer to him.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.720]   So the communion table is to remind us that we're one.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.700]   Not just the close friends,
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.280]   not just the people that you like,
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.240]   but the whole community is one.
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:45.880]   So as we open up the communion table,
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.160]   we're gonna sing the song, the communion song.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.720]   And then if I can ask the elders and the pastors to come
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.900]   and open up the communion table.
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:56.540]   And then when you guys are ready, after we sing,
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:59.100]   just one by one, come up and come down the middle.
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.720]   We have the gluten-free table over here.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.940]   So if you need that, go to that table.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:04.620]   And everybody else, if you can come down the middle
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:06.180]   and then go to the side,
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:08.280]   and then we'll open it up that way, okay?
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:16.180]   (gentle piano music)

[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:11.340]   and when you're all ready,
