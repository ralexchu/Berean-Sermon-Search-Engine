[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   All right, good morning. Welcome to Breen Community Church's service. Those of
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.280]   you online as well. Let me cover over a few announcements. We have a busy week
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:34.520]   this week. We have Easter, Easter week. So normally throughout this year, I mean throughout
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:40.120]   the this time of the year. Today is Palm Sunday. It's going to kick off the Passion Week and then
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:45.880]   each day, Monday through Thursday, we're going to be having nightly devotions at 7 30 p.m to 8 30.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.040]   And so there's going to be one of the pastors or the leaders are going to be going over what Jesus
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.680]   did that day, Monday through Thursday. And then there's going to be some testimonies and so we're
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.760]   going to have normal worship. We're going to do this live, meaning that we're going to have people
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:03.240]   join here and then those of you who can't make it, we will also have live stream. So we're going to
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.000]   try to distance ourselves. If it gets too big, we're going to have people outside as well.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.600]   So this is going on from Monday, Thursday, Monday through Thursday and then Saturday,
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.480]   sorry, Friday, we're going to be having Good Friday service from 7 30 to 9 p.m. And again,
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:23.480]   we are expecting a larger number. So we'll be people here outside and possibly even upstairs.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:28.440]   We're going to be doing that this Friday and we're going to be having communion to remember Christ's
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:35.240]   death and suffering for us. And then early rise service next Sunday. We weren't able to do this
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:41.320]   last year because of the pandemic, but we are going to be having our normal early rise service at 6 a.m
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:46.280]   on the courtyard. Please try to come a little bit earlier because we're going to start right at 6 a.m
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.720]   and the service isn't going to be lasting, you know, a long time. So if you come 10, 15 minutes
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.000]   late, you're going to miss a good chunk of the service. So try to come a little bit earlier,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.960]   maybe about 10 minutes before, and then we're going to start the service right at 6 a.m. Okay.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.440]   And that'll give you plenty of time afterwards to go home, take a nap or to go out and eat and
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.320]   come back. Okay. If you're going to come to the earlier, the earlier service at nine o'clock. So
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:15.400]   again, in order to do that, we need a few more volunteers for Good Friday parking.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.960]   So the parking team has asked if we can get a few more people to volunteer, come a little bit
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:25.960]   earlier and direct traffic that day and also for Easter Sunday service as well. So if you are able
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.920]   to sign up, come a little bit earlier to help with that, please let them know. And again, the signup
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.160]   sheets will be on the Facebook or you can ask one of the welcome team members and they'll be able to
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:41.880]   direct you toward the right place. And again, another one, a Berean membership class. So if
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.520]   you are applying to become a member and this is not a, you know, basic Christianity class, but a
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:52.280]   Berean membership class, the new one is going to be starting on April 18th. So it's going to be in
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:19:00.680]   a few weeks. It happens on Sunday morning upstairs and at nine to 1030 a.m. for eight weeks. So if
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.520]   you are interested in becoming a member or you know someone that, that wants to take that class
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:11.000]   to become a member, contact Pastor Nate and his email, again, I have it, but you don't have it,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.480]   but it'd be on Facebook. Just let them know. And again, let the welcome team know and they'll
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:21.240]   direct you to the right place to do that. Okay. All right. So after I pray for the offering,
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.280]   we have our brother, Brian Lee, who's going to come and give his testimony. He'll be baptized
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.760]   this morning. Okay. Let's pray for the offering. Again, those of you who are online and those of
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.200]   you who are here, you can give electronically and then the physical offering box is in the
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:44.040]   back over there. Okay. All right. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we pray and invite you, Lord God,
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:53.240]   asking you to mold us, renew us, strengthen us and revive us. We thank you for what this week
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:20:00.280]   represents for all of us. Help us, Lord God, not to simply participate, Lord, in a religious manner
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:07.240]   or out of duty, but I pray that you would renew our hearts, renew our commitment, and that every
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.800]   part of what we do would cause us, Lord God, to be softened, that we may be molded as you are the
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:18.280]   powder and we are the clay. We ask, Lord, that you would anoint even our offering. Help us to give it
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.560]   to you as an act of worship, act of surrender, acknowledging your lordship over our lives.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:29.800]   It may be multiplied for your use that the gospel may continue to spread and that more and more
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:37.160]   people may know what you have done for us. So we pray for grace and guidance. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.680]   Church family, let's all rise together as we come before God and singing.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:15.560]   Sing, "Lord, you're calling."
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:28.840]   Lord, you're calling me to come and behold the wondrous cross to explore the depths of grace
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:40.200]   came to me at such a cost where your boundless love conquered my boundless sin

[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:13.240]   into the glory of Calvary

[00:26:49.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   there's a place where sin and shame are found within us where my heart is pleased with God and forgiveness
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:29.480]   where all the love I've ever found comes like a flood comes flowing down
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:49.480]   at the cross at the cross I surrender my life I'm in of you I'm in of you where your love ran red and my sin washed white
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:28:09.480]   I owe all to you I owe all to you hear my hopeless cry hear our holy cry hear I bow hear I bow
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:21.480]   hear your arms open wide hear you say my life hear I bow hear I bow
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:41.480]   at the cross at the cross I surrender my life I'm in of you I'm in of you where your love ran red and my sin washed white
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:29:01.480]   I owe all to you I owe all to you at the cross at the cross I surrender my life I'm in of you I'm in of you
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:19.480]   where your love ran red and my sin washed white I owe all to you I owe all to you Jesus
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.480]   may be seated
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:33.480]   amen
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:57.480]   hi Berean family my name is Brian Lay and I'm a fourth year at the Berean College Ministry and I'd like to share how God has worked in my life
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:07.480]   so it's hard to know what life was like without knowing God because all my life I felt that God was always there I was raised in a Christian household
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:17.480]   my mom would take us to church every Sunday we'd have nightly bible studies and we'd pray every night I grew up with friends and family who were Christian
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:27.480]   and it felt like I was surrounded by God's love during this time I remember absorbing all the things from church and the things that my mom was teaching me
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   and I took them as truth because that was the only thing I knew I was challenged though early on that I had to make my faith my own and that this can't just be second handed for me
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   but even with that naturally I'm just a very obedient person and I like to please my parents and so even making faith my own felt a little forced as well
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:31:01.480]   however there were times though growing up in middle school high school where I felt convicted by the gospel and God's gift of salvation
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   I remember at a retreat I thought that I felt God's love and the idea of Jesus sacrificing himself on the cross really compelled me
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:20.480]   and so my eyes were really open to just sin in my life and what Jesus did on the cross
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:33.480]   as growing up I didn't really see my own sin I thought just because I grew up in a Christian household that I was inherently saved but that was far from the case
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:48.480]   I was a sinner and I was against God and just because I may have grew up set apart I still needed to look deep into my own sin
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   and that was kind of shown throughout high school where at my home church things changed leadership changed and every Sunday it started becoming just topical
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:09.480]   and it was very devoid of scripture and bible and I knew that this was wrong I knew that at this church I wasn't being spiritually fed
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   and the only reason why I stayed was because of the friends that I had made since childhood and so even because of this I still continued to stay and I didn't even pursue God on my own
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:32.480]   however I knew that as humans we would sin and I always thought that even though I was a sinner God's grace he forgives us
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:41.480]   and even though that's true I neglected the importance of genuine repentance and fully surrendering myself to Jesus and that would break the cycle of sin
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:51.480]   and so in college I started going to a bible teaching church but I failed to really integrate myself in the community
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:33:00.480]   and so each Sunday I would just go receiving head knowledge of the bible and the scripture but never actually applying it in my life
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:07.480]   and it wasn't until I came to Marin just this year that I really felt convicted by what God was telling me
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:23.480]   that before God I stand before a righteous God and that I am fully just and through his son's sacrifice that I can now have that relationship with him
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:33.480]   and that was something that I failed to connect all those years before that now talking to God is not just someone I'm speaking out just randomly or blindly
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:39.480]   but I now have a relationship with him and that has been restored through Jesus' sacrifice
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:46.480]   and so from that I really started to see fruit in my life where I didn't see before
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:55.480]   now I have a need to spread the gospel whenever I can to any unbelieving friends or family
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:09.480]   just having now I have that faith even though before in college where it was just idle and dry and I would use Christianity as a crutch
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:19.480]   now I see it as my faith is unshaken I can completely devote my life to God and now I know that I am filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.480]   and not something that I'm just surrounded by just because of friends and family
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:31.480]   I have now a desire to build my relationship with Jesus because I want to read intently his word
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:38.480]   I know that my body was purchased by the death of Jesus and I need to submit to him through complete surrenderance and devotion to Christ
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:44.480]   I want to strive to become a better brother, a better son, not just in my family but with Christ
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:50.480]   and I know that truly it's only through Christ that I can accomplish all these things
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   and everything I do is for the glory of God
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:59.480]   now looking back at my life I know that God has been sovereign everywhere
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.480]   just from my upbringing, from where I went to church, to who I made friends with
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:08.480]   I know that his perfect plan has brought me from death and into his loving presence
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.480]   and the greatest showcase of his love I think is from Romans 5a where he says
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.480]   in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.480]   Thank you
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   [applause]
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:45.480]   Brian, you understand when you go into the water you're united with Christ in his death
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.480]   and when you come out you're united to his resurrected life
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.480]   I do
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.480]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:36:06.480]   [applause]
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:15.480]   Okay, thank you. If we can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 19
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:25.480]   I want to read Luke chapter 19 verse 28 through 44
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:32.480]   and then I'm not going to read it but the text that we're going to be in this morning is in Zechariah
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:37.480]   Luke chapter 19 verse 28 through 44
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   Reading out of the NASB
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.480]   After he had said these things he was going on ahead going up to Jerusalem
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:53.480]   when he approached Bethphage and Bethany near the mount that is called Olivet
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:57.480]   he sent two of the disciples saying, "Go into the village ahead of you
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   there as you enter you will find a cold tide on which no one yet has ever sat
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.480]   untie it and bring it here
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:09.480]   if anyone asks you why are you untying it you shall say the Lord has need of it
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.480]   so those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:18.480]   as they were untying the coat its owner said to them why are you untying the coat
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.480]   they said the Lord has need of it
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:25.480]   they brought it to Jesus and they threw their coats on the coat and put Jesus on it
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.480]   as he was going they were spreading their coats on the road
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.480]   as soon as he was approaching near the descent of the mount of Olives
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.480]   the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.480]   with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   shouting blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.480]   peace in heaven glory in the highest
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:46.480]   some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him teacher rebuke your disciples
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:51.480]   but Jesus answered I tell you if these become silent the stones will cry out
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.480]   when he approached Jerusalem he saw the city and wept over it saying
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   if you had known in this day even you the things which make for peace
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:03.480]   but now they have been hidden from your eyes for the days will come upon you
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:07.480]   when your enemies will throw a barricade against you and wrestle around you
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   and hem you in every side and they will level you to the ground
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.480]   and your children within you and they will not leave in you one stone upon another
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.480]   because you did not recognize the time of your visitation let's pray
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:27.480]   Heavenly Father we pray for guidance we pray for your Holy Spirit to convict and lead us
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   I pray that your word would make sense
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.480]   that would cause us Lord God to see the depth of your grace and love for us
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.480]   Lord as we begin this Passion Week with Palm Sunday
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.480]   help us to understand what you were doing what you are doing
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.480]   that our hearts may be surrendered to you we pray for your blessing over this time
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.480]   in Jesus name we pray amen
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:54.480]   you know as I've already said this is a very busy week you know
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.480]   probably the busiest week out of the whole year for us as a church
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.480]   because every single day we have something filled
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.480]   and so at the end of it usually Sunday night you know we're
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.480]   especially the pastoral staff and the leaders are pretty exhausted
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.480]   you know and I'm sure you guys are exhausted you know Sunday morning
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.480]   we wake up early in the morning give our devotion and
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.480]   and then you know there's a lot of things going on this week
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.480]   and the reason why we do this every year is because
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.480]   our natural tendency is to drift
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.480]   you know the whole thing that we've been talking about in Hebrews
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.480]   is our natural tendency is we get caught up and tangled with
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.480]   you know everyday things and raising children paying bills
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:39.480]   concerned about what's going on whether it's political economical
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.480]   and so our natural tendency is to just kind of drift from God
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.480]   so God tells the nation of Israel all these
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:51.480]   things that he plays all these rituals and sacrifices and festivals
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:55.480]   in order to cause them to stop break into their normal routine
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.480]   and for them to remember what God has done
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.480]   because their natural tendency is to forget
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   especially this year right because the pandemic
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.480]   you know when we survey the church when we survey what's going on outside the church
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.480]   we hear a lot of people saying that they're fatigued they're tired they're distracted
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:17.480]   and I'm sure most of you are sick and tired of being on the zoom
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.480]   you know we're just waiting for us to get to what is it orange and then hopefully yellow
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.480]   soon you know and then whatever normal is to get back to normal
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.480]   so we don't have to be wearing these silly masks you know that we'd be done away with
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.480]   but in the midst of all that's been going on
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.480]   and it's not just because of the pandemic our natural tendency is
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.480]   when we are not striving after God we don't drift toward God
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.480]   we don't sit there and get entangled and get busy and take care of our children
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.480]   and then wake up six months later and say oh I feel this passion for Christ
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:54.480]   we don't drift toward God we drift away from God
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.480]   so if we're not deliberate about keeping our heart focused on Christ
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:02.480]   if we're not deliberate about anchoring ourselves to Christ we naturally
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:06.480]   have a tendency to drift and so these times are very
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.480]   important for us in order for us to renew our first love we can go through the rituals
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.480]   like yeah I've been coming up to Bible study I haven't missed church and I haven't done I haven't missed this
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.480]   and I haven't missed that but again our natural tendency
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:22.480]   is to to the minimum we just kind of go through the motion
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   we check out the box but at the end we find our hearts so hardened
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.480]   away from God and sometimes we get so hardened that we even
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.480]   question do I even believe this? So we want to take
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:38.480]   this time this week Monday through Friday
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.480]   going over each day and I hope that what you get
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:46.480]   out of it this week is not simply logically oh this is
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.480]   what happened in history this is what he did in the first day second day third day
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.480]   hopefully through each of these events that you recognize that Christ
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:58.480]   was deliberately walking toward the cross and how each
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.480]   one of these events led him to that point so that when we come and have communion
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:06.480]   on Friday that communion that we really have a rich understanding
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.480]   of what it is that we're participating and we're hoping that by next Sunday when we
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.480]   come to celebrate Easter that our singing would be louder than normal
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:18.480]   right that our praising would be louder than our usual way
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:22.480]   of singing that hopefully it'll kind of cause us to be focused
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:26.480]   and to renew our first love toward Christ so
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.480]   today is Palm Sunday Palm Sunday is the kick off of the day where Jesus is
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.480]   deliberately riding on his donkey headed toward Jerusalem
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:38.480]   and the reason why this is so significant is up to all up to this point
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.480]   Jesus was very very quiet about his identity even
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.480]   though the crescendo of excitement toward him has been
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.480]   growing and and it's it's headed toward that place
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.480]   his riding on the donkey was a very
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.480]   deliberate act where he's going to start the
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.480]   you know knock the first domino and in each domino that
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   again is going to that's going to fall is going to ultimately lead him toward that cross
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   you know in the Bible in the
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.480]   in the four Gospels there's maybe about 10 to 12 major
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.480]   events that are recorded on all four Gospels so we know that every one of these
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.480]   events are extremely important because as you guys know
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.480]   each one of these Gospels are different eyewitnesses different
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.480]   testimonies where you have Matthew Mark Luke and John giving different a Jewish
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:34.480]   angle a Gentile angle you know Jesus's humanity angle his deity
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.480]   angle and so each one of these angles highlight different aspects
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.480]   of Jesus's identity and what he has done that's why even though they're talking about the same
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:46.480]   life of Jesus that you're going to hear different things so
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   when something is repeated you know it's important it was important enough
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   that they all highlighted it the triumphal entry is
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.480]   one of those events one of those dozen events that are highlighted but among
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   the same events if you look at the four Gospels you'll notice that there
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:06.480]   are certain things that one person emphasizes and certain things that another person does
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:10.480]   not include this triumphal entry even though
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.480]   they have they talk about different angles there's one event in the triumphal entry
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:18.480]   that is mentioned in detail in all four Gospels
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.480]   and that detail is Jesus getting the donkey and riding
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.480]   that donkey into Jerusalem so all the
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:30.480]   things that could have been highlighted in him coming into Jerusalem telling his
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.480]   disciples to go get the donkey and then to tell them what they're going to say why are
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.480]   you taking my donkey? Well the Lord has need of it and it's all okay
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   that's recorded in all four Gospels so
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.480]   what is the significance of this donkey that is highlighted in this detail
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.480]   in all four Gospels so what I want to go over this morning
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.480]   is to go over the three aspects that
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:58.480]   Jesus was declaring and he was fulfilling in the riding of the donkey
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.480]   there is it is not some random event that takes place oh he came into Jerusalem
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:06.480]   he just happened to be riding on a donkey there's something about this
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.480]   riding of the donkey that was highlighted for us that we are to take some time
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   to examine carefully what is its significance so
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.480]   first one why did he ride the donkey number one
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:22.480]   Jesus rode the donkey to fulfill biblical prophecy
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:26.480]   in Zechariah chapter 9 verse 9 it says rejoice greatly oh daughter of Zion
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:30.480]   shout in triumph oh daughter of Jerusalem behold your king is coming to you
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.480]   he is just and endowed with salvation humble and mounted on a
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.480]   donkey even on a colt the fold of a donkey he was fulfilling
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.480]   that particular prophecy he was declaring
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.480]   to all the people who have gathered together I am that guy I am the
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.480]   Messiah up to this point Jesus was very hush hush about his identity
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.480]   remember every time he would fulfill a some sort of miracle he
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.480]   would tell his disciples to keep it quiet remember the very first miracle
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.480]   of turning water into wine Jesus tells his mother why do you
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   involve me it is not my time so up to this point
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.480]   he would perform these miracles and people would say he must be he must be
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   but he never clearly said publicly to everybody that this is
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.480]   who he is he kind of kept it quiet because he knew once his identity
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.480]   came out that the first domino falls that
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   it's going to lead him directly to the cross but this prophecy
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.480]   of him riding on a donkey was not just in Zechariah in fact even
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.480]   before that all the way up to Genesis chapter 49 verse 10 through
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.480]   11 Jacob at the end of his life is giving blessing
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.480]   to his 12 children and in his blessing he gets to
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.480]   Judah and he says this the scepter shall not depart from Judah
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.480]   in other words you're going to be a kingly line nor the ruler's staff
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.480]   between his feet until Shiloh comes and Shiloh is
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:58.480]   in reference to the Messiah and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.480]   he ties his fold to the vine and his donkey's coat to the choice
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   vine he washes his garments in wine and his robes in the blood
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.480]   of grapes did you see that even as early as his blessing to Judah
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:14.480]   it's clearly spelled out that when the Messiah comes
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:18.480]   he's going to be riding on a donkey he's going to again talking about the
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.480]   vine and the wine meaning his blood being spilled that
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:26.480]   he's going to come and to take his place
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:30.480]   so this was not new to the Jews
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.480]   they've been saying like how are you going to recognize the Messiah well he's going to have
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.480]   the words of God he's going to perform some miracles but when you see a man
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:42.480]   coming into Jerusalem riding on a donkey you know that that is going to
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:46.480]   be fulfilled so Jesus for the first time in ministry is
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:50.480]   publicly declaring to everybody there I am that man
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.480]   see it was
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:58.480]   a very deliberate act what happens this week
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:02.480]   didn't happen to him he just it wasn't
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:06.480]   that he made some poor choices and maybe he shouldn't have cleansed the temple
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:10.480]   and he got the you know the leaders angry and that's why they did that maybe
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.480]   he shouldn't have chosen Judas and betray him maybe he shouldn't have been
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:18.480]   praying out there at night it didn't happen to him Jesus says
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.480]   by his own words no one takes my life I lay it down on my
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:26.480]   own accord and I take it up he says he did it he
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:30.480]   planned to do it in fact the Bible has over 300 different
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.480]   prophecies about Jesus' life his disciples his birth
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.480]   the place of birth betrayal crucifixion how he's going to be crucified
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:42.480]   his resurrection over 300 prophecies that were given
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.480]   in the Old Testament that Jesus fulfilled in his birth life
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   ministry death and resurrection meaning
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.480]   every part of what Jesus was doing was planned and was
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.480]   very deliberate in Numbers chapter
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.480]   23 verse 19 it says God is not man that he should lie
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:06.480]   nor the son of man that he should repent has he said and will he not do it or has
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.480]   he spoken and will he not make it good
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.480]   whenever you go on a job interview right you want to know is he faithful can
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   we rely on that person does he say what he says he's going to do
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.480]   or maybe you have friends or maybe you have people in your community
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.480]   but if he says it you can trust him if she says it you can trust him
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.480]   so this statement in and of itself is a beautiful
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:34.480]   statement that God does what he says he's going to do
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.480]   so without any context that statement alone is a very
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.480]   honorable respectable character to have but when you
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:46.480]   put that in the context of Israel's history
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:50.480]   when you put that in the context of our own history that because
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:54.480]   God said he will do it think about how many times
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:58.480]   in Israel's history that God would have had every right to revoke
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:02.480]   his promise I mean we don't have to go that far
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.480]   every single king in Israel's history almost every single king
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.480]   was evil and they led them astray they committed horrendous
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:14.480]   acts of idolatry any part of Israel's history during the
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.480]   kings he could have just stepped in and said that's enough
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:22.480]   the book of Judges any one of those times oh maybe
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.480]   through the desert they were faithful have you read the book of numbers
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:30.480]   if you look at Israel's history from the moment that they are
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.480]   conceived until the end of the Old Testament
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:38.480]   every part of it is a list of every curse that
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:42.480]   they deserve so before they go in God said if you
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:46.480]   live righteously here's the blessing if you live unrighteously here's the
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:50.480]   curse and so if you look at the history from that point on it's curse
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.480]   after curse after curse after curse so when you look at
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.480]   the statement numbers 23 verse 19 in the context of Israel's history
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:02.480]   not even when they were in Egypt were they faithful not even prior to Egypt
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:06.480]   were they faithful even the patriarchs if we study them carefully they weren't
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   necessarily great men and yet God
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.480]   says because I made my promise I will fulfill it
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.480]   we don't even have to look at the Israelites look at ourselves
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:22.480]   look at ourselves not only before we met Christ after we
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:26.480]   met Christ when you look at your life carefully
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:30.480]   like how many events in your life can you examine
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:34.480]   and say you know what I didn't deserve the grace of God
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.480]   God shouldn't have been patient with me how many times in our
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:42.480]   lives could we stand before God saying you know what I did good
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.480]   I am righteous I deserve the grace of God if we're honest
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:50.480]   with ourselves we're no different than the Israelites and the only reason
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.480]   why we celebrate this week is because God said he would be
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:58.480]   faithful despite us and so everything that takes place
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:02.480]   in this week is God's intentional plan
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.480]   to go to the cross for our sins see this Palm
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:10.480]   Sunday is the first domino that falls you know it's kind of like
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:14.480]   the cat's out of the bag right like when we have
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:18.480]   DTR determining the relationship those of you who are young
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   and cool and hip okay DTR when you have feelings for
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:26.480]   somebody and you contemplate should I tell her should I not tell her
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.480]   and then so when is the right time should I am I going to get rejected and so
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:34.480]   you contemplate all of that and you weigh the pros and cons and you know you
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:38.480]   gear up and then because you know once it comes out of your mouth you can't take it back
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:42.480]   again I've shared before about how I approached
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.480]   Esther and so I waited a year and a half of praying is it the right
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.480]   time not right time resisting and finally she's going to go to Boston to go to some
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.480]   college and so I thought maybe this is the right time
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.480]   and thinking that maybe we're on the same page maybe she's dropping
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.480]   hints and so okay okay I'm taking her and then I asked her what are you
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:06.480]   thinking about me and she's like a brother
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:10.480]   right it wasn't what I wanted to hear and so there was obviously
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:14.480]   misunderstanding but I remember when she said that
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:18.480]   my heart just dropped because I prepared for so long
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.480]   and it's like man if I knew that this was the
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:26.480]   answer that was going to come I probably wouldn't have gone through the trouble to say this
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:30.480]   but too late the cat's out of the bag so I used to
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.480]   have a discipler he used to always say
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:38.480]   if a guy takes out a sword he should at least cut his toenails
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:42.480]   you have to like let it sink in okay
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:46.480]   in other words if you're ready for battle you should at least
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:50.480]   cut your toenails like you should use the sword right anyway if you don't understand what that
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.480]   means I remember him saying that and saying well the cat's
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.480]   out of the bag might as well go forward right and so that's
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:02.480]   how we got started and I just told her well it's too late now so this is how I feel
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:06.480]   and I want to marry you what do you think about that right so I went forward
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:10.480]   and that's how we got here by the grace of God right
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:14.480]   so this Palm Sunday is God
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:18.480]   deliberately knocking down the first
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.480]   domino and this is going to cause the
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.480]   crowds to be stirred the leaders to pay attention because they've been trying
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.480]   to get to him for a long time but now Jesus is saying here I am
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.480]   and there's a reason why he goes to the temple as soon as he goes to Jerusalem because he's
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:38.480]   challenging the leaders and publicly saying I'm here
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:42.480]   you've been looking for me I'm here
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.480]   this is Palm Sunday Jesus deliberately and willfully
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:50.480]   walking into danger because he knows that this is going to lead him to the cross
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:54.480]   he's riding on this donkey to fulfill that
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:58.480]   promise that prophecy to let people know
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:02.480]   that it's time secondly Jesus
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:06.480]   rode the donkey to establish his kingdom
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:10.480]   you know people often think like Jesus is the humble servant
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:14.480]   but in Zechariah 9 verse 9 and 10 it says rejoice greatly
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.480]   O daughter of Zion shout in triumph O daughter of Jerusalem behold your king
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:22.480]   is coming to you your king is
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:26.480]   coming to you he is just and endowed with salvation humble mounted on a donkey even
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:30.480]   on a colt the fall of a donkey I will cut off the cherry from Ephraim and the
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:34.480]   horse from Jerusalem and the bow of war will be cut off and he will
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:38.480]   speak peace to the nations and his dominion will be from sea to
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:42.480]   sea and from the river to ends of the earth
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:46.480]   see during times of war typically the king
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:50.480]   would be riding on his horse to exemplify power and
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.480]   authority but in times of peace the king would be riding on a
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:58.480]   donkey so it wasn't unusual for a king to be on a donkey
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:02.480]   in fact in 1st King chapter 133-34
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:06.480]   when David is anointing his son Solomon to be king
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:10.480]   he puts him on a donkey and parades him in 33
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:14.480]   it says the king said to them David said to them take with you the servants of your lord
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:18.480]   and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule and bring him
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.480]   down to Gihon let Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet anoint him
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:26.480]   there as king over Israel and blow the trumpet and say long live
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:30.480]   king Solomon so it was a very common practice
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:34.480]   in Israel to have the kings riding on the donkey to be anointed
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:38.480]   so when Jesus came on a donkey he wasn't simply refusing his kingdom
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:42.480]   he was actually declaring the king has arrived
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:46.480]   he was making it very clear that that's who he is
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:50.480]   you have to understand that the people were
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:54.480]   very eager to make him king see they weren't resisting
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:58.480]   him as a king because they wanted him to be king remember after he feeds the 5000
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.480]   they're so enamored with him they wanted to forcefully make him king
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:06.480]   so Jesus had to break away from them so they didn't have a problem
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:10.480]   with making him king because they thought if they made him king
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:14.480]   I mean he's opening the eyes of blind people
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:18.480]   women who are hemorrhaging for years get healed
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:22.480]   lepers who couldn't join their families were walking back into their homes
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.480]   and able to go to the temple anybody who's hungry
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:30.480]   he just breaks the bread and just give it to them and they eat you get free
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.480]   Medicare you get free food
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:38.480]   you get to go back to the temple you're restored to your family
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:42.480]   I mean if this guy's our king we're set
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:46.480]   in fact when Jesus came in and he was under the trial with Pontius Pilate
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:50.480]   he said they are saying that you are the king of the Jews
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:54.480]   are you he and Jesus says it is as you say
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:58.480]   Jesus was not forsaking his kingship
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.480]   Jesus says it's actually publicly declaring
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.480]   I am the king but the problem
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:10.480]   is what they wanted from their king was to
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:14.480]   come and fight for them because they thought
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:18.480]   that if their king came just like Moses delivered
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.480]   the Israelites from the Egyptians that our Messiah and our king
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   is going to come and he's going to fight for us and he's going to put us in this right place
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.480]   but Jesus says in John 18 36 Jesus answered my kingdom is not
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:34.480]   of this world if my kingdom were of this world
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:38.480]   then my servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:42.480]   but as it is my kingdom is not of this world
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:46.480]   think about how much energy is being poured right now
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:50.480]   to make this kingdom this earthly kingdom a better place
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:54.480]   because we think if we if we love Jesus
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:58.480]   we need to unite and fight for these causes because we want this kingdom
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:02.480]   to be the place that we want to live
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:06.480]   that's exactly what the Jews were wanting and begging because they thought that when Jesus
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:10.480]   came whatever oppression that they felt
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:14.480]   whatever disenfranchisement that they felt because they were being treated as second, third, fourth
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:18.480]   class citizens in the Roman kingdom so if Messiah comes
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:22.480]   he's going to deliver us from that so that we can have the same benefits as the Roman citizens
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:26.480]   we can go where we need to go we can have our children go to the schools that they want to go
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:30.480]   so we need the Messiah to make this right
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:34.480]   and that's why they were so excited in fact the book of Matthew says
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:38.480]   the excitement was so great there was a seismic stir where we get the word
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:42.480]   seismology an earthquake in fact they said
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:46.480]   many historians think that there were probably close to
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:50.480]   two million people in Jerusalem and the way that they calculate that is
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:54.480]   they have a record of how many lambs were killed during the Passover
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.480]   and so there's ten people usually you would need one lamb for every ten
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:02.480]   person and so they calculated all of it and they said it could have been
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.480]   as many as two million if they go by the number of the lambs the lowest number
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:10.480]   I've seen is somewhere around 250 to 500,000 people
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.480]   whether you believe it's 250,000 or two million people there was a tremendous
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.480]   number of people in Jerusalem and on top of that Jesus just healed
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.480]   Lazarus a very prominent person and so
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.480]   this rumor started to spread is he the Messiah is he the Messiah
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:30.480]   and they said well he healed Lazarus he actually even raised somebody from the dead
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.480]   so all these people came into town thinking
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.480]   finally our king is coming and he's
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.480]   going to overthrow the Romans and put us in the right place
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:46.480]   see Jesus came and he wasn't resisting
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.480]   his kingship but the problem was his kingdom is not
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.480]   of this world see they wanted to get going remember
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.480]   Peter himself that's what was in his mind at Gethsemane when the
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.480]   guards of the temple came remember Peter
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.480]   that's what he was thinking too he took out his sword he was ready to fight he's a fisherman
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.480]   he doesn't know how to wield a sword right
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.480]   so he swings and he misses and he cuts the ear
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.480]   it's very comical and all it says is
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:22.480]   Jesus picked it up and put it back on
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.480]   Peter was ready to fight because that's what all the Jews were thinking
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:30.480]   now is it now you want me to take the sword out now
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.480]   and Jesus said something weird that they didn't understand he who lives by the sword
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.480]   shall die by the sword okay so we're not going to use swords
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.480]   maybe spears like what what are we
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:46.480]   we're about to fight right we have our general we have our king
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.480]   they didn't understand and when Jesus
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.480]   said if this was my kingdom I don't need you
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:58.480]   you guys can't even get along
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.480]   I don't need you I will bring angels of my own
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.480]   and wipe them out I don't need a tiny sword that can't
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.480]   even hit the middle of the head and cut off people's ears I don't need soldiers like you
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.480]   he said but this is not my kingdom
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.480]   that I came to fight for Colossians 1.13 for he
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:22.480]   rescued us from the domain of darkness transferred us to the kingdom of his
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:26.480]   beloved son we're in the kingdom of his beloved son he's our king now
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:30.480]   see this kingdom that we
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.480]   are a part of is already perfect because we have the
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.480]   perfect ruler this kingdom is already economically perfect
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.480]   because he's our ruler the only problem that we have is
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.480]   we keep reaching back to the old kingdom we keep wanting to live in both
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.480]   kingdoms but Jesus says I have come to establish my kingdom
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.480]   Hebrews 4.16 it says therefore let us draw near with the confidence to the throne
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.480]   of grace so that we may receive mercy and find grace and help of need
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   notice here he says to draw near to what to the throne
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.480]   of grace to the kingdom
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:10.480]   where our Lord reigns
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:14.480]   we get into so much trouble because we think
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.480]   that the greatest need of our generation
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.480]   greatest need for us for our children for our future is to make the right decision
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:26.480]   have the right leaders have the right people have the right family and if we do that
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:30.480]   then we will be good
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:34.480]   do you remember in 1st Samuel chapter 8 verse 7 where the Israelites
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.480]   are demanding a king for themselves and Samuel is offended by that
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.480]   because God was ruling through his prophets
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:46.480]   but said no all of our problem is because we don't have a king like they do
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:50.480]   if we had the king that they had we wouldn't have this
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.480]   problem so they demanded to have a king of their own and God says to Samuel
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.480]   in verse 7 the Lord said to Samuel listen to the voice of people in regard to all
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.480]   that they say to you for they have not rejected you but they have rejected
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.480]   me from being king over them
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.480]   this is why they miss Jesus
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.480]   because the kingdom that they were thinking about and they thought the solution was
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.480]   that somehow God helped us to get the king that we want
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:22.480]   sometimes we think of lordship as we
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.480]   these are the things this is what I think is going to make me happy and then we come to Jesus
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.480]   like please help me help me pay my bills help me
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.480]   have peace help me for my family help me to do this and Jesus becomes nothing more
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.480]   than a cosmic bellhop that comes and is just waiting to serve us
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.480]   he's a holy servant just waiting what do you want
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:46.480]   oh what's going on oh you're sad are you hungry
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:50.480]   he came to establish his kingdom
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.480]   and that's what the riding of the donkey was I am the king
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:58.480]   see if we're not careful
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.480]   we embrace Jesus as our savior
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.480]   but we reject him as our king because a
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:10.480]   savior doesn't demand undivided loyalty
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.480]   because he saves us he just comes to save us he just forgives
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:18.480]   us but a king does
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.480]   a savior does not judge your spending habits
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:26.480]   but the king does a savior does not ask for obedience
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:30.480]   but the king does
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:34.480]   if you do not know king Jesus you may
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.480]   not know the savior Jesus because they are the same person
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:42.480]   you don't embrace the cross
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:46.480]   and then reject his kingdom you don't
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.480]   embrace Jesus as my servant and he serves me and he loves me
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.480]   cares for me and then you know nothing about the kingship of Christ
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.480]   see the donkey represented his kingship
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:02.480]   to establish his throne
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:06.480]   third and finally Jesus rode the donkey to ultimately
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.480]   bring peace in Zechariah 9 10 it says I will cut off
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.480]   the chariots from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem and the bow of war
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:18.480]   will be cut off and he will speak peace to the nations
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.480]   he's going to come as a king humbled on a donkey but the
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.480]   purpose of all of this he says is to bring peace in fact
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:30.480]   remember when I read Genesis 49 10
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:34.480]   this prophecy of the coming Messiah he says the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor the rulers
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.480]   sat between his feet until Shiloh comes and the word Shiloh in Hebrew
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:42.480]   means tranquility peace
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:46.480]   in Isaiah Jesus is called the prince of peace
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:50.480]   the irony of all of this
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:54.480]   is that that's exactly what the Jews wanted
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.480]   they wanted peace in fact they wanted it so much
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:02.480]   that every time they greeted each other they would say Shalom
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.480]   Shalom to you and then the person receiving that will say again
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:10.480]   Shalom to you and so for generations after generations
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:14.480]   they would say peace peace but the word Shalom means more than simple
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:18.480]   peace it was understood that when God
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:22.480]   brings peace when he gives you peace that there's going to be wholeness
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:26.480]   whatever is broken is going to be mended whatever
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:30.480]   has gone wrong is going to be fixed it means to be complete
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.480]   to be whole you know what's interesting
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:38.480]   is that the Muslim world they greet each other in similar fashion
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:42.480]   if you have any Muslim friends the way they greet you is
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:46.480]   Malekka Asalam right oh Asalam Malekko
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.480]   that's what it says Asalam Malekko basically means peace be unto you
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.480]   and then the person receiving that will say Malekko Asalam
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.480]   meaning unto you peace in reverse
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:02.480]   so that's the way that the Muslim world greets each other
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.480]   so the Jews would greet each other say Shalom and the Muslims will greet each other by saying
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.480]   peace unto you and the irony of all of this
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:14.480]   is that even though we you and I may not say peace unto you when we say
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.480]   happy new year or happy birthday right blessings to you
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:22.480]   we mean the same thing like we want
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.480]   to be whole we want whatever has gone wrong to be fixed
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:30.480]   if you are sick to be healed if you're having financial problems
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:34.480]   hopefully in the new year God will bless you with money
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.480]   whatever has gone wrong God bless you and so
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:42.480]   that's what we mean Shalom and that's what they mean when they say Shalom
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.480]   and the irony of all of this is that as they were desperately waiting
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.480]   for the king and as they were desperately waiting for
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:54.480]   peace in Luke chapter 19 41 to 42
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.480]   as Jesus is riding on the donkey with the seismic stir
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.480]   of possibly up to 2 million people waving the palm branches receiving
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:06.480]   their king we find Jesus weeping in verse
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.480]   41 when he approached Jerusalem he saw the city and wept
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:14.480]   over it saying if you had known in this day
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:18.480]   even you the things which make for peace but now they have been
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:22.480]   hidden from your eyes what they have
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:26.480]   desperately so wanted they completely missed
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:30.480]   and they ended up crucifying him
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.480]   so much of our lives is seeking peace
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.480]   if you came from a poor family
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.480]   you think man if I just make money and I don't want to have the
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:46.480]   turmoil that my parents went through so if I can just have a
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.480]   successful business I will have peace if my children
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:54.480]   go to the right school under the right politicians
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:58.480]   I would have peace
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:02.480]   if I just had the right friends right environment
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.480]   the right neighborhood and the right house I will have peace
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.480]   and so we strive from place to place and there is so much
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:14.480]   talk right now about going to different states to find peace
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.480]   and if we are not careful if we are not careful we will
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.480]   fall under the same delusion as the Jews as they were waiting
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:26.480]   for the king and wanting so much to have peace thinking that somehow
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.480]   if they change if they move the puzzles around and bought the
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.480]   house in the right place and went to the right area our children would have peace
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.480]   I would have peace I would be able to worship God in peace raise our children in peace
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:42.480]   retire in peace
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.480]   in the middle of seeking peace they completely
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.480]   missed the prince of peace
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.480]   you remember in Genesis chapter 22
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:58.480]   where Isaiah is
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.480]   called or Abraham is called to
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:06.480]   sacrifice Isaiah and we know this whole event
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.480]   is a fulfillment of that promise as Abraham takes up the
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.480]   knife to strike him down just as God told him to
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:18.480]   God says stop and he says I will provide
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.480]   and that is exactly what he is doing this week he is fulfilling
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.480]   that promise that he made and he will take the place of
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:30.480]   Isaac to be that sacrifice
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.480]   in Genesis chapter 22 verse 3 it says this so Abraham rose early
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:38.480]   in the morning and saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.480]   and Isaac his son
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.480]   Isaac rode that donkey to go to the cross
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:50.480]   see him being on that donkey not only
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:54.480]   represented his public and
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.480]   specific fulfillment of his will it wasn't just simply to him
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:02.480]   to declare his kingship it was to bring
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.480]   peace that only he could bring in Ephesians 2 17
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.480]   he came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.480]   were near again in Ephesians 6 15
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.480]   talking about the gospel your feet will be preparation for the gospel of
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.480]   peace in the last
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:26.480]   year or two years we have been hearing that phrase no
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:30.480]   justice no peace no justice no peace
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:34.480]   and we are hearing it we are reading it declaring it people are united for this
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:38.480]   purpose but be careful
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.480]   because that is exactly what the Jews were doing
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.480]   because they thought
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.480]   that if their king came that he was going to fix
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.480]   the government he was going to fix the economy he was going to
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.480]   fix their family he was going to fix their future he was going to fix
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:02.480]   their standing he was going to fix their temple yet
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.480]   in the midst of all of that they completely missed him
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:10.480]   Jesus says in John 14 27 peace I leave with you
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:14.480]   my peace I give to you not as the world gives do I give to you
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:18.480]   do not let your heart be troubled nor let it be fearful
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:22.480]   you cannot have the peace of God without
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:26.480]   the peace with God so this week
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.480]   is to get us to be recalibrated
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:34.480]   recalibrate our hearts because our natural tendency my bet is
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:40.480]   there is not a single person in here who doesn't have some sort of turmoil in your heart
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.480]   there is not a single person in here that doesn't have something to grieve over there is not a single
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.480]   person in here that doesn't have something to pray desperately over
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:52.480]   whether we are actually doing that or not
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:56.480]   but where do you find this peace do you believe
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:00.480]   that Jesus is our peace do you believe that Jesus
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.480]   is the prince of peace so we pray that this week
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:08.480]   as we go over the details of what happened every day
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.480]   that we don't look to man for answers we don't look to government for answers we don't look to organizations
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.480]   for answers we don't hold hands and say you know we're going to finally get the justice that we deserve
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:20.480]   because the only person
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:24.480]   who can actually declare desire or demand justice
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:28.480]   is Jesus Christ a sinner who
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.480]   demands justice is demanding punishment
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.480]   it is not justice that you and I desire it is mercy
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:40.480]   and that's exactly what Jesus came to do to give us mercy
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.480]   I'm going to ask the praise team to come up
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.480]   and I want to read a portion of this hymn that you guys
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.480]   all know very well it is well with my soul
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.480]   you know the story behind Horatio Spafford who was a
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:00.480]   famous and very successful attorney who made a lot of money
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:04.480]   and he turned that money into more money by purchasing all this property so he became a very
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:08.480]   wealthy man but there was a huge fire that broke out in Chicago and he lost
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.480]   everything overnight being distraught he sent his family
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.480]   his four girls and his wife over to England so that possibly he could start over
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.480]   over there but on this journey the ship
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:24.480]   has a shipwreck and all four of his girls died
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:28.480]   and only his wife survived she ends up going to England
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.480]   and sends him a wire saying all is lost
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.480]   all four of our children are gone in his
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.480]   bereavement he gets on a boat to go join his wife to comfort her
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:44.480]   and on his journey riding the boat they were crossing
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.480]   exactly the same place where his daughters died and on the
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:52.480]   intercom the captain of the boat said this is where that other
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.480]   boat sank and as he was looking upon the waters he wrote
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:00.480]   this hymn and in this hymn he says when peace like
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.480]   a river attendeth my way when sorrows like sea
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.480]   billows roll whatever my lot thou hast taught me to say
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.480]   it is well with my soul it is well with my soul
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:16.480]   though Satan should buffet though trials
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.480]   should come let this best assurance control
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.480]   that Christ has regarded my helpless estate and has shed his own blood
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.480]   for my soul it is well with my soul it is well
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.480]   my sin oh the bliss of this glorious
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:36.480]   thought my sin not in part but the whole
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:40.480]   is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more praise the Lord praise the Lord
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.480]   oh my soul it is well it is well with my soul it is well
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:48.480]   how can a human being write this
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:52.480]   in the situation that he was in
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:56.480]   watching over the very waters where his four
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:00.480]   beloved daughters drowned
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:04.480]   to say it is well with my soul it is well
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:08.480]   with my soul only a man
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.480]   who has found peace in Christ can write these words
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:16.480]   these aren't words that a natural man can
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.480]   write in a situation that he is in it is well
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:24.480]   with my soul it is well what makes
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:28.480]   you well what do you think is going to make you well
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:32.480]   what are you pursuing because you want peace
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:36.480]   I pray that each one of us would take this week
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:40.480]   deliberately to walk through the steps as he goes to the cross
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:44.480]   and recognize that this is why he came
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:48.480]   so why don't we all stand up together we're going to sing this song together
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:18:02.480]   [Music]
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:09.480]   When peace like a river
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:16.480]   Water hanketh my way
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:25.480]   When sorrows like sea billows roll
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:34.480]   Whatever my lot
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:40.480]   Thou hast taught me to say
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:53.480]   It is well, it is well with my soul
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:59.480]   It is well
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:05.480]   With my soul
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:19.480]   It is well, it is well with my soul
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:25.480]   Though Satan should buffet
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:31.480]   Though trial should come
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:45.480]   Let this blest assurance unfold
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:51.480]   That Christ has regarded
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:57.480]   My helpless estate
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:10.480]   And has shed his own blood for my soul
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:16.480]   It is well
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:23.480]   With my soul
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:34.480]   It is well, it is well with my soul
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:49.480]   My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:21:02.480]   My sin not in part but the whole
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:07.480]   Is nailed to the cross
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:14.480]   And I beg no more
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:20.480]   Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:28.480]   Oh my soul, say Lord haste the day
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:35.480]   When the figs shall be sown
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:47.480]   The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:54.480]   The floods shall be towns
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:59.480]   The floods shall be towns
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:05.480]   And the Lord shall descend
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:08.480]   In my soul
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.480]   It is well
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:18.480]   With my soul
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:24.480]   It is well
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:31.480]   With my soul
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:34.480]   It is well
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:44.480]   It is well with my soul
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:51.480]   Heavenly Father, you know where we're at.
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.480]   You know our tendency to drift.
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:57.480]   You know the temptations, Lord God, that we are struggling with.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:01.480]   You know, Father God, what we are entangled in.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:06.480]   Help us, Lord, especially this week, to be anchored in Christ.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:10.480]   Help us, Lord, to be determined to follow you and you alone.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:14.480]   Help us, Lord, as a church, to recognize, Lord,
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:17.480]   that our life is like a mist that comes and goes,
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:22.480]   that we would not invest, Lord God, in short-term goals, but for eternity.
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:26.480]   Help us to see the darkness around us and not to be in despair,
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:29.480]   but to recognize the work that you have placed us in
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:33.480]   so that we may be the light, and the darker that it gets,
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:37.480]   that we would see a greater need, Lord God, for the gospel.
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.480]   So we pray that you would awaken us, open our eyes, soften our hearts.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:46.480]   Help us to see your great, deliberate love that you've poured upon us,
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:52.480]   that Christ would be established, loved, adored, and worshipped, and obeyed.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:55.480]   Use this week, Lord God, for this purpose.
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.480]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:03.480]   God sent his Son
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:08.480]   They called him Jesus
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:13.480]   He came to love
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:18.480]   Healed and forgave
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:24.480]   He lived and died
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:29.480]   To buy my poverty
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:34.480]   An empty grave is there to
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:39.480]   My Savior live
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:45.480]   Because he lives
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:50.480]   I can face tomorrow
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:55.480]   Because he lives
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:25:01.480]   All fear is gone
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:06.480]   Because I know
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.480]   He holds the future
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:16.480]   And life is worth the living
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:21.480]   Just because he lives
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:27.480]   Just because he lives
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:32.480]   Just because he lives
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:37.480]   Just because he lives
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:42.480]   Just because he lives
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:47.480]   Just because he lives
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:52.480]   Just because he lives
