[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:48.020]   And on each day, we've asked just a brother or sister
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.380]   to come and share their testimony,
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.220]   how it is that they came to faith,
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.900]   and how has Christ changed them.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.860]   And also included in that is what they've been learning
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:05.860]   just thus far, just in their walk with the Lord.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.780]   And tonight, before we actually go through the events,
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.900]   we do have a testimony that our brother Alex Lee
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.260]   is going to be giving.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.000]   He is a dear brother.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.640]   He's in the young adult group, has been at Berean,
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.280]   just kinda came right in the middle of COVID,
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.500]   and just really has taken it upon himself
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.500]   to be a blessing just to many of our brothers in the BAM.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.700]   So he's gonna be sharing his testimony,
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.380]   but let me pray for us, and then he'll come up,
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.940]   and then as soon as he finishes,
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.500]   we'll proceed with all the events of Monday.
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.500]   Okay, let me pray for us.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.060]   Father, thank you for just gathering
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:54.340]   just your body on this evening to reflect,
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.820]   and that each and every day our hearts would
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.860]   just be softened, that we would be sober,
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:05.860]   that we would be both reflective and grateful,
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.020]   God, for all the events of this week.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.480]   We pray that as we hear from our brothers and sisters,
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.300]   as we read your word, as we sing,
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:19.140]   God, that our hearts would really be just ignited
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:23.540]   to worship, to long to know you, to make you known,
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.180]   and really to walk in the power of the spirit.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:31.340]   So we pray for you to move and to speak
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.940]   over the course of this week, that you would be honored,
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.300]   and as you are being honored,
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.380]   that, Lord, your church would be strengthened
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.620]   and beautified even more so.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.500]   And so we pray that tonight,
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.780]   as we offer this time up to you,
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.740]   that you administer in and through it.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.460]   We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.300]   Let's just warmly welcome up our brother,
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.140]   Alex Lee.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.300]   (audience applauding)
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:03.060]   - Hi, Berean.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.020]   My name is Alex Lee, and I thank you
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.120]   for this opportunity to share my testimony.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.940]   My story begins in the South Bay of Los Angeles,
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.580]   where I was raised and what appeared on the exterior
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.780]   to be a picturesque and harmonious home.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.980]   A loving family of five, marked by a father
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.540]   who ran a successful chiropractic clinic,
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.380]   and a mother who managed the daily affairs
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.100]   of the children and of the home.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.020]   A core set of memories of my upbringing
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.540]   involves my parents,
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.440]   who routinely host lavish parties and events,
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.640]   inviting many family members, friends, and acquaintances,
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.780]   some of whom they didn't even really like,
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.380]   as a means to parade their wealth
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.860]   and garner the awe, recognition,
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.600]   and even jealousy of those who attended.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.740]   In reflection, it is clear that one of the primary impulses
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.420]   that drove much of my parents' decision-making
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.100]   was a desire to erect what was a forged image
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.600]   of a perfect family,
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.820]   one that God and His providence
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.080]   would painfully yet graciously destroy.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.580]   A major component of this family image
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.100]   was the commitment to operate
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.560]   as a faithful Christian household.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.020]   But the religious adherence
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.420]   of faithfully attending Sunday service
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.660]   was detached from the glaring reality
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.200]   that Christ did not actually serve
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.220]   as the anchor of our home.
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.980]   A growing disconnect between our profession of faith
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.740]   and the obedience produced by such faith
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.780]   began to slowly chip away at the facade,
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.640]   and it was at the defining moment
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.060]   where I vividly remember waking up
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.500]   next to my brother and sister,
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.700]   our mom having carried our bodies from our beds into the car
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.940]   while we were asleep,
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.100]   and having driven around the city in search of our father,
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.900]   only to discover him gambling with friends
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.580]   in the wee hours of the morning,
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.140]   that I began to tangibly behold
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.580]   the brokenness in our family.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.940]   This brokenness continued to manifest
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.420]   in intense and agonizing ways,
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.220]   reaching its apex with the divorce of my parents,
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.460]   fueled by my father's drug and gambling habits,
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.100]   and a devastating act of adultery
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.100]   for which our family is still feeling
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.860]   the reverberations of to this day.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.680]   My mom made a desperate effort
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.640]   to preserve the scraps of what was left of our family,
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.580]   moving my siblings and me to Orange County
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.980]   with little to no money,
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.600]   hoping to start afresh and flee
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.300]   from a sinful and broken past.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.820]   But these efforts were in vain.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.080]   Sin and its devastating consequences
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.120]   would continue to be a reoccurring fixture in our home,
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.060]   and the havoc that ensued for many years afterwards
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.620]   drove each family member to pursue the idols and lusts
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.640]   that captivated each of our own hearts.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.060]   Though I was not at all academically driven
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.160]   prior to my parents' separation,
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.340]   this all dramatically changed post-divorce
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.740]   when our family moved to Orange County.
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:43.260]   Desperate to build my identity on academic success,
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.760]   perfect grades and accolades
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.060]   became my sole obsession
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.140]   throughout middle school and high school.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.580]   And at the expense of playing with a few friends that I had,
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.060]   I would often needlessly spend an extra hour or two
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.160]   studying for an exam.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:58.060]   While the decision to attend college on the East Coast
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.740]   was partially driven by my desire
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.340]   to escape the toxic captivity of our home,
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.760]   it was also largely motivated by a desire
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.260]   to further indulge in my obsession
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.160]   with grades and academic success.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.580]   Throughout my time in college,
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.620]   I would often spend six to seven days a week in the library
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.440]   from morning to past midnight,
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.700]   feverishly working on papers and studying for exams.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.960]   Whatever semblance of Christianity that was a part of my life
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.160]   had all but evaporated during those years.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.040]   As I approached graduation,
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.580]   I grew in greater anticipation
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.900]   as my academic goals were soon to be fully realized.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.600]   And the security of obtaining a job on Wall Street
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.280]   in New York City only strengthened the conviction
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.360]   that my worldly pursuits
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.920]   that truly enslaved me were justified.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.000]   That it was also precisely at this moment
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.200]   that the pitiful awareness that I would soon graduate
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.520]   with no friends to laugh, celebrate,
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.760]   and build lifelong relationships with
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.280]   that left a deep, nauseating knot in my stomach.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.000]   Yes, this sobering realization that graduation day for me
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.460]   would be marked by a sheer, uncomfortable loneliness
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.520]   drove me to make a decision that characterized
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.320]   much of the same decision-making patterns
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.800]   that defined my family's past.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.720]   So a few days before graduation,
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.480]   I packed my bags, left for home,
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.560]   and attempted to look forward
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.160]   to this new chapter in my life in New York.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.880]   Meanwhile, trying my best to suppress
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.520]   the deep ache in my heart that told me
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.720]   that all was not well.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.320]   This ache only intensified when I returned home,
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.300]   and it created a profound emptiness inside of me
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.320]   that could not be quelled by exam prep
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.000]   or completing problem sets.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.520]   What was there to study or complete?
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.360]   I graduated.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.120]   But it was at this moment God moved,
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.920]   and his spirit began the active and decisive process
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.760]   of drawing me to himself.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.520]   It was the summer after graduation
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.080]   when my heart was so far away from God
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.440]   that he miraculously and divinely made me stumble
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.120]   upon a four-minute sermon excerpt
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.160]   on what it means to believe.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.960]   I had never heard a gospel message
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.800]   communicated in such a way
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.680]   that so poignantly pierced my soul,
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.520]   and yet so sweetly filled the void in my heart
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.600]   that I could not displace.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.400]   Yes, it was at this exact moment
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.480]   that God literally broke me,
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.920]   bound my heart to him,
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.000]   and revealed to me how desperate I was in need of a son,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.180]   a savior for my soul.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.160]   I so vividly remember falling on my knees,
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.040]   crying out to God in tears,
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.760]   and pleading for the forgiveness of my sins
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.560]   through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.460]   I had my personal Damascus Row moment
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.200]   that could only be attributed to God
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.100]   and his immeasurable mercy on my life.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.880]   I left for New York City as a baby Christian,
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.080]   but one transformed by the relentless pursuit
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.880]   of a shepherd who knows and calls his own sheep.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.280]   And while I no doubt experienced
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.160]   my ample share of challenges living in the Big Apple,
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.320]   God would repeatedly draw me back to himself
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.920]   over and over and over again.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.960]   He would not let me go.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.040]   When I understood that saving faith
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.240]   is a coming, a receiving, an eating, a drinking,
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.280]   a resting, an enjoying,
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.960]   and being satisfied with all that God is for me in Jesus,
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.280]   the good fight of faith for me
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.800]   ultimately became a fight for joy,
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.400]   a fight for joy in Christ
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.280]   and not in the broken cisterns of this world
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.920]   that can hold no water,
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.160]   a fight that requires a daily putting to death
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.480]   what is earthly in me
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.240]   and dying every day to the things
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.060]   that will destroy this joy.
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.200]   It's about the reordering of life's priorities
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.400]   so that I'm no longer seeking a momentary joy in this life,
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.100]   but a forever joy in the next.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.560]   It's about discarding the old passions, dreams, goals,
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.080]   and desires that once dictated
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.200]   my superficial and fleeting happiness
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.000]   and instead opting for a more superior joy,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.500]   a joy that is complete and lasts forever.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.260]   Simply, it's doing whatever I must
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.900]   to see Jesus for who he gloriously is
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.060]   and enjoying him above all other things.
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:45.980]   In retrospect, it has become clear and clear to me
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.440]   that God has wasted nothing in my life.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.780]   In his eternal wisdom and divine providence,
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.340]   he uses the painful moments of my past
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.900]   and the scars that I bear today
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.260]   to mold me into a greater likeness of his son
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.860]   for my ultimate good and for his infinite glory.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.660]   I leave you with one of my favorite verses
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.100]   from Psalm 73, verses 25 through 26.
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.580]   Whom have I in heaven but you,
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.340]   and there's nothing on earth that I desire besides you.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.500]   My flesh and my heart may fail,
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.880]   but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.860]   It is my earnest prayer
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.480]   that I can sing these precious words
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.980]   with a sincere and joyful heart for all of eternity.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.100]   And it too is my hope that this truth
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.500]   would forever ring true for our church as well,
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.520]   that God and Christ would be our portion forever.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.360]   Thank you.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.780]   (audience applauds)
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:43.800]   - All right, thank you, Alex.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:49.360]   You guys all know this, but the Passion Week
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.640]   is undoubtedly the most important week
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.560]   in all of human history.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.960]   And it's a week that
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.840]   really defines God's relationship with mankind.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.440]   It's also the loneliest week in all of human history
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.440]   where Jesus suffers physically,
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.200]   he suffers socially, he suffers emotionally,
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.640]   but more importantly, more than anything else,
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.520]   he suffers the agonizing separation from his father
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.420]   with whom he had enjoyed perfect union.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:30.040]   But on the cross, he was permanently separated.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.120]   In fact, he was hated by the father whom he loved.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.120]   And so this is a very difficult week
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.380]   to think through, to process through,
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.720]   but nonetheless, it's very important.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.920]   And something that you might not have noticed before,
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.780]   but I put it up on a little chart.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:56.880]   This is such an important week
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.880]   that there is a lot in the gospel accounts of this week.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:07.440]   In fact, almost half of the book of John
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:11.200]   is about this week, or it records things
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.960]   that Jesus taught during this week.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.680]   Mark, it's about 41%.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:22.760]   Luke's focus, though it is a little bit different,
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:27.400]   it still contains 27% of all the material
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.120]   is about the Passion Week.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.560]   And Matthew, about 35%.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.120]   So if you just look at the number,
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:38.120]   like the amount of ink that's devoted to the Passion Week,
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.600]   it's pretty significant.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.200]   So if you're reading through the Bible
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.820]   over the course of the year,
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.880]   if you're going through the gospel accounts,
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.380]   just be mindful that almost half of the time
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.800]   you're gonna be looking at this one week, okay?
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.960]   And so today, I wanted to look at the events of Monday,
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.040]   and I'm gonna be starting with just reading through
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:06.440]   Mark's account because it does give us a lot of good detail.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.560]   And then we're gonna be looking at
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:14.560]   just some of the specifics in there,
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.980]   and I'll walk you through those things, okay?
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.380]   But yesterday was Palm Sunday,
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.840]   so I wanna start with a little bit of,
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.260]   just as a refresher of the events that took place yesterday.
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.560]   Mark 11, nine to 14 reads,
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.480]   "Those who went in front and those who followed
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.780]   "were shouting, 'Hosanna!
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.800]   "'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.120]   "'Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father, David.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.900]   "'Hosanna in the highest!'
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:48.060]   "And Jesus entered Jerusalem, came into the temple,
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.520]   "and after looking around at everything,
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.920]   "he left for Bethany with the twelve,
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.400]   "since it was already late."
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.560]   So this is Palm Sunday, right?
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.560]   And then we pick up on Monday.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:05.720]   On the next day, when they had left Bethany,
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:09.200]   he became hungry, and I wanna pause there.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.240]   Bethany serves as the home base.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.040]   Presumably, we're at the home of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.240]   for the duration of the book of this week.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.060]   And it's about a two-mile walk to and from.
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:27.600]   So on each of the days, Jesus goes from Bethany
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.400]   to Jerusalem, where the temple is,
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.200]   and back and forth, back and forth.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:36.860]   On a couple of occasions, he stops to teach.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.760]   But the road from Bethany to Jerusalem
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.360]   is primarily the road that is walked
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.280]   on the first few days of the Passion Week.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.040]   So on the next day, when they had left Bethany,
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.760]   he became hungry.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.760]   Verse 13, "Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf,
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.440]   "he went to see if perhaps he would find anything on it.
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.980]   "And when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves,
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.460]   "for it was not the season for figs.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.080]   "And he said to it,
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.560]   "May no one ever eat fruit from you again."
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.260]   And his disciples were listening,
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.040]   probably a little bit perplexed.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.440]   Felt like, kind of mean.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.440]   He's just cursing a tree.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.340]   Okay, but it continues in verse 15.
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.040]   "Then they came to Jerusalem."
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.660]   And remember, it's about a two-mile walk.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.580]   "And he entered the temple, and he began to drive out
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:35.780]   "those who were buying and selling in the temple,
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.320]   "and overturned the tables of the money changers
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.040]   "and the seats of those who were selling doves.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.660]   "And he would not permit anyone to carry merchandise
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.120]   "through the temple.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:51.040]   "And he began to teach and say to them,
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.480]   "'Is it not written, my house shall be called
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.100]   "'a house of prayer for all the nations,
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.760]   "'but you have made it a robber's den.'"
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.840]   All three, Matthew, Mark, and Luke,
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.840]   all three synoptics have this in their accounts.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.760]   This teaching of having turned the house of God
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.320]   into a den of thieves, a den of robbers.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.240]   And I'm gonna be walking with you briefly
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:23.920]   of why that's so familiar and why that's so significant.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.060]   Okay, so this is in all three accounts.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:31.040]   The chief priests and the scribes respond to this.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.680]   They hear this.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:36.480]   They know that he's talking about them
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.200]   and seeking now how to destroy him,
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.380]   for they were afraid of him,
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.480]   for the whole crowd was astonished at his teaching.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:50.260]   And then evening came, they would go out of the city,
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.080]   and it doesn't say this here in Mark's account,
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.980]   but they returned to Bethany.
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:59.360]   "This section, my house shall be called
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.000]   "a house of prayer for all the nations,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.860]   "but you have made it a robber's den."
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:08.620]   It comes from both Isaiah and it comes in Jeremiah
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.940]   at one of the darkest periods in all of Israel's history,
[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:17.260]   the time period when the people of God are described
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.340]   as everybody is greedy for gain
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.540]   in Jeremiah three and Jeremiah 15.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.460]   The priests are bribeable.
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.800]   The prophets prophesy out of their own delusion.
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:34.020]   The governors govern by their own authority,
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.660]   and all of them say, "Thus saith the Lord,"
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:41.500]   and they almost pronounce a peace and prosperity
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.780]   upon all the people of God
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:49.040]   without really knowing the heart of God,
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.540]   and Jeremiah's ministry on the surface is very unfruitful.
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.020]   No one pays attention to him.
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.420]   In fact, he is persecuted, he is imprisoned,
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:03.420]   he is mistreated, he is neglected, he is the crazy fool,
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.780]   and that's the context.
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:09.220]   And I wanna show you a section out of Jeremiah seven
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.780]   from where this is found.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:15.500]   Jeremiah seven one, "The word that came to Jeremiah
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.660]   "from the Lord saying, 'Stand in the gate
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.200]   "'of the Lord's house and proclaim there this word
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.440]   "'and say, 'Hear the word of the Lord, all of you Judah,
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.720]   "'who enter by the gates to worship the Lord.'"
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:34.640]   So Jeremiah is being given a command to worshipers of God,
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.760]   and in this period, there aren't many,
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.440]   but they're called those who go to worship the Lord.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.960]   Verse three, "Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.040]   "amend your ways and your deeds,
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.580]   "and I will let you dwell in this place.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.740]   "Do not trust in deceptive words saying,
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.940]   "'This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord,
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.560]   "'the temple of the Lord.'
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.220]   "For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds,
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.440]   "if you truly practice justice between a man
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.220]   "and his neighbor, if you do not oppress the alien,
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.320]   "the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.160]   "in this place, nor walk after other gods to your own ruin,"
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:20.160]   and those are all evidences of a life that is lived
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.320]   abiding in the spirit of Yahweh.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.640]   Okay, so these aren't things that you do to gain his favor,
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.400]   these are characteristics of people
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.200]   who genuinely worship the Lord.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:36.360]   Then, verse seven, "I will let you dwell in this place,
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:40.160]   "in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:46.340]   "But behold, you are trusting in deceptive words
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.960]   "to no avail.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:55.920]   "Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely,
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:01.060]   "and then offer sacrifices to Baal and walk after other gods
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:05.060]   "that you have not known, and then come and stand before me
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:09.660]   "in this house, which is called by my name,
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.980]   "and say, 'We are delivered,'
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:16.980]   "and that you may do all these abominations?
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:21.160]   "Has this house, which is called by my name,
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.640]   "become a den of robbers in your sight?
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:28.980]   "Behold, I, even I, have seen it, declares the Lord.
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.040]   "But go now to my place, which was in Shiloh,
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.540]   "where I made my name dwell at the first,
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.380]   "and see what I did to it because of all the wickedness
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.680]   "of my people Israel.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.480]   "And now, because you have done all these things,
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.220]   "declares the Lord, and I spoke to you,
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.180]   "rising up early and speaking, but you did not hear.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.680]   "I called you, but you did not answer.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.000]   "Therefore, I will do to this house,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.360]   "which is called by my name, in which you trust,
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.480]   "and to the place which I gave you and your forefathers,
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.440]   "as I did to Shiloh.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.360]   "I will cast you out of my sight,
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.380]   "as I have cast out all your brothers,
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.860]   "all the offspring of Ephraim."
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.600]   And then he says to Jeremiah, "As for you,
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.460]   "don't pray for this people.
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.240]   "Do not lift up a cry or prayer for them.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.420]   "Do not intercede with me.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.020]   "I am not hearing you."
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:24.300]   So the Lord has given his people over.
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:31.820]   And the temple is soon gonna be destroyed in 586.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.980]   All of the goods that are in the temple of God
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.820]   are gonna be carried away to Babylon.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:41.080]   And Jesus is quoting this famous section of Jeremiah
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.120]   to say that this is gonna happen again.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:49.440]   In Matthew chapter 23, no stone is gonna be overturned.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.580]   And Pastor Peter mentioned that yesterday in a sermon.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:57.300]   You leaders of Israel,
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:03.420]   you scribes, you Pharisees, hypocrites,
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:08.400]   you who clean the outside of the cup and of the dish,
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:13.400]   but inwardly are full of robbery and self-indulgence.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.760]   It says in Matthew chapter 23,
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:22.000]   all of this is gonna be done.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.040]   So there's a judgment that is declared.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:30.640]   So Jesus enters into the temple on this Monday,
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.520]   and he does not mince words.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.280]   (coughing)
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.540]   Things are gonna go down.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:46.280]   Matthew's account, I wanna read that briefly
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.600]   so that it gives you a little bit more insight
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.300]   into what happens during that day.
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.840]   And Jesus entered the temple,
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.900]   drove out all those who were buying and selling
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.000]   in the temple, overturned the tables of the money changers
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.320]   and the seats of those who were selling doves.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.460]   And he said to them, "It is written,
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.000]   "my house shall be called a house of prayer,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.260]   "but you are making it a robber's den."
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.800]   And this is the only place of the three synoptics
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.680]   where this is mentioned,
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.500]   but the blind and the lame came to him in the temple,
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.400]   and he healed them.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:23.600]   So he's performing miracles even on this day.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:27.220]   But when the chief priests and the scribes,
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.720]   they just got lambasted.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.160]   They just got like a scathing rebuke from Jesus.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.200]   And then when the chief priests and the scribes
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.960]   saw these wonderful things that he had done,
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.600]   and then from the day before,
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.040]   the children who were shouting in the temple,
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.880]   "Hosanna to the son of David,"
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.620]   oh, they became indignant.
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:52.200]   So we're gonna see a growing hatred toward Jesus
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:58.320]   who hatefully spoke out against them,
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.760]   and it's gonna start building momentum
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.840]   into Tuesday and Wednesday,
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.100]   and then you know the events on Thursday, Friday, and Easter.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:14.360]   So there is a clear standoff now
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:18.960]   between religiosity and the heart of God.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.920]   So this is what happens on Monday.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:26.360]   There is a cursing of the fig tree
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.000]   on the way from Bethany to Jerusalem,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.160]   and there's an explanation of it on Tuesday.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.740]   Okay, so I'll leave that for,
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.880]   I believe it's Pastor Nate tomorrow.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.560]   And there's a clearing out of the temple.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:47.560]   There are miracles and confrontations in the same temple.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:52.560]   And then after this exhausting, probably tense,
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:57.640]   and very just not pleasant day in Jerusalem,
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:03.160]   they return to Bethany,
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.740]   and those are the things that happen on Monday.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.100]   So Monday is not that positive of a day,
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:15.140]   but Jesus, it seems, draws a line,
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.080]   and that's the events of Monday.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.000]   So my encouragement over the course of tomorrow
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.080]   is to just start your day.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:30.480]   The passages will be up via Instagram, on Facebook,
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.960]   just the events on Tuesday,
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.720]   and Pastor Nate will explain
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.080]   and just walk us through the events.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.920]   Okay, let me pray for us.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:46.360]   Father, we're very thankful,
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:52.400]   first and foremost, God, that you provide for us your word,
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:58.280]   and that in your word, we learn so much about your character,
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.800]   about who you are.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:04.280]   And in your word, we also see so much of who we aren't.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.480]   And we're thankful, God, that you
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.960]   are a God of great compassion and love,
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.920]   and you are a promise-keeping God who keeps his covenant.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   And who pursues even the most unlovable of people.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:29.980]   We pray that as we reflect on each and every day's events,
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.920]   that you would give us a greater insight into your heart.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:39.480]   Lord, would you become more magnificent
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.020]   and holy in our sight?
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.800]   And as we reflect on our own hearts,
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.400]   that we would be so broken and disgusted
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.680]   by the sin and the residual effects
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.600]   of sin still that reside,
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.520]   so that we would understand and appreciate grace
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.520]   all the more.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:01.280]   We thank you, Lord, for our brother's testimony,
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.360]   and we know that there are many other awesome testimonies
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:08.440]   of your saving grace, your life-giving power.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.880]   So as we begin this week,
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.120]   just reflecting on each and every day's events,
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:17.700]   help us to be a growingly sober people,
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:22.500]   so that Good Friday truly would be good,
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.600]   not just in title only, but, Lord, in our hearts.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:29.360]   He became sin who knew no sin,
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.160]   so that we might become the righteousness of God.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:36.460]   Help us to be awed, be humbled,
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.960]   and be overwhelmed with gratitude at those truths.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.360]   We thank you, Lord, for tonight.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.880]   We pray for just sober hearts, prayerful spirits,
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.000]   and joy-filled walks.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.400]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:56.480]   - Y'all stand for our final song.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:03.720]   (gentle music)
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.300]   (gentle music)

[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:59.880]   - You may be seated.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.800]   We're gonna take about 10 minutes
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.760]   just to pray for each other.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.520]   And tonight, I would like us to just share
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.400]   and pray together over this one question.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:17.880]   In what areas of my Christian life
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.560]   and my involvement in church
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:24.760]   are more driven by conformity and religiosity
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:28.200]   than genuine heart of brokenness and worship to God?
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.680]   And so I want us to take some time
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.080]   just to confess and pray for each other.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.680]   Where am I prone to being just a performer?
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:40.600]   Where am I prone just to being a fake church participant?
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.000]   Where am I just man-centered
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.760]   in my participation in the life of the church?
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.440]   Because those are the things that
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:55.240]   God doesn't like just what's on the outside.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.600]   It's just a superficial performance
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.340]   is not something that he desires.
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.460]   So if you guys can take about 10 minutes
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:06.480]   to just share briefly, to confess, to pray together,
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.600]   and then in about 10 minutes, I'll come back up,
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.960]   and then I'll give some announcements,
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.840]   and then we'll do a closing prayer, okay?
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.680]   All right.

[01:03:40.140 --> 01:04:04.180]   - All right, take another 30 seconds at most
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:05.700]   to wrap up your prayers.
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.820]   (audience chattering)
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:30.220]   Before we just do a final time of prayer,
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.820]   I'm gonna give you guys a couple of announcements.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:37.300]   The shuttle will continue just to be running
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:40.740]   until nine o'clock, so if you feel the need
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.820]   to socialize and pray with people longer,
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:49.820]   you can maybe bring your car over and then park it,
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.780]   but the shuttle team, they will end the service
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:55.140]   at nine o'clock, so please be mindful of that.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.700]   Thursday, we do have some spots available,
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:01.500]   so if you wanted to sign up for the Passover Feast,
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.660]   you still can do so, but again, the priority
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:08.740]   is gonna be for members and first-time participants,
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.740]   but it is a formal event, so for you guys who are coming,
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.780]   not like super formal where you have to wear tux,
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.780]   but like something that you would wear
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:21.260]   just on a Sunday that isn't like,
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.140]   no, some of y'all dress bad on Sunday.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:30.620]   At least like a button, okay, and then like something
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:35.140]   that you would work in, okay, in the 90s, all right,
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:39.740]   so that's Thursday at 6.30.
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:42.240]   Now, here's an important announcement for Friday.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:47.820]   We're gonna have a very, very, very packed house on Friday,
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:51.380]   so a couple of requests on our end.
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.140]   Please don't come at 7.20.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:57.300]   If you can, by all means, help it, come before.
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.860]   Straggle in before.
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.860]   Grab a coffee, bring your dinner, and eat it here.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:05.020]   One, it'll help you come on time,
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:09.060]   and two, you're not gonna overwhelm the shuttle team,
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:12.260]   'cause a lot of our parking spots are a little farther away.
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:17.020]   The parking spot availabilities will be made known
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.460]   as we just progress over the course of the week
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:22.260]   via Instagram, Facebook, and then you'll have
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.860]   our brothers and sisters out there with me on stuff,
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:29.820]   like directing you, but they wanna participate as well,
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:34.060]   so if you guys all come early and you make them unnecessary
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:38.140]   at 7.15, that would be great, right?
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:41.420]   So please do show up on time, and for the welcoming ushers
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.060]   to help them, if you come on time,
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:47.620]   because a lot of our church body is not here tonight,
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.900]   but if you guys can all squeeze in the middle
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.700]   and come up toward the front, it would help
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:54.020]   just with the ushering, okay?
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:57.020]   So just expect Friday to be kinda busy,
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:00.740]   and there is communion, so please do prepare your hearts
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.860]   each and every day for it.
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.580]   We have plenty of help for the Saturday saucing
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.020]   and everything for the Sunday lunch,
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.740]   but we do need help putting all the lunches together,
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:12.900]   'cause we are putting food for about 800.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:17.460]   So just, if you can help by any means, sign up,
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:19.300]   and even if you don't sign up and you can lend a hand
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.060]   between, after second and service, third service,
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:24.420]   please do so, don't just grab and go.
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:27.220]   If you're able, please do help, okay?
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.860]   Also, I did see a weather forecast
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.340]   that Saturday and Sunday might rain,
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:36.580]   so just in case, just kinda keep an eye
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:40.100]   on all the announcements, so if we need to adjust,
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:44.380]   so that you can get a heads up on that, okay?
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:48.620]   Let me pray for us, and then we'll formally dismiss.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.620]   Father, thank you for just this evening.
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:53.540]   I pray that every evening would be just filled
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.540]   with a lot of prayer, a lot of praise,
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:58.700]   a lot of reflection, humility, brokenness,
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:01.740]   but more than anything else, just a growing confidence,
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:04.140]   Lord, in your kindness.
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:06.380]   It's your kindness that leads us to repentance.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.500]   It is your grace that causes us to be saved,
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.740]   and that we cannot boast in any way, shape, or form.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:16.700]   All this is from you and through you and for you,
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:20.460]   and so we pray that you would take the very center stage
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:24.420]   at our church every day for the whole course of this week.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.260]   We love you, Lord.
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:28.940]   We thank you, Lord, for just your provision of our church,
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:30.840]   and we pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
