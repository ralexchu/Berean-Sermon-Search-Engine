[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Very thankful, but you know, while I was in Taiwan,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   obviously the coronavirus was just starting to take off,
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.760]   and that was like the news feed, you know,
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.080]   every single minute that was out there,
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.780]   until we got the news of Kobe Bryant.
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.240]   Then all of a sudden it went silent,
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.520]   and everything was about Kobe Bryant.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.720]   And I remember waking up early in the morning,
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.200]   looking at the news, and I was like,
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.240]   what, this gotta be a joke, right?
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.920]   How can Kobe Bryant be gone?
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.080]   I thought it was one of those, you know,
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.680]   these YouTube things that was going on.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.800]   And then Zachary, my son, actually texted me,
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.960]   said, did you hear about this?
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.560]   And that's when I started seeing
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.300]   that it was really blown up everywhere.
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.560]   And even to my own, you know,
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.680]   like as I was examining myself,
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.400]   I was so sad to hear this news.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.680]   I mean, you know, I've lived long enough
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.180]   to live through many celebrities and athletes
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.800]   who've gone through tragic stuff and lost their lives,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.400]   and you know, even personally,
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.200]   but I don't know this guy, you know?
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.960]   He's just somebody that I watched for many years.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.400]   And I was deeply saddened,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.480]   and I was watching videos almost in tears.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.320]   But I was even surprised, you know,
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.280]   I was even surprised, like why I was getting so emotional
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.840]   over the death of Kobe Bryant, you know?
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.520]   And then I just started really thinking,
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.440]   and then, you know, like,
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.800]   I've been watching this guy since he was 17 years old,
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.640]   coming into this league as a cocky young kid,
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.360]   and this is when Michael Jordan was, you know,
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.120]   like Michael Jordan was Michael Jordan,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.400]   and he comes in and he's like challenging Michael Jordan.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.400]   This 17-year-old kid straight out of high school
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.520]   saying he's going to take Michael Jordan.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.440]   It was so cocky, and at that time,
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.480]   everybody had that opinion of him.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.080]   How can a 17-year-old punk kid
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.320]   come in here and challenge Michael Jordan?
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.040]   And that's why he didn't get a starting position.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.300]   Even though he came to Lakers,
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.480]   they didn't allow him to start
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.960]   because he was just too cocky, you know?
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.320]   He needed to humble himself.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.080]   He needed to earn his position.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.120]   But to our surprise, every year went by,
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.000]   he actually started to gain respect.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.920]   He started to actually get that good.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.640]   And to see this young guy throughout the years
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.400]   just growing and actually challenging Michael Jordan,
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.360]   and then he got to a point where
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.040]   there was actually a debate, who's better?
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.280]   You know, if you grew up watching Michael Jordan,
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.960]   that was, I never thought that anybody would come along
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.400]   where anybody would be even compared to Michael Jordan.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.240]   But at the peak of Kobe Bryant's career,
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.160]   people were actually starting to say that.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.680]   And to my surprise, it's like,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.000]   "Whoa, there's some games.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.880]   "He actually looks like he's right up there
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.800]   "with Michael Jordan."
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.500]   And I remember that game when he scored 81 points
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.640]   at Pastor Mark's birthday.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.280]   Some of you guys were there, right?
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.020]   We completely forgot why we were there.
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.800]   We were watching that game.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.880]   In the middle of the birthday party, we started watching.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.440]   And so a lot of the guys at the church,
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.280]   our church was small enough where all the guys
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.400]   were invited to his birthday party and we were celebrating,
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.520]   and we completely forgot, 'cause when he scored 81 points,
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.400]   oh my gosh, right?
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   And that's a memory that all the brothers here
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.360]   when the church was smaller that we remember.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.640]   And then when he won the championship in 2010,
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.160]   okay, so don't worry, this sermon is not about Kobe Bryant.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.680]   Okay, this is just the introduction, okay?
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.800]   When he won the championship in 2010,
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.320]   after they lost a heartbreaking loss to the Celtics
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.160]   in 2008 and came back, won the year after that,
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.760]   and then they came back and played Boston,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.440]   and they went all the way to the seventh game,
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.600]   and Kobe Bryant was at the middle of this.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.960]   And I remember watching this at home by myself
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.320]   with my kids when they were a bit younger.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.200]   And I was just so excited when Lakers won,
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.080]   and I was literally high-fiving myself.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.040]   I was banging the wall,
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.080]   'cause I had nobody to celebrate with.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.680]   This guy was at the center of so much joy in my life
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.440]   because Lakers was my team,
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.600]   and he was the superstar on that team for so long.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.800]   And so it was weird when he blew his Achilles,
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.120]   and seeing that interview, I just completely defeated.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.140]   A guy who was so cocky for so long,
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.000]   and then sitting there realizing that maybe this is the end,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.040]   and it was, again, a part of Kobe that I've never seen.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.680]   It was like, wow, this is really coming to an end.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.920]   And then at his retirement, the last game,
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.960]   he scored 60 points.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.600]   You guys remember that, too, right?
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.000]   And it was just, the way that he just went out,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.760]   it was like, wow, that guy, he scored 60 points,
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.640]   and then he went out in glory.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.000]   But then that's not where he ended.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.960]   He came, and obviously, he lives in Newport,
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.640]   so a lot of our people run into him here
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.880]   and run into him there throughout his journey
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.280]   through his basketball career.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.880]   And then seeing him really mature as a man,
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.280]   and he was not a perfect man.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.680]   Obviously, we know all of that,
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.960]   if we know all of his history.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.800]   And yet, afterwards, you could see him maturing
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.440]   as a father, as a husband, and he was dedicated.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.400]   When they would ask him, don't you miss basketball?
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.120]   And to be honest, I was curious what kind of person
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.560]   he was going to be after he retired.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.480]   Is he going to be like Jordan?
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.400]   Is he going to be like other superstars?
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.000]   He's kind of hanging around the NBA
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.320]   'cause they want to relive their glory.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.120]   But it just seems like he's actually moving on,
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.600]   and he's doing greater things,
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.120]   and really committed to his girls.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.920]   And then, right in the middle of that,
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.520]   when it seemed like he was just beginning to mature,
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.320]   for him to just tragically die like that in a helicopter,
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.800]   and it was really heart-wrenching for a while.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.120]   Even now, it's hard to watch the video of his life
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.520]   without getting emotional.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.000]   And I started thinking to myself,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.640]   and I think anybody who's a Lakers fan,
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.040]   especially if you're a little bit older,
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.040]   and you've seen the whole gamut,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.440]   some of you guys who are in your late 30s, early 40s,
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.080]   you actually lived it with him 'cause you were that age,
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.320]   you grew up.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.960]   Why is it so emotional?
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.320]   I can tell who are Lakers fans
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.880]   when we bring up the name Kobe.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.720]   I can already see it now, right?
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.920]   The Golden State Warrior fans,
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.360]   you have no idea what I'm talking about.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.800]   You say, what is he talking about?
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.640]   I don't get it.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.320]   The Lakers fans, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.520]   We talk about Kobe, and there's almost teary-eyed,
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.360]   you know, like man tears, right?
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.600]   Why is there such affection for him?
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.280]   What did he do for us?
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.000]   Did he ever show up at your door on your birthday
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.440]   with a gift, did he ever buy you,
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.040]   did he ever mention your name?
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.560]   He doesn't even know who we are.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.200]   Why is there this affection for him?
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.840]   Because for so many years, we've seen his glory,
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.280]   what he was good at for so long.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.280]   See, the reason why there's such an attachment
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.320]   to somebody like that, even from a distance,
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.920]   is because you and I have been created
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.600]   for the purpose of worship.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.480]   We feel the most alive when we are in the presence
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.320]   of something beyond us, and we begin to worship it.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.960]   See, Kobe was, in a good way, in a bad way,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.320]   an idol for many of us, somebody that was beyond.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.080]   You know, how many of us sitting in traffic
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.040]   fantasize about owning a helicopter
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.680]   and just hovering over the traffic
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.320]   and get to work in 15 minutes?
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.040]   You know, we fantasize about Kobe,
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.920]   like his life, what he's able to do.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.600]   To have that stripped away so suddenly,
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.080]   I mean, it's understandable that we have these emotions,
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.680]   because at the core of who we are,
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.960]   that's how God created us.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.320]   He created us to be worshipers,
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.480]   rather than the objects of worship.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.080]   See, when Adam and Eve challenged God's glory,
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.200]   instead of worshiping God, they said,
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.280]   "Well, maybe I can have this wisdom.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.960]   "Maybe I can touch this glory."
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.680]   And in their pursuit of their own glory,
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.240]   the fall of mankind happened.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.880]   And at the core of human rebellion,
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.840]   it is our desire to be recognized,
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.840]   rather than to recognize the one
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.680]   who is deserving of this glory.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.240]   That's why the Bible describes the fall of mankind
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.080]   as what, falling short of his glory.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.000]   And that's why when Jesus was going to the cross,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.680]   what did he say?
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.840]   It is time to glorify the Son,
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.800]   as the Son glorifies the Father.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.040]   He describes the act of redemption of mankind
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.600]   as glorifying the Father, glorifying the Son.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.800]   Because that was what was tainted,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.760]   that was what was lost at the fall.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.200]   The problem of mankind is we worship idols,
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.960]   and we worship ourselves,
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.280]   and we put ourselves where God ought to be,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.000]   and all through life, we struggle,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.640]   because that's not the way God intended.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.280]   What we do with, whether it is Kobe,
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.600]   or whether it's basketball, or some superstar,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.760]   or whatever else that takes the place
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.200]   where God and God alone ought to be,
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.360]   will eventually end in some sort of heartache.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.080]   Because it was never meant to be that way.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.320]   Whether we are at the center,
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.400]   or someone else is sitting in that seat,
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.920]   eventually we will begin to see
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.720]   when the Bible says that sin reigns.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.520]   See, it is this that God has been trying
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.040]   to restore to mankind.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.000]   That's the reason why you and I are here,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.320]   first and foremost.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.920]   Not to be better people.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.760]   Of course, we all want to be better people.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.760]   Not to simply be more moral.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.400]   Not to be better churchgoers.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.360]   But in the end, to restore that glory
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.520]   that was lost at the fall.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.320]   And that's why when this question is asked of Jesus,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.720]   teacher, which is the greatest commandment of the law?
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.600]   And he said to him, you shall love the Lord your God
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.560]   with all your heart, with all your soul,
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.960]   with all your mind.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.600]   This is the greatest commandment.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.480]   He says this because this is what went wrong with mankind.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.480]   That affection that we felt,
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.040]   that sorrow that we felt,
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   over somebody that we didn't even know,
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.520]   simply because he was displaying his gifts.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.480]   And we were wowed, and we experienced so much life and joy
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.720]   because of what he was able to do.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:16.040]   God restores that, and he displays his glory in the cross,
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.560]   and he tells us to come to him
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.920]   because true life is found in Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.080]   If we find such life in watching
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.200]   a trivial basketball player live out his life,
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.920]   how much more will life be restored
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.560]   when we are restored in seeing his glory?
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.280]   That's why the Bible describes us
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.000]   as people who have opened our eyes
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.940]   to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.280]   That's the difference between a Christian
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.120]   and a non-Christian.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.320]   That's why Jonathan Edwards describes a Christian
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.840]   who has affection for Christ.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.040]   How do you know if you're a Christian or not?
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.560]   He said the number one quality of a Christian
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.520]   is he opened his eyes to see the glory
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.760]   that he was not able to see when he was in his sin.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.640]   So when Christ came and cleansed us from our sins,
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.880]   our eyes became open,
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.000]   and we saw the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.320]   and that's when we find new life.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.640]   And new life isn't just not dying and not going to hell.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.440]   New life is new today.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.380]   What makes me happy, what brings joy,
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.480]   what causes me to feel alive has changed.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.820]   Because now we see that my greatest joy is found
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.200]   in the glory of Christ Jesus.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.340]   That's the distinguishing mark
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.820]   between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.260]   A non-Christian can pretend.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.380]   He can go through the motion.
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.220]   He can go to church.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.420]   He can give.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.240]   He can even evangelize.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.100]   But a distinguishing mark between somebody
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.140]   who saw the glory and who didn't see the glory
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.460]   is the affection that is created when we see that.
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.340]   That's what he means when he says
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.060]   the greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.900]   with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.060]   Because that's why he died.
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.020]   That's why he was resurrected.
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.680]   And that's what he desires.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.980]   You know, this passage alone, stands alone.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.060]   I don't need to even talk about the context
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.420]   'cause we know this passage so well.
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.100]   But understanding the context will bring even more light
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.300]   to why and what he is saying in this text.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.980]   This is not actually the first question.
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.660]   The question that this scribe asked Jesus,
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.620]   it was actually third of three questions that was asked.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.660]   The first question is asked by the Pharisees
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.520]   and the Herodians in chapter 22, 15 to 22.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.100]   So before I even get to that,
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.620]   we have to understand that these questions
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.740]   are coming during Jesus' last week in his life.
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.460]   And so he turns over the tables, he cleanses the temple,
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.940]   and he knows that he's headed toward the cross
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.980]   and is in this context that the Pharisees
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.660]   and the Herodians want to trap him,
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.220]   want to get him to say something
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.020]   so that they can take him to court and say,
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:02.880]   he is blaspheming or he is inciting insurrection
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.340]   against the Roman government
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.740]   so that they would have a reason to crucify him.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.860]   It is in that context where it says in verse 15,
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.140]   the Pharisees went and plotted together
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.340]   how they might trap him in what he said.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.620]   Now remember that.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.140]   This was not an innocent question,
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.900]   that they just wanted to know the answer.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.060]   They were putting him in a trap.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.340]   And he says, verse 16, they sent their disciples to him
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.100]   along with the Herodians.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.620]   Now you have to understand,
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.620]   the Pharisees and the Herodians were mortal enemies.
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:39.480]   Herodians were the ones who sided with the Roman government.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.580]   They were the ones who went around collecting taxes
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.380]   and they handed it over to the Roman government.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.540]   The Pharisees resented that
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.900]   because if we pay these taxes,
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.580]   they're going to use that to suppress us
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.700]   with their paganism.
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.020]   And so Rome actually set up a statue of Caesar.
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.220]   Every time they went to the temple,
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.780]   they had to bow and acknowledge
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.180]   that Caesar is greater than any God that you worship.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.140]   And the Herodians were the agents who were carrying this out.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.820]   So the fact that the Pharisees and the Herodians
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.520]   together went to Jesus,
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.460]   you could see the hatred behind what they were saying.
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.420]   Because if he answers this question,
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.980]   verse 16, we know that you are truthful
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.580]   and teach the way of God in truth
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.100]   and defer to no one for you are not partial to any.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.260]   Think about the sarcasm behind that.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.500]   Already knowing what their intent is.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.980]   Tell us then, what do you think?
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.500]   Is it lawful to give poll tax to Caesar or not?
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.300]   But Jesus perceived their malice and said,
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.300]   why are you testing me, you hypocrites?
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.980]   See, if Jesus answers this wrong and he says,
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.460]   you know what, just pay the taxes,
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.860]   then the Pharisees would incite their disciples against.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.940]   See, he's blaspheming.
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.700]   This money is going to go to force us to worship other gods.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.420]   See, how could he be your Messiah?
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.020]   Or if he said, don't pay the taxes,
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.340]   the Herodians would report that to the Romans and say,
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.660]   you see, he's telling people to disrespect the Romans.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.540]   And he's rejecting your authority.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.340]   He's going to incite a rebellion
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.420]   against the Roman government.
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.140]   And no matter how he answered it,
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.780]   one side would have reason to crucify him.
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.500]   And that was a trap that they were setting to Jesus.
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.700]   But they didn't expect his answer.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.940]   Verse 19, show me the coin used for the poll tax.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.620]   And they brought him a denarius and he said to them,
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.780]   whose likeness and inscription is this?
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.700]   They said to him, Caesar's.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.620]   Then he said to them, and render to Caesar
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.620]   the things that are Caesar's,
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.380]   and render to God the things that are God's.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.580]   If he had a mic, that's when he would drop it, right there.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.500]   Boom, right?
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.980]   They thought they had the perfect trap.
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.420]   How's he going to get out of this one?
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.340]   Render to Caesar's.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.180]   What is Caesar's?
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.060]   Render to God what is God's, right?
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.220]   They're amazed, even verse 22, in hearing this,
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.340]   they were amazed, and leaving him, they went away.
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.180]   It didn't work.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.580]   The trap didn't work.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:04.420]   You know, before we are too easily,
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.980]   you jump to the conclusion,
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.380]   is that today when we say Pharisee,
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.940]   we equate the word Pharisee to what?
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.300]   Hypocrite, right?
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.300]   If you're even a little bit theologically astute,
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.060]   instead of saying hypocrite, say, ah, he's a Pharisee.
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.420]   It's all that we know, we hear, we've studied
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.020]   about the Pharisees in the New Testament,
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.380]   like that's what we mean.
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.380]   You are superficial, you're religious,
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.340]   but you're not real, right?
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.740]   You're whitewashed too, that's what we mean.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.740]   But before we condemn them too quickly,
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.220]   if we understand where the Pharisees came from,
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.980]   their intent, when they started, was a concern
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.300]   because the Jewish people were starting to get Hellenized,
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.380]   and the Greek culture was starting to penetrate,
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.300]   and they started to even speak their language,
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.980]   and they were concerned that the pagans
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.660]   were going to infiltrate into the country,
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.460]   so the Pharisees decided to start a movement of holiness,
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.300]   and that's what Pharisee literally means, to be set apart.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.540]   And that's why they paid so much detailed attention
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.180]   to the law, because they wanted to be holy
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.860]   to the extent that if they kept the law perfectly,
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.380]   like that would bring revival, that God would bless them,
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.980]   and that was at the core intention of the Pharisees.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:25.980]   But as time went by, their righteousness
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.860]   became nothing more than right and wrong.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.540]   They paid more attention to what was going on outside
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.500]   than what was going on inside,
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.540]   and that's why Jesus rebukes them.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.540]   In Matthew 15, seven through nine, you hypocrites,
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.220]   rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you,
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.540]   this people honors me with their lips,
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.780]   but their heart is far from me.
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.300]   In vain do they worship me, teaching and doctrines
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.800]   the precepts of men.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.100]   You see, they started out with good intentions,
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:01.140]   and then they eventually got sidetracked.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.100]   Instead of really worshiping God,
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.940]   their righteousness was a source of honor,
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.220]   and they thought that if we obeyed the law
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.180]   better than the next guy,
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.700]   that we're going to have higher status before God.
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:17.500]   And you know why studying the Pharisees is so important,
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.460]   is because everybody who's been a Christian
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.860]   for more than a year or two or three years,
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.780]   this is at the core of our struggle.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.940]   This is at the core of our struggle,
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.740]   because the glory and the power is at the cross.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.380]   But we can easily become men and women who,
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.900]   because we've been Christians longer,
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.900]   because we're a little bit older,
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.100]   because we study the Bible more,
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.820]   because we're a little bit more gifted,
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:41.860]   because we give more,
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.220]   because we have certain positions in the church,
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.400]   because I went to seminary,
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.900]   because I'm a deacon, I'm an elder, I'm a pastor,
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.660]   because I preach and I bear fruit,
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.440]   we can be easily deceived to think
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.480]   that the work makes me better and more righteous.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.460]   No one is more susceptible to that than the leadership.
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.220]   I am at the center of all of that.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:10.260]   I can easily deceive myself to think that I am righteous
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.420]   because I am doing righteous things.
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.140]   I can easily think that I am the closest to God
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.580]   because I see fruit.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.660]   And I know, better than anybody else,
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.980]   that I could pretend.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.460]   And if I can pretend, I know you can pretend.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.900]   It says in Matthew 23, 25,
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.980]   "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites,
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.820]   "because you travel around on sea and land
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.840]   "to make one proselyte, and when he becomes one,
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.780]   "you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourself."
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:49.220]   You know, why would they be so interested in spreading,
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.780]   spreading Phariseeism?
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.100]   I mean, if they were just hypocrites
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.500]   and concerned about external things,
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.900]   I mean, they devoted themselves to evangelize
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.460]   and tell other people about it.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:06.380]   See, you can easily give yourself to evangelism
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.980]   and world missions, even martyrdom,
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.320]   as Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13, without loving Christ.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.860]   And this is why this is so, so dangerous,
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.980]   because this deception is powerful.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.380]   And the Bible warns us that at the end,
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.740]   there's going to be many people who says to me,
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.560]   "Lord, Lord," and you say,
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.660]   "But your heart was far from me."
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.100]   "Didn't we cast out demons?
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.200]   "Didn't we heal the sick?
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.060]   "Didn't we do this?
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:33.900]   "Didn't we do that?"
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.560]   And you said, "None of that had anything to do with me."
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.940]   If we're not careful, the longer that we have been Christians
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.700]   and the more active we are in the church,
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.300]   we can easily deceive ourselves.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.340]   And that's, you know, I feel compassion
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.900]   when I see the Pharisees, because it started out well.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.740]   It started out well, and just like,
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.660]   just like the core of every human being,
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:05.540]   they started using the law to gain glory for themselves.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.660]   That's why in Luke chapter 11, 30 through 40,
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.560]   it said, "But the Lord said to him,
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.280]   "Now you Pharisees, clean the outside of the cup
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.160]   "and the platter, but inside of you,
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.080]   "you are full of robbery and wickedness."
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.800]   You know, our theme this year is to know him
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.620]   and to make him known, right?
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.460]   And I'm very thankful that we have people
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.060]   who are committed, who are teaching,
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.940]   and who are setting opportunities,
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.020]   and I hope that our church would take advantage of that,
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.120]   and that we would become better witnesses.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:39.340]   But I also know the danger of evangelism
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.940]   when you are not right with God,
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.460]   when it isn't an overflow of worship
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.320]   that leads you to evangelism.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.300]   I've had so many Jehovah Witnesses and Mormons
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:54.060]   coming to my door, and I would have discussions with them,
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.820]   and I could tell that they're not really
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.540]   that interested to engage,
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.540]   because they came to do their duty.
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.100]   They didn't come to argue, they didn't come to discuss,
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:08.120]   they're not really that interested in winning me over.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.060]   They knocked on the door and they're having a conversation
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.340]   because that's part of their duty that they have to do
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.060]   to earn their righteousness.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.100]   So you could tell, like, and they,
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.120]   you could tell they want to go, but I don't let them go.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.540]   'Cause I, you know, I open the door
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.820]   'cause I want to have a discussion with you,
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.180]   I want to turn the pages and I want to have discussion.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.300]   How do you interpret this passage?
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.140]   Where did you get this?
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.060]   And as soon as there's some conflict,
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.100]   you could tell they're one foot headed the other direction.
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.220]   So they're not there to try to win me over,
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.600]   they're doing that because that's what
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.920]   they're supposed to do.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.340]   That's what good Jehovah Witnesses do.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:47.220]   If we're not careful, evangelism can feel that way.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.360]   Just like if you went to a sales rally
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.420]   and they gave you a script, say this and read this,
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.840]   and then you take that script
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.100]   and then you take it to somebody,
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.060]   and then you're teaching them about something
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.840]   that you yourselves would, haven't bought.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.980]   You're not really that crazy about this product, right?
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.900]   I mean, evangelism was meant to be
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.980]   when we see the glory of Christ to go tell other people.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.820]   That's why we are witnesses.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:20.860]   We don't just regurgitate information, right?
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.980]   It's a set of facts that we have
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.820]   to transfer to other people.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.580]   So until we are affected,
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:32.580]   we are in danger of Pharisees if we're not careful.
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.140]   So yes, we want to move forward,
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:39.400]   we want to be evangelistic, but we need to know him first.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.300]   That what we do has to come as an overflow of that.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.580]   The second, the Sadducees, right?
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.020]   I'm just going to summarize what they say
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.060]   for the sake of time.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.540]   Understand who the Sadducees are.
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.700]   The Sadducees were the leaders of Israel,
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.700]   Pharisees were the religious leaders.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.660]   The Sadducees are the one who sat in the Sanhedrin,
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.220]   the senators, kind of like our senators today, right?
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.780]   You know, at least up to now,
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.260]   even if you were a non-Christian,
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.180]   even if you lived like a Buddhist all your life,
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.300]   if you want to be elected in the United States,
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.300]   you have to say you're a Christian, right?
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.420]   If you know anything about politics, that's a given.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.420]   Because 70, 80% of Americans identify with Christianity.
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.500]   Now, obviously, that's not true form of Christianity,
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.920]   but at least superficially.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.300]   So you have to identify with the majority.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.380]   So it's given.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.620]   If you want to run in the United States,
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.060]   whether you're Republican or Democrat, Independent,
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.460]   you have to have some sort of connection
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.600]   to the superficial Christianity.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.020]   So a lot of the senators, presidents, they came out,
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.160]   I remember as a young Christian,
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.380]   as soon as they said they were Christians,
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.180]   oh, he's a Christian, that guy's a Christian,
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.380]   that guy's a Christian.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.620]   And as the years went by, I realized,
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:48.940]   that guy can't be a Christian,
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.540]   that guy can't be a Christian, right?
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.740]   And I realized that they're doing that
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.100]   because they need to get elected.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.180]   Well, the Sadducees were like that.
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:01.640]   They had a loose connection to the Jewish faith,
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.980]   but they didn't believe anything supernatural.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.820]   In fact, they only read the first five books
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.380]   of the Old Testament.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.820]   Anything supernatural, they completely rejected.
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:14.060]   But you know what's interesting about the Sadducees?
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.760]   Sadducees came from the priestly order in Israel.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:26.700]   Okay, let that sink in, okay?
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.940]   These were the people who actually
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.140]   didn't even believe in miracles.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.740]   They rejected the Bible, right?
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.620]   And when they're asking Jesus, like the law says, right?
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.700]   You believe in the law, the law says that if brother dies,
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.820]   that the next of kin has to come and get married,
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:43.860]   and his brother has to marry,
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.380]   and they did the seven times,
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.020]   and when they go to heaven, whose wife is she?
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.460]   And it's a very sarcastic question
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.140]   because they don't believe this.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.540]   They're basically trying to get Jesus to be stumped.
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.700]   Oh, I don't have an answer for that.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.500]   And Jesus said, you know nothing about the scripture.
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.940]   Right, when he says you're mistaken,
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.580]   the word means to be deceived or to be seduced.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.740]   And to think that the people
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.820]   who completely rejected everything about God
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.060]   were the former leaders of Israel.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.800]   So most of the people who sat in Sanhedrin,
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.240]   they were Sadducees.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.240]   All the priests that took care of the temple,
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.280]   majority of them were Sadducees.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.760]   The high priest at that time, Ananias, was a Sadducee.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.840]   And there's a reason why the Pharisees rose up,
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   because the leaders of Israel completely rejected God.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.200]   And so the Pharisees were trying to bring revival
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.720]   from just the people, and they went astray.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.520]   See, they were Jews by heritage and not by faith.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.600]   Do we have those kind of people in the church?
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.160]   Of course.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.600]   Our churches are filled with people
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.440]   who grew up as Christians without true faith.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.240]   And they come to church out of superstition.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.280]   Kind of like if you go to Taiwan,
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.600]   they burn incense because they need
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.240]   to get the blessing from the ancestors.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.760]   And if you ask them, do you really believe that?
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.240]   A lot of them will say, I don't really believe it,
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.480]   but it's more superstition.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.480]   It's more cultural.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:16.480]   Many Christians come to church for the same reasons.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.440]   They don't really believe.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.440]   They don't really believe enough to give all that we have
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.640]   and follow Jesus Christ.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.160]   But there's benefit of being in the church.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.480]   Just in case God is real,
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.680]   at least I have a free ticket to heaven.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.280]   And it's nothing more than that.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.640]   And that's why you can come to church
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.480]   and hear sermons and be challenging
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.880]   and open up the scripture, but it has absolutely no effect.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.880]   There's no application.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.680]   There's no ever application because it's not real.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.600]   You're learning how to put a furniture together
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.760]   that you didn't buy.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.800]   So it's just information and eventually it gets boring.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.720]   So at the center of church life isn't the word.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.400]   It isn't communion.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.240]   It isn't fellowship.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.160]   It isn't evangelism.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.280]   It's just friendship.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.800]   See, those are the Sadducees.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.000]   They were trying to use their influence to advance Israel.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.080]   You know, the most dangerous people in the church
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.320]   are the people who love the church without loving Christ.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.320]   'Cause their perspective is completely skewed.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.880]   What's important to them?
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.600]   What bothers them?
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.440]   What they pour their energy into?
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.880]   It's completely skewed.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.320]   'Cause there is no love for Christ.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.960]   See, those were the Sadducees.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.600]   Jesus shuts them down and after he shuts them down,
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.880]   finally the scribes come.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.160]   They were members of the Pharisees,
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.200]   but the scribes were the religious,
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.440]   among the religious, they were the scholars.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.520]   These were the PhDs.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.000]   These were the guys who actually counted numbers.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.840]   You know, now, because of Bible program,
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.720]   if you wanted to find out how many times
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.760]   the word fish is used in the New Testament,
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.280]   you just probably fish, parameter, New Testament,
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.840]   600 times and it'll come out and oh, how did you get that?
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.760]   You just punched some buttons.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.080]   But before the computer programs,
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.160]   they had strong numbers and concordances
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.240]   and somebody actually sat there,
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.560]   page one, and they counted, they counted.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.000]   So I remember early on when I was giving sermons
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.840]   and every once in a while, I would come across information
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.720]   and said the word agape is used 6075 times in this context.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.080]   And I was like, oh my God, somebody actually counted this.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.360]   They sat there, went through page to page and they counted.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.360]   It's like agape, agape, agape, 653, 657.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.960]   And they wrote that down.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.480]   Then the next word, daw.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.000]   How many word daw is in the New Testament, right?
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.680]   Well, these scribes were these counters.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.720]   They were the experts of the law where they sat there
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.040]   and they scrutinized every single word, every single law,
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.320]   and they counted out of all the laws, 613 laws,
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.880]   and they were constantly debating out of the 613,
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.400]   we can't keep all these perfectly,
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.680]   so which are the weightier and which are the lighter ones?
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.880]   In other words, what are some
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.920]   that we need to pay attention to?
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.120]   What are some that it doesn't really matter?
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.320]   And it is in that context where Jesus says
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.360]   nothing that God says is going to pass away.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.880]   There is no such thing as non-weighty word.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.800]   And it is in answer to that question
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.320]   where Jesus says to them,
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.200]   if you want to know what is the weightiest,
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.920]   what's the most, what is at the core
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.800]   of what God is looking for,
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.080]   is to love the Lord your God
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.760]   with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.680]   The reason why I'm focusing on this this morning
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.720]   is because our church is growing.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.840]   And there's a lot of great things happening in the church.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.880]   I'm very thankful.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.040]   Possibly, who knows, that we would do more work
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.800]   out in Taiwan, the work in India is thriving,
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.560]   and the pastors are spreading the gospel in remote parts.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.120]   And there's a lot of great things
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.600]   that are encouraging in the church.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.440]   You see, but the Jews were not secular.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:11.880]   The Pharisees prayed more than anybody else.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.800]   They gave more than anybody else.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.000]   They proselytized more than anybody else.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.120]   They fasted more than anybody else.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.240]   And yet, it was the Pharisees
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:25.400]   who opposed the ministry of Jesus more than anybody else.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.440]   They've been telling their disciples
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.120]   that the Messiah's going to come and deliver them,
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.840]   but when Messiah finally came,
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.440]   they had no idea who he was.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.480]   Not only did they not receive him as the Messiah,
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.880]   they are the ones who are at the core
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.040]   of wanting to crucify him.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:49.160]   The danger that you and I are in, where we are at,
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.680]   because we are surrounded by religiousness.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.400]   If you grew up in a Christian home,
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.600]   especially if you grew up in a good Christian home,
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.880]   there is a tendency for us to think
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.360]   that somehow through osmosis, you are strong
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.200]   because you saw strong Christians.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.680]   There is a temptation because if you are in a church
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.120]   where the Bible is being taught,
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.640]   that there is a deception to think
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.360]   that the word of God is getting in you.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.080]   If you're around people who pray a lot,
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.760]   that somehow you feel like there's a lot of prayer.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.080]   If you're around a lot of people who do evangelism,
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.880]   that you feel like there's more evangelism going on.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.920]   And we don't carefully examine our hearts
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.040]   if we're not careful.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.280]   See, this, what Jesus is saying
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.880]   was an indictment against Israel.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.160]   Not against not keeping the Sabbath,
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.560]   not against not giving enough,
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:46.680]   or there wasn't enough sacrifices at the temple,
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.400]   but they missed the whole point of their salvation.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.440]   It's because they fell from the glory
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.680]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.320]   That's what he was trying to restore.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.720]   It wasn't, our salvation is not about not going to hell.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.160]   Everybody lives forever.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.640]   The difference is where you're going to spend that eternity.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.360]   It's not eternal life where you're going to be.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.960]   It's the life that was lost
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.120]   because we were pursuing our own glory.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.120]   That's what Jesus meant when he says,
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.280]   if you seek your own life, you will die.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.200]   Because that's not where life is.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.960]   So if you miss what he is saying here,
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.800]   you missed the whole point of Christianity.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.520]   This is not simply a part or important part of Christianity.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.360]   This is Christianity.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.560]   To love Christ.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.680]   You know, you know how different it is
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.680]   when you do something you love
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.120]   versus doing something that you have to do.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.520]   The difference between the two
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.400]   is worship and non-worship.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.360]   That's the difference.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.240]   A worship that God accepts and a worship that God rejects
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.360]   is what is happening with us internally.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.400]   To love the Lord your God
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.760]   with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.320]   He says in Romans 13, six,
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.480]   that all of the law is fulfilled in this commandment,
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.760]   to love.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.840]   We can obey God without loving God,
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.920]   but you can't love God without obeying God.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.240]   We can go and do all these righteous things
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.920]   without loving God.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.880]   We can sacrifice great things without loving God.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.520]   We can evangelize, make disciples without loving God.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.160]   But it is the love of God that leads us to obedience.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:36.600]   That's why in Revelations chapter two, four to five,
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   is a sobering reminder to a good church.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.120]   To a good church, I have this against you,
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.720]   that you have left your first love.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.520]   Therefore, remember from where you have fallen
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.480]   and repent and do the deeds you did at first
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.520]   or else I am coming to you,
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.800]   I will remove your lampstand and out of its place
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.280]   unless you repent.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.000]   The lampstand that he's talking about is the church itself.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.560]   In other words, you can have all this external things
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.400]   and write preaching and write work
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.240]   and doing all this stuff,
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.400]   but he says, but if love is not,
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.680]   the primary thing that God is looking for
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.360]   is true worship and true love,
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.400]   he said if that's not there,
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.480]   he said your church becomes useless.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.760]   He doesn't say your church becomes tainted.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.160]   He doesn't say you're going to get a B instead of an A.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.720]   He says it's completely useless.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.640]   And like I said,
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.800]   the person who is in the greatest danger of that is myself
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.240]   because I'm at the center of that
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.560]   because I'm the one trying to remind you.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.680]   I'm the one teaching the Bible.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.600]   I'm the one directing and leading our congregation.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.720]   And I can easily deceive myself to think
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.720]   God is blessing me, God is blessing the church.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:58.960]   We have to make sure
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:02.880]   that we establish what he is looking for,
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.440]   not what we want in the church.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.320]   The fruit of the spirit, all of it is love.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.240]   1 Corinthians 16, 20,
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.880]   "If anyone does not love Christ,
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.000]   "let him be accursed."
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.880]   Maranatha.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.760]   Paul says, "Why does he persevere in ministry?
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.080]   "For the love of Christ controls us."
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:27.000]   Now, let me wrap up the sermon
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.120]   because we may look at this and say,
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.680]   okay, I need to love Christ more.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.640]   If that's at the core, I need to love Christ more.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.680]   How do you do that?
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.440]   And people will say, in order to answer that question,
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.600]   well, then obey God.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.520]   And we've already established
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.840]   you can obey God without loving God.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.640]   So what does it mean then?
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.560]   Turn off the lights,
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.800]   get all emotional,
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.640]   play emotional music,
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.440]   just play the A minor chord.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.320]   The minor chords tend to be
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.360]   a little bit more emotional than the sharps.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.080]   If you know anything about music,
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.560]   dim the lights.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.800]   I can't cry when the lights are on.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.200]   Dim the lights.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.240]   What does it mean to love God?
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.880]   It's like, okay, just cry.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.840]   Just cry.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.560]   If I cry and if I get emotional,
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:24.800]   does that mean that we love Christ?
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.640]   I mean, I'm being silly,
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.280]   but you know what I mean by that.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.680]   That's not what Jesus means.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.320]   He's not simply saying,
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.520]   if you show greater emotions,
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.680]   maybe you're just an emotional person.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.440]   I know some people who celebrate like this.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.400]   (clapping)
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.560]   I don't get it, but to them,
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.120]   that's exuberance.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.520]   So I can't measure people like emotions
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.800]   because everybody expresses themselves
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.760]   a little bit differently.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.640]   But that's not what he means.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.640]   And this is part one.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.160]   And this really is to introduce us
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.640]   to what I want to speak about next week.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.040]   The Bible does not distinguish
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   between knowing him and loving him,
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.440]   which is the theme of our coming year.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.600]   The Bible does not distinguish
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.440]   between knowing him and loving him.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.960]   The reason why we fall short of loving him
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.760]   is because we are superficial in knowing him.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   We've accepted the gospel so superficially.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.960]   God loves you, has a wonderful plan.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.440]   I'll take it.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.600]   Anybody wants to have salvation,
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.440]   raise your hand, come down,
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.160]   and say, "Oh yeah, I want it."
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.760]   Play some emotional music.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.240]   Your friends went down, we went down,
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.600]   or you went to college,
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.520]   and everybody's taking their faith seriously.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.440]   "Oh, I should too."
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.440]   And then you became a Christian,
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.320]   but you never really thought deeply,
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.200]   "Why does he send his son?"
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:45.640]   Like, why?
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.080]   Why would he do that?
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.760]   Why did he have to die?
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.840]   Why couldn't he just snap his finger
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.880]   and say, "You're forgiven."
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:57.000]   What was the death and the resurrection about?
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:57.920]   What was his ascension?
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.960]   When he said he was going to come,
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.360]   like, what is heaven going to look like?
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.680]   I mean, we've just kind of stopped at,
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.520]   "God loves you, and he died for you,
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.120]   "and he loves you,
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.080]   "and you're going to have eternal life."
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.160]   And we've stopped at, "Yes, that's great.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.560]   "Keep loving me."
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.880]   And we don't realize how much we don't know
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.040]   until you talk to a non-Christian,
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.560]   and they begin to challenge your faith.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.600]   Like, what does that mean?
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.080]   Like, why did you?
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.720]   Why would he die on the cross?
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.440]   Like, what does that mean?
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.400]   Then it's in the context of evangelism,
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:30.400]   we realize, like, "Man, I don't know the gospel."
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.280]   Our love for Christ is defective
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.240]   because we stopped pursuing him
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.360]   at some point in our walk with God.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.400]   You know, that's what happens a lot in marriage, too,
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.600]   and that's why you have marriage problems,
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.200]   because you kind of get married,
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.440]   we're in a covenant relationship,
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.880]   and you just expect it to coast, right?
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.480]   And then when it doesn't coast
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.800]   and drift toward a stronger relationship,
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.520]   you start to go, "Okay, we gotta do something."
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.880]   And then now you start working toward it, right?
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.520]   It's no different in our walk with God.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.080]   We become a Christian,
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.880]   and then because we're in a covenant relationship,
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.880]   one saved, always saved,
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.360]   and we hang our hats on these cliches,
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.640]   and when we don't drift toward God,
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:13.120]   we think something went wrong.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:18.120]   When was the last time you actually pursued Christ,
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:22.400]   longing to know him?
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.280]   Like, really longing, if he's our life,
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.160]   shouldn't that be our primary pursuit?
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.920]   We know more about Kobe's shoe size,
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.680]   where he lives, what kind of car he drives,
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.480]   what kind of helicopter he has, right?
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.240]   His daughters, their names,
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.320]   the number that they wore on their jersey,
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.360]   where he was headed, where he was coming from,
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.480]   who his closest friends were.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.400]   You know, when did he start losing his hair?
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.560]   Like, I mean, we know all kinds of information about Kobe.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.400]   Why?
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:56.480]   Because we idolized him from a distance.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.200]   Because there was an affection for him,
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.360]   we want to know everything about him.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.200]   When was the last time we pursued Christ that way?
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:09.400]   The person that we confess died for my sins.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.080]   He didn't just display his glory and then disappeared.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:16.480]   His glory was him dying for us.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.920]   His glory was taking our sins upon himself
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.320]   and absorbed it upon himself and resurrected
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.480]   and gave up everything for us.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.760]   That was his glory.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.760]   Those are the songs that we sing.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.040]   These are the passages that we memorize.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.240]   When was the last time you pursued this God?
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:40.440]   That you wanted to know him better?
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.160]   You wanted to be near this God?
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.760]   You wanted to have a communion with this God?
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.040]   You just wanted to sit by him and just be near
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.760]   somebody who loves you so much?
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:57.000]   As we head to the new year,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.760]   I pray that we will be known not simply
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.480]   for a church that's growing,
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.200]   not simply for teaching,
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:08.600]   not simply for evangelism,
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.280]   but first and foremost, as he says,
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.040]   that we be a church that loves Christ
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.640]   with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.440]   And let evangelism flow from that.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.360]   Let fellowship flow from that.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:27.280]   Let generosity and mission flow from that.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.240]   So again, all of this is an introduction
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.440]   for really for next week.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.720]   What does that mean then?
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.640]   How do we love Christ?
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.400]   So we'll talk about that next week.
