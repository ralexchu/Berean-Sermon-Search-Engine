[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.840]   - Today's question is about waiting
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.720]   when life seems to be aimless and going nowhere,
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.380]   specifically when it comes to a career
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.800]   and not finding energy or excitement in that career.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.920]   But the implications cover really any kind of waiting.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.060]   This specific question comes to us from Daniel
[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.320]   who asks this, "Dear Pastor John,
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.560]   "I'm a recent college graduate and I feel directionless
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.160]   "as I try to figure out what this time of my life
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.920]   "is supposed to be about and what God has planned for me.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.560]   "In this transition from college into the working force,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.960]   "I feel like I've lost my energy,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.540]   "my purpose, and my direction.
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.920]   "I know that all that I do is for God's glory
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.480]   "and I know that my joy is supposed to be rooted in Christ
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.060]   "and not in my circumstances.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.520]   "But my question is, how should Christians like me
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.620]   "handle this so-called quarter life crisis?"
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.440]   - Well, the first thing to say
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.280]   is that this season will pass.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.280]   But God intends for Daniel to engage
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.900]   in the kind of spiritual warfare
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.640]   that God will use to make it pass.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.440]   That's the place to start, I think.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.440]   And the first strategy in that warfare, that engagement,
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.980]   it seems to me Daniel has already pursued,
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.080]   namely the recognition that this condition
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.040]   of his mind and soul is a kind of crisis
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.880]   and needs to be, as he says, handled.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.720]   How can I handle this?
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.680]   One way to describe the crisis
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.520]   would be that it's perhaps like the well-known
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.520]   ancient spiritual condition called acedia, A-C-E-D-I-A.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.100]   And that comes from the Greek word for neglect.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.520]   But the term acedia came to refer,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.320]   to use the words of one resource I read,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.020]   to a state of listlessness or torpor,
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.420]   of not caring or not being concerned
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.980]   with one's position or condition in the world.
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.340]   And they said it can lead to a state
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.760]   of being unable to perform one's duties in life.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.420]   Its spiritual overtones make it related to,
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.880]   but arguably distinct from, depression.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.060]   So this is like acedia,
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.440]   it sounds like what we're dealing with here.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.820]   So the first strategy is to identify the crisis,
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.200]   look it full in the face, make no denials,
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.720]   identify its nature, and make plans for war.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.220]   Second strategy is to set one's face.
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.580]   Daniel should set his face for a patient,
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.160]   God-centered waiting upon the Lord.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.800]   Not that the waiting will be inactive,
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.420]   but rather it will be a recognition
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.640]   that the victory may take time,
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.880]   and that in the meanwhile,
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.360]   we will not give in to despair.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.920]   So we go to Psalm 40,
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.240]   and we put the words of David on our tongue,
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.940]   I waited patiently for the Lord.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.300]   He inclined to me, heard my cry.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.180]   He drew me up from the pit of destruction
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.300]   out of the miry bog.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.660]   He set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.740]   He put a new song in my mouth,
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.420]   a song of praise to our God.
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.660]   Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.760]   So we take heart that however long
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.900]   the waiting might have to be,
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.940]   David doesn't say, however long we may have to be
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.420]   in the pit or in the miry bog of acedia,
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.220]   listlessness, directionlessness,
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.260]   we will not despair,
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.620]   but will look expectantly to God to act in his time.
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.160]   That's strategy number two.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.060]   Number three, the third strategy,
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.420]   realize that genuine Christians
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.660]   often are marked by this kind of malaise.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.640]   And you see it in, for example, in 1 Thessalonians 5.14.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.580]   We urge you, brothers, admonish the idle.
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.380]   It's an interesting word there, ataktus.
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.380]   It's kind of the chaotic, the disordered,
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.940]   it feels like everything's out of whack.
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.180]   Encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak.
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.360]   Be patient with them all.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.940]   So idle, faint-hearted, weak,
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.740]   that's not unlike what Daniel describes
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.620]   he's feeling these days.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.260]   And Paul recognizes those folks are in the church.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.840]   They need to be cared for.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.960]   That's real Christian experience
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.980]   and real Christian warfare.
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.580]   And the fourth strategy is to put the word of God
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.460]   over against the particular losses that you are feeling.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.740]   And Daniel said, I feel like I've lost my energy,
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.380]   purpose and direction.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.620]   Let me take those one at a time.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.620]   Just put a word of God over against each one.
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.540]   The psalmist says, let's take energy.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.940]   The psalmist says, the Lord is my strength and my shield.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.380]   In him, my heart trusts and I am helped.
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.060]   So the Lord himself is our strength.
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.500]   And the psalmist says that we experience that strength
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.100]   by trusting in him.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.260]   And to be more specific, Nehemiah says,
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.340]   the joy of the Lord is your strength.
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.380]   So pursue the joy of the Lord
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.540]   and you will be pursuing your strength.
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.420]   There is a kind of paradox here.
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.420]   When you feel energy, it's you who feel the energy.
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.460]   When you get up and act,
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.740]   it's you who are getting out of bed and acting.
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.900]   And yet the Bible says, the Lord is your strength.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.300]   Sometimes you hear people say,
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.100]   God helps those who help themselves.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.100]   Well, that's a kind of secular effort
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.460]   to express a biblical truth
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.420]   that secular people cannot understand,
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.020]   and therefore they can't say it right.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.220]   What that is trying to say biblically
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.340]   is God helps the weak
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.460]   and paralyzed and dead to help themselves
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.540]   so that in all our so-called self-help,
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.900]   God will get the glory
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.820]   because all our self-help turned out to be God help.
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.380]   That's what they're trying to say.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.620]   That's the biblical truth.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.220]   And here's the way Paul puts it in 1 Corinthians 15.10,
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.460]   by the grace of God, I am what I am.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.300]   And his grace toward me is not in vain.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.500]   But on the contrary, I worked harder than any of them,
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.740]   though it was not I.
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.020]   But the grace of God that was with me.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.020]   So Daniel, by all means, pursue your restored energy.
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.100]   Seek it in the Lord.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.520]   Seek it in the joy of the Lord.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.900]   And when you have sought it and trusted him for it,
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.340]   get out of bed and do the next thing that needs to be done.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.780]   And then over against the sense of loss of direction,
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.420]   I would put 2 Thessalonians 3, 5,
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:44.180]   may the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.220]   and the steadfastness of Christ.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.220]   And what that text shows is that the Lord himself
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.320]   is the great heart director.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.180]   When we need direction,
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.180]   we plead for our hearts to experience God's direction.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.080]   It's precisely the heart that Daniel needs direction for,
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.820]   not just his head, not just his body,
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.660]   the heart is the great life director.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.660]   And behind the heart is the Lord.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.480]   And so pray that God would direct the heart
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.900]   first to the love of God
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.100]   and then to the steadfastness of Christ.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.560]   And then in that love and in that steadfastness
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.660]   to the clarity you need for your life's work.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.060]   And then lastly, Daniel says,
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.620]   he feels like he's lost purpose.
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.940]   And over against that, I want to put 1 Peter 2, 9,
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.460]   you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.140]   a people for his own possession.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.360]   That, that's the purpose statement,
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.460]   that you may proclaim the excellencies of him
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.120]   who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.820]   Whatever else God has for you in life,
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.540]   this is crystal clear.
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.540]   You exist to make the excellencies of God known,
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.700]   especially the excellencies by which he calls people
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.460]   from darkness to light.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.780]   And it is a marvelous light, Daniel.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.440]   As much listlessness as you may feel just now,
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.440]   you live in marvelous light and it's your purpose.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.060]   God appointed purpose to see it, to savor it,
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.940]   and to make it known.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.740]   Put one more specific text over against that loss of purpose.
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.980]   1 Peter 4, 10, as each has received a gift,
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.740]   use it to serve one another
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.220]   as good stewards of God's varied grace.
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.740]   You, Daniel, like every Christian, have gifts from God.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.060]   These gifts are peculiar to you,
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.020]   peculiar means by which only you
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.700]   can steward God's particular grace to you.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.620]   Your purpose in life is to use those gifts
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.240]   to steward that grace for the glory of God.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.860]   So let me end with just this encouragement
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.300]   from Lamentations 3.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.460]   Jeremiah was very low, as he wrote this,
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.380]   in his sense of helplessness
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.420]   as his beloved Jerusalem was being devastated.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.420]   And he cries out, "My soul continually remembers it
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.100]   "and is bowed down within me."
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.740]   And then he does battle with this crisis that he's in,
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.500]   and he says, "But this I call to mind."
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.220]   There you go, Daniel, that's what you do.
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.700]   "This you call to mind, and therefore I have hope.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.100]   "The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.780]   "His mercies never come to an end.
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.320]   "They are new every morning.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.000]   "Great is your faithfulness.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.800]   "The Lord is my portion, says my soul.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.460]   "Therefore I will hope in him."
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.060]   So call God's promises to mind, Daniel.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.260]   Hope in him and move.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.260]   God will, he will, as you move in his strength,
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.620]   he will restore the joyful sense of energy
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.040]   and direction and purpose.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.300]   Amen, excellent words for Daniel
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.620]   and for anyone who faces this season
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.560]   of aimlessness in life.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.760]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.060]   And these are the types of life questions
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.420]   that we address here on the podcast.
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.460]   And for more information about what we do

[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.320]   Well, I wanna stay on this topic of jobs
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.860]   and career for next time
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.980]   because good jobs can be very scarce.
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.820]   So will God call us to work that we will not enjoy?
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.380]   How do we handle the calling question
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.140]   when it comes to work that seems unenjoyable?
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.380]   That's the question tomorrow.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.300]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.740]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.800]   with John Piper.
