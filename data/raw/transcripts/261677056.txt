[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 12.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.440]   We're reading starting from verse 9 all the way to verse 16.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.960]   But our focus today is going to be on 15 and 16.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.440]   Romans chapter 12 verse 9 through 16.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.440]   Let love be genuine.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.440]   Abhor what is evil.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.000]   Hold fast to what is good.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.680]   Love one another with brotherly affection.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.240]   Outdo one another in showing honor.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.800]   Do not be slothful in zeal.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.120]   Be fervent in spirit.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.120]   Serve the Lord.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.240]   Rejoice in hope.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.920]   Be patient in tribulation.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.680]   Be constant in prayer.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.120]   Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.600]   Bless those who persecute you.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.920]   Bless and do not curse them.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.200]   Rejoice with those who rejoice.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.680]   Weep with those who weep.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.040]   Live in harmony with one another.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.900]   Do not be haughty but associate with the lowly.
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.920]   Never be wise in your own sight.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.160]   Let's pray.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.760]   Yes Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:10.240]   We thank you for your living word, your very breath that causes us to see, to be convicted,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.120]   as a light onto our path, to know you, to know your voice.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.360]   I pray Father God that from this pulpit that only the voice of Christ may go.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.460]   That your children may hear his voice and follow him and him only.
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.640]   We pray for your grace this morning.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.640]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.640]   Amen.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.120]   All right, so as you guys know, just as a quick review, we're on chapter 12 where Paul
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.360]   has made a transition from the indicatives to the imperatives where he was talking about
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.640]   the doctrine of justification and then the ramification of that in the life of a Christian.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.760]   And so in the previous weeks we've been talking about the imperatives, the about 20 some imperatives
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.260]   that we see starting from verse 9 all the way to verse 21.
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.960]   And in these imperatives we can wrap up the whole imperatives in love the Lord your God
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.480]   with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength and love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.520]   So remember we talked about how the scripture says that all of the law can be summarized
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.960]   by this, by love.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.180]   It is the greatest attraction to Christ.
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.320]   When we talk about the gospel there is a temptation for us to skim over the judgment of God and
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.800]   get to the love of Christ because it is attractive.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.480]   Christians and non-Christians, if you take a step back and look at the totality of the
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.040]   message of the gospel, it's about the God of the universe who created us, who emptied
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.520]   himself and became nothing to save sinners who are hostile toward him.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.200]   We can imagine a story like that.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.720]   We can come up with a story and say, "Well, that's a beautiful story."
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.800]   There is nothing that comes close to the gospel message and the love that we celebrate, we
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.640]   sing about, memorize, we study.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.520]   And so we know that the greatest attraction to the church, the greatest attraction to
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.160]   the gospel message is this agape love that Paul has been talking about.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.600]   It is central to the gospel message, it is central to the attraction, it is central to
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   practice.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.200]   When we talk about discipleship, oftentimes we talk about being disciplined.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.680]   You know, somebody who didn't do quiet time before to do quiet time, if you don't pray
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.280]   to pray, if you haven't witnessed to go witnessing, to do missions, and all of these things are
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.240]   commanded in scripture.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.320]   But the scripture also says you can do all of that and yet not have love, and it means
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.740]   absolutely nothing.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.960]   You can be disciplined, you can be a spiritual giant, at least on the surface, and at the
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.840]   end, all we are without love is whitewashed tombs.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.840]   We look great on the outside, but inside we're just as sinful, just as selfish, just as self-focused
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.020]   than we were before we were converted.
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.260]   So at the core of discipleship is to become like Christ in His love, and that's exactly
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.260]   what Jesus says, that the world will know that you are my disciples if you have love
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.060]   for one another as I have loved you.
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.340]   Now, He's not talking about just any kind of love.
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.800]   He's not talking about the kind of love that the world practices, which every non-Christian,
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.520]   other religion, everybody else practices.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.260]   They practice love with their brothers and sisters, with their friends, and sometimes
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.520]   with strangers, but the love that Jesus is speaking about is in Romans 5 way in that
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.620]   why we were yet sinners.
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.100]   He gave His only begotten son's life for sinners who are hostile toward Him.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.340]   That is not a love that we see, that is not a love that is taught, and that is not a love
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.020]   maybe even valued in our culture because it is so out of the ordinary, it is not practiced.
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.400]   So what distinguishes us from the world is not simply that we are nice people who love
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.220]   our children and good to our friends and neighbors, but it is this kind of love that the world
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.200]   would not understand.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.180]   Why would you make yourself vulnerable to strangers and even enemies?
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.580]   Our natural instinct is to protect ourselves.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.920]   Our natural instinct is self-preservation.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.760]   But to practice this agape love is to abandon ourselves, and that is exactly what it is.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.840]   It is a call to abandon ourselves, to make ourselves vulnerable.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.120]   It goes directly against our natural instinct, and yet the scripture says that that is at
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.100]   the core of what it means to be a follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.860]   So all the imperatives that we have been looking at in verse 9 through 21, it may not use the
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.200]   word love, but at the end of the day it is a means to the goal of becoming a person who
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.160]   practices love.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.800]   So we went through all these different principles.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.120]   Today's sermon number 6, we are looking at number 13 and 14 in verses 15 and 16.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.740]   So the first principle, or at least that we are covering today, A. Biblical love rejoices
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.780]   with those who rejoices and weeps with those who weeps.
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.640]   It rejoices with those who rejoice and weeps with those who weep.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:08.200]   This is the picture of a Christian community where Christ is the head and we are all different
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.400]   body parts of the church, and this is the picture of Christianity.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.840]   This is the picture of God-centered, Christ-centered Christianity.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:25.480]   Of self-centered, self-focused individual will not practice this, cannot practice this.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.720]   To be able to rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep, it requires
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.720]   self-abandonment.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:41.680]   Remember we talked about how at the core of human rebellion is self-preservation, self-gratification,
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.200]   and self-glorification.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.400]   So this call to love, it challenges every part of that.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.640]   And when he says to rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep, someone
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:01.120]   who is self-centered can superficially say, "You know what, I feel your pain.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.080]   I feel the sorrow."
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.640]   Or "I rejoice with you superficially."
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.440]   Kind of like on Facebook, thumbs up, thumbs down.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.440]   You know what I mean?
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.880]   "Oh, I rejoice with you."
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.760]   "Oh, that's pretty sad."
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.740]   When was the last time you've really wept for someone else that wasn't linked to your
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.080]   family member or wasn't you?
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.320]   It wasn't your dad, it wasn't your mom, but somebody that you don't really know that well,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.920]   that you really were on your knees praying because you agonized over their suffering?
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.800]   When was the last time you really rejoiced over something good that happened to somebody
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.560]   that didn't directly affect you?
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.160]   When something good happens to somebody close to you, that's great, maybe they'll buy me
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.160]   dinner.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.920]   Maybe, maybe I'm going to benefit somehow, but genuinely rejoiced over something good
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.040]   happen to somebody else without feeling a sense of jealousy.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.920]   See what he's asking us to practice, what he's commanding us to practice, ultimately
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.920]   is not something that you can practice in your flesh.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.200]   You don't just turn that on and off.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.360]   Jesus obviously is the perfect example that we see in Hebrews chapter 4, 14 through 16,
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.920]   or 15 through 16, "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.320]   weaknesses.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.360]   But one who in every respect has been tempted as we are yet without sin.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.480]   Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.200]   and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.560]   The word for sympathy is "sum pathēo."
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.640]   It basically means to have the same feeling.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.440]   And the reason why he can have the same feeling, meaning that he rejoices with us and he weeps
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:48.520]   with us, is because he says in every respect he has been tempted as we are yet without
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.160]   sin.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.760]   And that's the gospel message, that God emptied himself and he walked in our shoes, and he
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.320]   suffered as we suffered.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.840]   You ever wonder why Jesus waited until he was 30 years old before he started his ministry?
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.280]   Why did he do it when he was 13?
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.220]   Would his sacrifice have been any less?
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.960]   If he was 15 or 18?
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.920]   You know in the Jewish community at 13 they have Bar Mitzvah and that's when they officially
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.360]   become an adult, but he waited until he was 30 years old.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.840]   It doesn't say, it doesn't explicitly say that that's the reason, but in the Old Testament
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.600]   a priest was considered an intern until he turned the age of 30.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.040]   Because he was at the age of 30 where they considered that an individual lived a full
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.360]   life, full human life, that you weren't just an adult, but that you experienced what a
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.600]   human being would experience.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.800]   So at 30 they would stop being interns and able to serve at the temple independently,
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:49.400]   because that's the age where they considered them to be able to have experienced life.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.600]   It doesn't explicitly say that, but my guess is that's probably why, that at the age of
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.840]   30 that Jesus experienced all that he was able to experience.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.200]   And he walked in our shoes, in John chapter 1, verse 14 it says, "The Word became flesh
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.720]   and dwelt among us.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.440]   We have seen his glory, glory as the only son of the Father, full of grace and truth."
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:17.020]   You know the interesting word here for dwelt in Greek literally means to pitch a tent.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:22.080]   That he didn't just walk among us, he pitched a tent just like the Israelites who were constantly
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.680]   living in these tents.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.600]   He said that he came and he actually pitched his tent among us, he lived with us.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.960]   He didn't just have compassion from a distance, he actually came and walked.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.880]   You ever wonder why after Jesus is baptized he goes to the wilderness and he's tempted?
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.840]   And Satan comes and he tempts him.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.180]   Think about the ridiculousness of this temptation.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:49.640]   Because Satan himself probably knows, not probably, I'm almost certain he knows who
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.840]   Jesus is.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.320]   Jesus is his creator.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:01.320]   His disciples, Satan's disciples, the demons, remember what they did when they saw Jesus?
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.800]   They fell down on their knees in terror.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.240]   "Son of God, why have you come before your time to torture us?"
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.920]   They knew that the judgment was going to come through his son, Jesus.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.640]   So they knew exactly who he was.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:19.800]   So why did Satan think that he was going to come and tempt Jesus by saying, "If you bow
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:25.240]   down to me, I'm going to give you this, like this.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.840]   Give me your Lamborghini and I'll give you a Snickers."
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:33.640]   To me, that proposition in and of itself makes no sense.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.280]   Because he knew that Jesus was the creator.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.400]   But there was something about his incarnation.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.240]   There was something about him emptying himself of the glory and taking on human form that
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:52.680]   he probably would have never seen in his existence if the whole purpose or whole rebellion of
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.780]   Satan is to usurp his glory.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:03.400]   And there was absolutely no chance ever in human history or in his life that he probably
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.840]   ever looked at God and said, "You know what?
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.240]   One of these days I'm going to just overthrow this God."
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:15.160]   But for the first time in his existence, he saw Jesus in his humanity and thought, "Maybe
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.720]   he has a chance."
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.800]   There was something about his humility, something about his human form that made him weaker
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.440]   than he's ever seen.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.240]   Before his humanity, remember, Satan, even just to be in the presence of God, he needed
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.860]   to get permission to enter his presence.
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.440]   Even if he wants to hurt people, he needed to get permission.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.160]   Remember, Jesus says that in Luke 22?
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.640]   Satan has asked permission to sift you like wheat.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.600]   He needed to get permission to even act.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:50.520]   Yet he was in the presence of this incarnated Christ, and he actually is trying to tempt
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   him.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:57.200]   There was something in his humanity, the fact that he walked among us and he's tempted in
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:04.400]   every way and yet without sin, that made him seem weaker than he's ever been.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.440]   And he pitched a tent where we were at.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:16.880]   A person who lives a self-centered life will never really be able to pray, never really
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.120]   be able to weep with those who weep.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:28.040]   You know, I think the struggle that we have with prayer is that we're not passionate about
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.400]   the things that we're praying for.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.640]   I think all Christians pray if it matters, if it really matters.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.460]   If you're in a situation where you're in dire need of something and you can't stop thinking
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.960]   about it, you end up praying.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.600]   You may not be on your knees and you may not have time devoted to prayer, but you end up
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.520]   praying.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:53.280]   If you can't make your ends meet, you wake up praying.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.840]   You wake up in the middle of the night, "Lord, help me."
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.400]   You end up praying.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.120]   When someone is sick and they're in dire need, you have no other way to turn, you pray.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:08.080]   You may not have formal prayer, you wake up in prayer.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.960]   There's some college students here who did not study this whole quarter and finals are
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.680]   coming up, and I know your prayer requests.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:26.080]   You woke up in the morning and said, "Lord, I do not ask for justice, I ask for mercy."
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.200]   If it's important enough, we will pray.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:36.240]   It's because we are detached, because our natural instinct in our flesh is self-preservation,
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.320]   self-gratification, self-glorification, so when it doesn't come into that circle, we're
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.000]   distant.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.160]   So even when people come to Christ, even though the scripture says that heavens are celebrating,
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.840]   it's hard to rejoice with them.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.760]   We just watch from a distance, it's like, "Oh, that's great."
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.560]   Thumbs up.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.200]   Somebody's in dire need and they're suffering, it's like, "Oh, thumbs down, I don't like
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.640]   that."
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:11.640]   But to really weep with those who weep and rejoice with those who rejoice.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.360]   This is the community, this is the kingdom that God has called us to participate in.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:24.920]   If we're in a constant state of self-preservation, eventually you will find yourself isolated.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:30.660]   Isolated from your friends, who are friends at one point, isolated from co-workers at
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:35.280]   some point, and at times even isolated from your wife, from your husband, and eventually
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.920]   even with your own kids.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.880]   To rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep, God calls us to empty
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.480]   ourselves.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.920]   The second thing that we want to look at this morning, and we're going to spend more time
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.560]   in, biblical love lives in harmony with one another.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.600]   Biblical love lives in harmony with one another.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.480]   I want you to look at the NASB version of this text, because I feel like the ESV, you
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.200]   kind of miss it.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.280]   The NASB is a bit more clear, more literal to the text.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.080]   In the NASB it says, "Be of the same mind toward one another.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.800]   Do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.000]   Do not be wise in your own estimation."
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.040]   Do you notice the theme that is running across this verse?
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.000]   You don't see in the ESV?
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.520]   What do you see?
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.080]   What do you see?
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.880]   The morning crowd got it immediately.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.080]   You guys must be tired.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.480]   Mind.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.480]   The focus is on the mind.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.760]   He said, "Be of the same mind."
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.360]   In the ESV it says, "Live in harmony with one another."
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.360]   The literal translation is, "Be the same mind.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.880]   Do not be haughty in mind, associate with the lowly.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.960]   Do not be wise in your own estimation."
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:58.240]   So all of it, the theme that runs across this text, is to live in harmony, is to be of the
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.160]   same mind, in the same type of thinking.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.640]   And over and over again in the scripture, we are commanded to do that very thing.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.080]   First Corinthians 110, "I appeal to you brothers by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:14.280]   all of you agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.960]   mind."
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.960]   Same judgment.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.360]   Philippians 127, "I want to let your manner of life worthy of the gospel of Christ, so
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:24.520]   that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you may be standing
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:29.800]   firm in one spirit with one mind, striving side by side for the faith of the gospel."
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.520]   Philippians 2.2, "Complete my joy by being of the same mind."
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.560]   Having the same love, being in full accord with one mind.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:43.840]   1 Peter 3.8, "Finally all of you have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.880]   heart and a humble mind."
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:52.920]   Over and over and over again, the scripture commands us to be of the same mind.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.920]   How do we do that?
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.840]   Do we just decide, like, let's just think the same thing, everybody.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.680]   Close your eyes and focus on this.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.960]   We're going to be on the same mind.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.080]   How do we come to the same mind?
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.680]   I think it's pretty clear, right?
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:11.080]   The scripture says in Romans 12.2, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.080]   by what?
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.680]   By the renewing of our mind."
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:20.040]   Every single one of us, before we became a Christian, has all kinds of opinions.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.800]   We all have opinions about how to raise our kids, about what is right and what is wrong.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.280]   So politically, we're divided.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.840]   We're divided by finance.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.640]   We're divided by where we live.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:35.800]   Because we all have different opinions about what should be and should not be.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.560]   And if we're not careful, we bring that into the church, and we have people who are Democrats
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.720]   and Republicans outside of the church who hate each other, and then you're trying to
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.320]   superficially unite.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.340]   But we have all kinds of different opinions.
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.080]   And what he's saying is to be of the same mind, first and foremost, our minds have to
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.960]   be transformed by his word.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.920]   What we consider to be right and wrong has to be influenced and being transformed by
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.120]   his word.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:08.640]   What we consider to bring joy to our lives, our values, our pursuit, what should be, should
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.520]   not be, has to be from his word.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.280]   How do you get people from all walks of life who is not being transformed in mind to be
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.280]   of one in the church?
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.640]   It's impossible.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.560]   You ever try to have five or six different friends who have strong opinions to decide
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.840]   what to eat?
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.840]   It's frustrating.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.240]   I used to have a group of friends like that in college.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.640]   We would get together, and we could never go anywhere together because you don't need
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.640]   everybody.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.980]   You have 11 people, but you have two guys who are absolutely convinced that where and
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.840]   what they want to do has to be.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.400]   And so everybody just is waiting, you know, but these two guys just will not let go.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.640]   No, we have to eat McDonald's.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.360]   No, we have to go eat, you know, Chinese food.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.360]   And these both of them just will not give.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.440]   And we would sit there and let them argue it out, but no one loses.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.080]   So in the end, we don't eat.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.800]   As I used to joke around when people would ask me, "Hey, Peter, where are you going?"
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.240]   I said, "I'm going to go hang out with my friends and discuss about what we're going
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.700]   to do, and then I'll be back."
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.600]   You can't even get people to eat together when you have people who are strong opinions
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.600]   and they won't give in.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:27.560]   Can you imagine building a community, striving after God, making important decisions with
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.760]   a church filled with people who are filled with their own opinion who is not being governed
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.640]   by the Word of God?
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.280]   So first and foremost, he says we have to be of the same mind.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.080]   That's why we need to be committed to the Word of God.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.520]   We need to continually be transformed by the Word of God.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.680]   You know, a general principle about all of this is if you're not regularly being transformed
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:56.640]   by the Word of God, it is safe for you and for me to stay quiet.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.720]   Because the more we express our opinion and the more you run into other people's opinion,
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.560]   the more the church gets divided.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:10.440]   So as a general rule, we need to be saturated with God's Word, the Word of God, and doctrine
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:17.800]   that we need to work toward a unifying understanding of who God is and what he desires.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:23.360]   But this call to unity of mind isn't just talking about doctrine.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.640]   Because you can have unity of doctrine, unity of thought in what the Word of God says and
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.280]   still be divided.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.360]   He's talking about more than that.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.440]   In Philippians chapter 2, 5-7, it says, "Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:41.040]   in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not consider equality with
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:45.760]   God something to be grasped, but it paid himself nothing.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.640]   Taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men."
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.840]   So he said, "Have this mind among yourselves."
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.040]   The mind he's talking about here is not simply talking about right view of Jesus.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:02.340]   He's talking about being humble, of emptying himself, considering others better than themselves.
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.920]   Having the right mind isn't just simply having right doctrine.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:14.560]   But the right doctrine calls us to no longer be self-centered and self-seeking and self-glorified.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.380]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.480]   Was Jesus an introvert or an extrovert?
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.480]   Don't answer.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.480]   I just want you to think about it for a minute.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.480]   Was he an introvert or an extrovert?
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.720]   I think he was an extrovert because he spent a lot of time in public.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.560]   He preached a lot and was constantly surrounded by people, so he must be an extrovert.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:42.240]   And then some of you guys who may remember, he would always pull away from the crowd to
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.240]   be alone.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.240]   That sounds like an introvert.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:50.240]   Is he an introvert or an extrovert?
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:57.160]   You ever take that test with ENTJ, INSF, ENOW, whatever that is?
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.120]   So you have all these personality tests.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.080]   Which one was he?
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:05.320]   And you might try to apply different things to him.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.320]   Which one was he?
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.000]   Was he an introvert or was he an extrovert?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.360]   He was none and he was everything.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.160]   Because the scripture says that he emptied himself.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.020]   He emptied himself.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.400]   His core was servanthood.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.720]   Isn't that exactly what Paul says?
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.580]   I became all things to all people by all means that I can save some.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:37.240]   So who he was before he met Christ was no longer relevant.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   You know, we talk about how when I was younger, there was a book that came out, it was so
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.280]   popular, "Women are from Mars and Men are from Venus."
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.480]   And all this psychologists are trying to connect.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.500]   How does men from Mars and women from Venus communicate with each other?
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.600]   And that's kind of like how a lot of the psychological books and marriage counseling, all this stuff
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.840]   came from this idea of we're two completely different people.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.120]   How do you communicate?
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:10.040]   But the premise that is wrong about all of that is that God didn't create us to be on
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.040]   Mars and Venus to begin with.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.080]   He created us on Earth.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.920]   And then men drifted to Mars and then women drifted to Venus.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.080]   And the problem is to come back to Earth.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.080]   That's the problem.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.080]   That's the solution.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.600]   But we're trying to figure out, like, okay, you have two people who've decided that this
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.240]   is who they are and they're not going to budge.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:42.480]   So how do you get these two people, who are self-seeking, self-glorifying, and self-preserving,
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.200]   to get along?
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.320]   And that's the wisdom of this world.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.800]   But what Christ does, he comes and he says, "No, you have been crucified with Christ.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:59.840]   He is no longer you who lives, so wherever you are at, it no longer is relevant."
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.560]   I remember when I was younger, I used to wrestle so much with my own identity because we moved
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.840]   around so much.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.120]   I naturally enjoy being with people, but I also enjoy being by myself.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.120]   I don't know what I am.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:18.080]   Some people say, "Oh, you're a hidden introvert," or "You're an extrovert who doesn't know."
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:24.120]   I've been psychoanalyzed by the church, and I don't know who I am.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.800]   But I remember when I was younger, I used to really wrestle with that because every
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.640]   year I'm at a new place.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.280]   And so I had to be a new guy, and of course I don't have any friends, so I have to adjust.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.480]   And so by the time I became 14, 15, I completely, I had no idea who I was.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.800]   So early on in college, I was wrestling with that because with some people, I'm very outgoing.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.520]   And then there's some people, I say nothing.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:50.560]   And depending on which friends they were, they probably thought, "Oh, Peter, he never
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.560]   says anything."
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.320]   In fact, I had a group of friends that when I first became a Christian, that they were
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.320]   all fobs.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.880]   They only spoke Korean.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.280]   And so I only spoke Korean to them, and one time I was at a birthday party, and I was
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.800]   trying to share the gospel in English, and they turned around and said, "Oh my gosh,
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.920]   you speak English."
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.760]   And then I remember turning around, I was like, "What?
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.240]   I've known these guys for two years."
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.160]   But the whole time, because that's who they were.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.680]   And I remember really wrestling with that.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:26.480]   And the end of all of that, my conclusion was, "So what?"
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.280]   I remember a speaker a long time ago gave a message saying, "Everybody's trying so hard
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.720]   to find who they are, and they're looking inward."
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.560]   And then he said, "What if at the end of the day, you spend all your life trying to find
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:42.440]   who you are, and you find out that you're an onion?"
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.480]   There's nothing at the core.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.080]   All it is is skin.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.020]   And the point was, stop looking inward.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.560]   We have been crucified with Christ.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.920]   Our old life is dead.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.000]   Our new life and new identity is found in Christ.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.680]   And the reason why we are divided is because of our self-preservation.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:09.640]   This is who I am, and I am looking for people who are going to adjust to me.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.200]   And that is the root of division.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.920]   That is the root of argument.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.560]   That is the root of marriage problems.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.520]   That is the root of conflict.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.440]   This is who I am, and I want you to adjust to me.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:30.680]   We are divided by age, by race, by socioeconomic backgrounds, style of worship, how we do discipleship,
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:37.240]   the preaching style, how we dress, what Bible translation, what theological persuasion that
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:44.080]   are not core issues, what school a pastor graduated seminary, how we raise our children,
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.480]   what kind of social justices are important to us.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:55.080]   I mean, it takes so little to divide us when we start with the core of ourselves.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.960]   He says, do not be high-minded.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.160]   Do not raise yourself.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:06.520]   A high-minded person will never associate with the lowly, physically, economically,
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:13.860]   socially, and even spiritually, because he is looking for somebody who is equal or better.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.120]   And he says, do not be haughty.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.720]   Do not see yourself that way.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.920]   He says, but associate with the lowly and do not be conceited.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.080]   You know, in India, they have this caste system.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.080]   I think many of you know that.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.600]   Officially, it's illegal.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.120]   But obviously, it's practiced because a lot of the caste system is inside their heart.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:39.200]   So they have about seven different caste systems, but on the top of that are the Lingayats.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.680]   The Lingayats are the priests, the Hindu priests.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.320]   If you are a Lingayat, you pretty much made it.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.440]   If you are born into the Lingayat family, you can pretty much marry whoever you want
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.240]   to marry because everybody wants their daughter or son to marry a Lingayat.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.480]   But rarely will they intermarry outside of the Lingayats because to them, it means to
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.240]   sacrifice something.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:06.420]   And then the lowest of the totem pole, they actually call themselves the Untouchables.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:10.340]   And I thought they were kidding when they first said, oh, we're Untouchables.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.920]   But that's the actual name for that group, Untouchables.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.240]   So you can imagine which group are more receptive to the gospel.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.880]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.200]   It's the Untouchables.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.760]   It's the Untouchables that first come to Christ.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.360]   So superficially, you may look at that and say, oh, maybe because they're uneducated.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.360]   They got nothing to lose.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.480]   And you can socially explain all of that, but the Bible has a better explanation.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:42.620]   It says it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven because the rich man
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.440]   is filled with himself.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.800]   He's got too much to lose to associate with the lowly.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.200]   If you're a slave owner and you go there and you're hanging out with slaves, former slaves,
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.560]   he's got much to lose.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:02.160]   And so the Lingayats are very reluctant to come to Christ because they're unwilling to
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.680]   give up what it is they think they have.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:12.560]   The Untouchables, on the other hand, meeting Christ means everything.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.440]   And that is not different because whether you are rich or poor, every single one of
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:21.400]   us, that's why the law came to show the utter sinfulness of mankind.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.220]   That whether you are rich or an aristocrat or whether you are a Roman citizen, whatever
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:30.620]   you were, whether you were the lowly of the human beings, at least according to this world,
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:35.800]   the law came to make sin utterly sinful in order to humble all of us.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.680]   Wherever, whatever standing, no matter how good-looking you are, no matter how much money
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:46.400]   you make, the starting point of the gospel is to bring us down and humble us, to empty
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.400]   us.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:52.240]   And until we are empty, until we recognize who we are, until we lose confidence in our
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:58.160]   own judgment, our personalities, our looks, our money, until we lose absolute confidence
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:03.840]   in all of that and come before that in repentance, in humility, you cannot enter the kingdom
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.960]   of heaven.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.800]   The beginning point of salvation is to be empty.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:16.400]   See that when he says not to think of yourself haughty, he's not talking about fake humility.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.320]   He's not talking about walking around saying, "I'm the humblest."
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.600]   Because the moment you say that, you're not.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.800]   I'm the humblest in the world, right?
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.800]   That's an oxymoron.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.000]   That's a contradiction.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:40.040]   Tim Keller says in his short book, "The Gift of Forgetfulness," true gospel humility means
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:45.320]   to stop connecting every experience, every conversation with myself.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.760]   In fact, I stopped thinking about myself.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:52.560]   The freedom of self-forgetfulness, the blessed rest that only self-forgetfulness brings.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:59.240]   He also says superiority complex and inferiority complex are basically the same.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.240]   Whether you think you're superior to other people, whether you're constantly telling
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:08.400]   yourself you're inferior, the starting point is the same.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:13.000]   That there is too much attention on yourself.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.280]   Too much concern for yourself.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:24.840]   Self-preservation, self-gratification, self-glorification is at the root of superiority complex or inferiority
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.360]   complex.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.240]   He also says the way the normal human ego tries to fill its emptiness and deal with
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:37.920]   its discomfort is by comparing itself to others all the time.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.040]   He quotes C.S. Lewis from "Mere Christianity," and he says this.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.720]   This is C.S. Lewis' quote.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:50.320]   "Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.520]   person.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:56.600]   We say that people are proud of being rich or clever or good-looking, but they are not.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.000]   They are proud of being richer or cleverer or better-looking than others.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.520]   If everyone else became equally rich or clever or good-looking, there would be nothing to
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.520]   be proud about."
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:13.880]   See, at the core of human sin is self-focus.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:19.260]   And it is our self-focused life that causes us to keep people who are difficult to love
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:20.760]   at bay.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:27.280]   See, at the root of agape love is the gospel message.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.400]   At the root of it.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.880]   He says to never be conceited.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.320]   Proverbs 26, 12.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.520]   "Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes?
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.320]   There is more hope for a fool than for him."
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.320]   Isaiah 5, 21.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:45.000]   "Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and shrewd in their own sight."
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.080]   Again in 1 Corinthians 3, 18-23.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.000]   You know about this church.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.560]   They are fighting over preferences.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.960]   This church was divided because a group of them was saying, "No, no, no.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.920]   Peter is the guy that we need to be loyal to."
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:07.880]   You can understand their logic behind that because Peter was a leader among the apostles.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.320]   And so Peter is our man.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.520]   He's the one we need to listen to.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.920]   And then some were saying, "You know what?
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.440]   Apollo seems to know the Old Testament better than anybody else.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.760]   He was expositing and he was pointing to Christ before he ever even met Christ.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.280]   So Apollo clearly knows the Bible and we need to be loyal to him."
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.600]   And then some people were saying, "Apostle Paul was the one who's risking his life being
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   beaten.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.880]   He's the one who brought the gospel to Corinth."
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.880]   And some were above all of that.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.880]   No, we're about Jesus.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.760]   And so every one of them were fighting for their opinion of who they should be loyal
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.200]   to.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.240]   And this division in the church has caused all kinds of problems in the church.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.880]   They allowed all kinds of immorality.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.400]   It caused the communion table to be divided.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:57.520]   People who had spiritual gifts were speaking out of turn and they just would not let go.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.880]   And it caused all kinds of problems.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.920]   As a result of that, Paul writes this nasty letter to them, "Shall I come to you with
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.000]   a whip?"
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.280]   And because they didn't want to hear what Paul had to say, they started questioning,
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.200]   "Okay, see, Paul is not an apostle."
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.760]   That's why he's saying, "Oh, if he really was an apostle, he would recognize that we
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.760]   are right."
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:22.880]   And then he has to write a second letter defending his apostleship because they didn't want to
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.880]   listen.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:29.080]   And it's in that context he's writing this letter and he says, "Let no one deceive himself.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:34.000]   If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.440]   may become wise.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.400]   For the wisdom of this world is folly with God.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.800]   For it is written, 'He catches the wise in their craftiness.'
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.640]   And again, the Lord knows the thoughts of the wise.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.520]   They are futile.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.360]   Let no one boast in men."
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.600]   You notice how he says, "He catches the wise in their craftiness."
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:59.320]   Basically, what he's saying is people who are wise in their own eyes or wise in the
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:03.960]   eyes of the world, they use their wisdom for craftiness.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.160]   For what purpose?
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.160]   For self-gain.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.160]   For self-gain.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:14.080]   They use their wisdom, they use their wealth, they use their influence to further their
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:21.960]   cause, to further their rebellion, self-centeredness, self-gratification, self-glorification.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:29.560]   And what Paul is saying is, "Do you not know that God called you because you were weak?"
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.840]   The first group of people that he called into the church and established the church is because
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.920]   you had nothing.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.880]   It's because you were not wise.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.420]   You were the untouchables.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.920]   You were not the Lingayats.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.800]   The first group of people that came was to demonstrate the power of the cross and not
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   you.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   And that's exactly what Paul says.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.120]   "I wasn't chosen because I wasn't…
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.640]   I was a good apostle material."
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.040]   He said, "I was the worst of sinners."
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:00.640]   In order that your faith will not rest on man's wisdom but on God's power.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:05.800]   So let no one boast in men, for all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.000]   or the world or life or death or the present or the future.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.480]   All are yours and you are Christ and Christ is God.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:23.600]   He says, "The root cause of division and hatred in the church is the same thing, the
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:28.040]   same principles that we lived by before we became a Christian and we're just applying
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:31.400]   it in the church."
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.040]   You can do godly things.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.040]   You can even preach on the pulpit.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.040]   You can lead small groups.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:48.240]   But at the core of our motivation is self-glorification, self-preservation, and self-gratification.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:53.520]   In Jeremiah 45, 5, it says, "And do you seek great things for yourself?
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.520]   Seek them not.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:59.040]   For behold, I am bringing disaster upon all flesh, declares the Lord, but I will give
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:04.600]   you your life as a prize of war in all places to which you may go."
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.320]   This agape love is at the core.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.640]   It is a rebellion against rebellion.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.040]   Let me say that again.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:21.240]   This agape love that he commands us to practice, that identifies us as Christians, is a rebellion
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.500]   against our rebellion.
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.880]   It fights against selfishness.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:31.480]   It challenges us against our pride.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.400]   It calls us out of our worldliness.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:40.360]   It is the only healing power of brokenness.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:45.880]   It heals even the bad memories of our past.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:52.120]   The only remedy to a broken relationship is not justice.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.920]   You have two people who are declaring justice.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.840]   You have done this, and I have done this.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:02.400]   But one person's idea of fair is not the same as the other person's idea of fair.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:12.960]   Two people who are having difficulties, who have conflict, cannot be reconciled by justice.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.840]   We can't even agree what is right and what is wrong.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:20.080]   We can't agree on what is fair.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:27.880]   The only way that the world can be reconciled is by agape love.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.840]   The only way husbands and wives can be reconciled is by agape love.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.920]   The only way that relationships can be reconciled is by agape love.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:42.360]   When we talk about Christ and what He has done, a typical question that people come
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:47.080]   up with is, "I can't believe that your God destroyed the world in this flood."
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.600]   They have a hard time understanding that.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.880]   When you see it from a biblical perspective, from a real perspective, everybody should
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.120]   be able to understand that.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.120]   Everybody.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.720]   Because we all practice justice.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.000]   The world practices justice.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.080]   If somebody commits a crime and they don't get punished, you see people out on the streets
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.160]   with picket signs.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.560]   "Unjust!
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.120]   Unjust!"
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.440]   No justice, no peace.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.800]   You see people marching, demanding justice.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:23.560]   If you see a crime taking place, do we understand what happened?
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.960]   Because if you see it from God's perspective, we can understand why He did that.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:32.200]   He created these human beings to worship and they're rebelling against Him.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.400]   Why wouldn't He crush them?
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.400]   Who are they?
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:40.520]   When was the last time you had a bunch of ants coming into your home and out of annoyance
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.440]   you crushed them and then you couldn't sleep at night because you were worried about the
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.800]   ants' family and their children, their genealogy.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.800]   It's like, "Oh my gosh, I can't believe what I did.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:53.040]   I should have shown mercy."
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.160]   It's even comical to even think about that.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.880]   We didn't create these ants.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.960]   I don't have sovereignty over these ants.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.440]   I just did it because I could.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.560]   Because this is my house.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:14.240]   So the distance between us and God is far greater than the distance between me and these
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.240]   ants.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:19.160]   But I never think twice about crushing them.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:23.520]   And the only sin that they've committed was they annoyed me.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.920]   I don't want them near my food.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.480]   We never think about it.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:35.400]   So if you think from God's perspective, the flood should make a lot of sense.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.960]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.400]   But it's hard to understand.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:44.240]   And what does not exist in this world is the cross.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:56.120]   Why would a holy God empty himself and take on human form all to save rebellious sinners?
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.120]   That we do not see in this world.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.960]   There's nothing that we can relate to to say, "Ah, that's what God's love is like."
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.880]   It is completely foreign.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.560]   There is no example.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.000]   In fact, it is not even valued.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.560]   What he did on the cross is at the core of redemption.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:23.960]   It fights against our natural instinct for self-preservation.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.400]   Because your works is not included.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.580]   It fights against self-gratification because we die to ourselves.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:39.140]   It fights against self-glorification because the gospel humbles us at the core.
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:44.220]   God-paid love is at the core of redemption.
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:49.300]   Not just for justification, but for sanctification.
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:56.220]   The only hope to reverse the curse of mankind is the love that he gave us, unconditional,
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.340]   and for us to practice that as well.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.340]   Let's pray.
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:15.740]   Again, as our worship team comes, let's take some time to reflect and ask the Lord to judge
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:19.660]   the thoughts and intentions of our heart with the word of God that you've heard.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.780]   To really come to the Lord in prayer.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:29.660]   That if you have grudges in your heart, divisions, hurtful things, maybe even within your own
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:34.220]   home, to ask the Lord to search your heart.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:39.180]   See if there's any hurtful ways in us that the aroma of Christ may be rich in our lives.
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.900]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
