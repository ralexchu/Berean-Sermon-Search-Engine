[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   Hello, my name is Angela Song and this is my testimony.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.800]   At the age of six, a cyst on my liver determined my life or death.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.320]   My mom shared about her father in heaven and his son Jesus Christ who died for my sins.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.240]   The day I was discharged from the hospital was Easter Sunday and was celebrated that
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.600]   day as starting new life that God conquered my death.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.980]   But the surgery scar on my abdomen meant strict dietary guidelines, meaning there were certain
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.560]   food or snacks like candy that I was not allowed to consume.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.400]   Lack of certain snacks and food led to stealing which then escalated to other things throughout
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.600]   the years.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.080]   From elementary to high school, I was aware of my wrongful actions but I was far from
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.400]   repentance.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.040]   Over the years, I became so consumed with stealing from friends, families, Old Navy,
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.280]   a place that used to exist called Mervin's, Albertsons, and Target, calling this hobby
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.560]   my job.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.320]   Not only was I deliberately committing sin, there was so much more rooted underneath.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.480]   My stealing even continued within the church which caused strife among the elders and when
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.960]   being confronted rather than being honest about my wrongdoings, I chose to lie instead.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.760]   Shortly after, my parents who owned a small business went bankrupt which led me to feel
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.680]   guilty of my wrongdoings.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.400]   Only out of fear of man, I questioned if my parents' bankruptcy was because of my actions.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.120]   But I still refused to confess and repent.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.560]   With a new start and a new state, I was asked a common question for a new person, "So
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.560]   why did you and your family move?"
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.760]   To avoid telling the truth, I lied and kept distance from people.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.600]   Ultimately, this led to loneliness which then led to dark thoughts.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.200]   But by the grace of God who has shown mercy in my time of trouble, the Holy Spirit revealed
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.040]   to me that loneliness is God's way to intervene and say, "Hey, I am here.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.040]   Talk to me."
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.640]   During that time of devotion, I confessed of my sin of stealing and asked for repentance.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.200]   It was sophomore year in college where there was a change in my mind and in my heart of
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.640]   completely cutting ties with stealing.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.760]   The Holy Spirit also revealed to me through many Sunday sermons of my other deeply rooted
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.080]   sins of pride, gluttony, envy, and greed which outcomes my anger and fear.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.200]   God also revealed my idolization in the opinions of others and how much I feared man than fearing
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.140]   God the creator.
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.280]   In all my wrongdoings, God continues to keep his promise of loving me by sacrificing his
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.560]   son Jesus Christ to pay the penalty of my sins.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.480]   Understanding this and clinging onto it became a healing process in my sanctification journey.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.240]   There is joy and freedom from the torment of sin and that I am reminded that I have
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.480]   been given grace when I do not deserve it.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.160]   It was freely given to me.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.040]   In Hebrews 11, one says this, "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.240]   of things not seen."
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.120]   I will trust and cling onto his word to practice obedience while at the same time having faith
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.480]   in the work of Jesus Christ in order to seek God's kingdom.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.480]   Thank you.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.480]   [applause]
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.480]   [pause]
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:23.480]   [pause]
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   [applause]
