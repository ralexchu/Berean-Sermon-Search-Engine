[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.300]   Heavenly Father, we are gathered here together to continue to study your word. I pray for
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.660]   insights, Lord God, and diligence. Help us to recognize the importance of knowing your
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.560]   word that we do not just coast along from week to week, and not simply to depend on
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.240]   others, but learning how to come to your word, Lord God, and to hear from you directly. We
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.400]   pray for your grace, we pray for your Holy Spirit to lead and guide us. In Jesus' name
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.480]   we pray, amen. Alright, so as you probably have noticed that there is a major transition
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:50.440]   that takes place between chapter 2 and chapter 3. Can somebody tell me what that is? We mentioned
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:59.840]   it in the overview study. What is the transition that took place between chapter 2 and chapter
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:18.720]   3? Take a guess from what you've seen. Or maybe you remember from our introduction study.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.320]   Chapter entering into the imperatives. So chapter 1 and 2 predominantly was indicative,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.320]   basically describing what happened, who he is, who we are in light of that. So if you
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.360]   look at chapter 3 and 4, it's imperatives of therefore you should do this, therefore
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.000]   this is what you ought to do. So predominant, it doesn't mean every single verse is like
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.400]   that, but it's indicative, this is why you should do what you should be doing, and this
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.760]   is what you should be doing. Right? Is that just in this book? No. Much of the New Testament
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.400]   is organized exactly in that way. Right? It begins by saying this is what has happened,
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.680]   this is what Jesus has done, this is who he is, therefore this is what you ought to do.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.120]   Okay? So that's a big transition that's taking place in chapter 3 and 4. So we've been studying
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.700]   a lot about the gospel, and then now we're going to be talking about the implications
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.640]   of the gospel. Okay? So before we jump into the text itself, I wanted to introduce a couple
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:24.520]   of study tools. Now, obviously this is not outdated, but the avenue in which you access
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.960]   this is definitely outdated. So a long time ago when I used to prepare sermons and do
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.520]   Bible study, I would have to get maybe about five or six of these reference books, and
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.400]   again, I didn't actually own them. I had to go to the library, and then I had to get all
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.120]   these, and stack it up, and get the different commentaries, and then as I'm studying, if
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.800]   I have a question, I would open this up, jot the notes down, and then open the other one
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.400]   up, and jot the notes down. All of this stuff is on either online, or how many of you have
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:06.040]   a Bible program on your computer? Not internet, but Bible program. Okay, a few of you. If
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.960]   you don't have a Bible program, I know that you can go to the internet, but it is so much
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.600]   more easier, because it just goes much faster, and there's so much more that you can access.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:30.680]   If you have about $100, and you want to invest in a material to help you study the Bible,
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.400]   there's nothing that will help you more than investing in a Bible program. Now, if you
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.760]   have questions about which Bible program, there's one I use, but that's not the most
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.720]   popular one, and then there's ones that are used by pastors, and professors, and sometimes
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.760]   it's too complicated, but there's mid-grade ones, right? Especially, how many of you use
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:59.560]   Mac? Really? How many of you use Mac? Okay, if you use Mac, Accordance is a good one that
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.760]   you could use, but I'm going to, I wanted to bring my computer, but I didn't today.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.280]   One of these days, I'm going to show you what I use, and it's very, very basic, but it saves
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.640]   me a ton of time. I wanted to introduce to you two reference books. One is Divine Complete
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:25.080]   Expository Dictionary, right? So, years ago, they put together a reference book, where
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.600]   basically with definitions of all the words, key words that are used in the Bible, and
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.140]   they put definitions on it, and it's linked to a strong number, so they have a number
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.280]   for every single word that is used in the Bible, and then if you look up that number,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.400]   they'll give you the definition of that, where that word is used, how many times it's used,
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.280]   and how they understood it, in what context, okay? So, this is the book for that, and this
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.760]   has been around for a long time, but a lot of people who study the Bible on a regular
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.160]   basis, this is what they reference, okay? So, this is one of them, the Vines Dictionary,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.800]   okay? Again, you can get one of these, and have it in your library, and carry it around
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.600]   in your backpack, and open it up, and go to do that, but if you have a Bible program,
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.360]   all you have to do is just download this onto the Bible program, right? It's like 15 bucks,
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.000]   20 bucks, and then whenever you have a question on a word, you just click it, and this will
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.200]   come up, okay? The other one, this is probably what I use on a week-to-week basis more than
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.440]   any other reference book. Every sermon, every Bible study, every time I study the Bible,
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.800]   I reference this, and basically what this is, is gives you key cross-references, okay?
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.440]   I know that most of your Bibles have something in the middle, and let's say if you have a
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.920]   really important verse, and it'll give you like one or two verses that are related to
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:56.200]   that verse, this goes through, like let's say if you were looking at John 3, 16, "For
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.520]   God so loved the world," so, you know, where in other parts of the Bible is that phrase
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.000]   used, "God and love," and it'll give you all the references where God's love is mentioned
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.520]   in the Bible. Now, do you think that would be useful? Extremely useful, right? And so,
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.160]   instead of just giving you two verses, or one or two verses for the verse, it'll break
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:25.680]   down every phrase, every thought, and it'll list down all the verses, okay? It's not 100%
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.440]   complete, but it's thorough enough where if you are seriously studying the Bible, this
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:37.120]   is going to help you tremendously, okay? So, this, again, if you bought this and you carry
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.560]   this around, imagine carrying this thing around every time you study the Bible, but if you
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.560]   have a good Bible program, all you have to do is purchase this and download it, okay?
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:52.400]   So basically, it's half the cost of annual Disneyland Pass, so if you invest in this,
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.980]   right, in the Bible program, you can easily download it and have eternal value instead
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.920]   of earthly things, okay? So, seek eternal things instead of the earthly things, all
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:12.600]   right? So, this is the Vines, this is the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, Treasury
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:22.080]   of Scripture Knowledge, okay? Revise and expand it. I didn't know, but Esther told me that
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.560]   she was listening to MacArthur, and MacArthur said that this is one reference book that
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:33.520]   he uses more than any other reference book, okay? If that helps. I don't care what Pastor
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:41.320]   Peter says, okay? But John McIler said it, so, okay? All right, so again, this would
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.040]   be tremendously helpful. If you're digging and you really want to study the Bible, this
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:54.160]   and this is highly recommended. It'll take your Bible study to another level, okay? I'm
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.080]   just going to leave it up here. If you want to, like, jot it down or take a picture of
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:07.040]   it, okay, for reference, I'll leave it up here. Okay. All right, so let's look at the
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:13.320]   text. Remember, the very first thing that we do every week is to, is for sentence structure
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:21.560]   outline, right? If you look at it, what are the key words or phrases or ideas that are
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:34.400]   repeated in this text? Okay, things above. I actually highlighted it for you. I highlighted
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:43.040]   it and I was going to de-highlight it and I forgot, okay? Christ. How'd you get that?
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:48.280]   All right, so Christ is the ongoing theme. Obviously, the whole New Testament, Christ
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:56.760]   is the ongoing theme, but in this verse, in these verses, right, the outline, raised with
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:07.520]   Christ, right, to seek where Christ is, we are hidden with Christ, Christ is our life,
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:14.480]   we will be revealed with Christ, right? So the whole theme or the outline of these four
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:21.960]   verses is about our relationship with Christ and how that determines our life, okay? So
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.480]   the outline of what we're looking at today is, verse one, we are raised with Christ,
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:39.120]   right? Two, seek where Christ is. Three, we are hidden with Christ. Four, our life is
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.320]   in Christ. Five, we are, we will be revealed with Christ. Okay, so if I was to give a sermon,
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:51.760]   it'd be a five-point sermon, right, on this. So that's kind of the outline of how we're
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.800]   going to follow, and the reason why I didn't, all I did was give you the verses, because
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.760]   I want you to put the notes directly into the verses. Instead of, instead of putting
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.960]   the notes on the side, I want you to see where it's coming from. Make circles and then draw
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.480]   lines and then say, this is where the insights are coming from, okay? So that when you're
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:14.840]   studying the Bible, you would do the same thing, okay? All right, so, like I said, the
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:23.880]   outline is our relation to Christ and how does that affect what we do. So one is, if
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:29.480]   you have been raised with Christ, well, even before we get there, he says, therefore, therefore
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.280]   is obviously connecting us to the previous verse. And what was the main theme of the
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:42.040]   previous passage in chapter two? What was he speaking against? Legalism, right? They
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:49.240]   were all holding on to the Judaistic ways and he says that all of these things have
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:56.800]   no value in what? Taming the flesh, right? So basically he says, don't do this. That's
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.080]   how he ended chapter two. And then he says, but do this. So considering that none of these
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.880]   things that you're doing, don't touch, don't eat, don't do this, they have no value in
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.560]   absolute, in changing who you are, right? Therefore, do this. And then so basically
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.840]   what he's saying, if you connect what he is saying, these things don't have any power
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.680]   over you. So therefore, what? Right? The only power that you're going to have is when you're
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:29.440]   connected to Christ. You being self-disciplined and saying, I'm not going to do this, I'm
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.600]   not going to go here, in and of itself, you just, you could be as disciplined as possible,
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.760]   but there's no interchange going on. You just happen to be a disciplined person. You just
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.520]   happen to be a smart person. You just happen to like to study the Bible. In and of itself,
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.780]   there's no transformation going on. True transformation happens when we are connected to Christ, right?
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:54.040]   And that's what he's basically saying in chapter three. And he leads us, and that's basically
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.360]   the outline. One of the questions that came in is why does he say he was raised with Christ,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.960]   right? Instead of died with Christ. Because the previous chapter, right, mentions it over
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.980]   and over again that we were crucified with Christ. So you have to see it in the context
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.400]   of the whole letter. So one of the things that I caution you, even though we're only
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:19.000]   studying section at a time, always, always reread what you read before. Okay? Because
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.160]   you have to understand it in context. If you don't understand the context, you're going
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.920]   to draw out things that he's not talking about. Right? So over and over again, what is the
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:34.840]   most important thing in interpretation? Context, context, context. So even though we're only
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:41.040]   starting four verses, you have to read how did he get to chapter three, right? Because
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.760]   therefore connects us to everything that he's been saying up to this point. So he says,
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.160]   if you have been raised with Christ, right? Another question came in is why did he say
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:57.960]   if, not since? Part of the reason why he says if is because he's challenging this church
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:03.400]   that keeps drifting. Right? Because the early church kept on having problems and the whole
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:08.440]   book of Hebrews about that. People are drifting back to what they know. Self-righteousness.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:14.080]   Right? So basically he's challenging them. If you've been raised with Christ, if you're
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:21.800]   truly united with Christ, there's no power in that. Right? You need to change your mindset
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:27.600]   and seek the things that are above. So he says, if you've been raised with Christ, right?
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.840]   And the imperative here is keep seeking the things that are above. Right? If you've been
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:40.020]   united with Christ. Now, what does it mean to be raised with Christ? Right? We talked
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.760]   about that in baptism. When you're baptized, you're united with Christ in his death. And
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:51.360]   it's clear what it means to be united with his death. Our old self is dead. Whatever
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:57.160]   ambition that you had, if you had a plan of life and you met Christ, all of that is to
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.080]   be crucified with Christ. And any part of that that we do not crucify is going to continue
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:08.560]   to cause problems in your life. Right? Any part of your life that you resist the surrender
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.740]   to God will over and over and over again in your life is going to be a source of headache
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:20.880]   and problem. Right? Because God is not going to ever, if you are his child, God is not
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.780]   going to ever say, you know what? That part of your life, since you're so stubborn, I'm
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:32.080]   just going to let it go. Right? I'm just going to let it go. So that part you can have independence
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.160]   and you can do whatever you want, but just give me this. He's king. The whole reason
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:46.160]   why the world is under sin and judgment is because of this rebellion. So there's no point
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.600]   in our Christian life in human history where God's going to just tolerate that because
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.240]   remember God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. So if he didn't tolerate the
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.440]   old Testament, he's not going to tolerate the new Testament. So part of what it means
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.760]   before we get, we understand being raised with Christ, that we are crucified with him.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:08.200]   Right? Then what does it mean to be raised with Christ? Right? And how does that relate
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:14.640]   to, how does that relate to what he said in chapter two? Chapter two says, not doing this
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.640]   and not touching this and not eating this. They in and of itself has no power to change
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:24.360]   you. Right? Therefore, if you've been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:30.600]   So what does he mean to be raised with Christ? Since there's no power in this, therefore
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.360]   if you've been raised with Christ, seek the things above. Right? If you take the raised
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:41.080]   with Christ out, right? You understand what I'm saying? If you take the raised with Christ
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:50.240]   part out and he says, seek the things that are above. Couldn't that easily be another
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:56.480]   religious thing that they're doing? You understand what I'm saying? Because they're saying, I'm
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.080]   not going to do this. I'm not going to eat this. And they want to be righteous and they
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.040]   want to, they want to, you know, be righteous by doing things and not doing things. So when
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.880]   he says seek the things above, wouldn't that automatically cause us to say, okay, what
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:17.040]   should we do? What should we not do? Right? So the key to this passage is with Christ.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.320]   Since therefore that in and of itself has no power, if you've been raised with Christ,
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:26.820]   seek the things that are above. So the big difference is with Christ. Right? Raised with
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.840]   Christ. So being raised with Christ isn't simply saying like, oh, I was resurrected
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.800]   and you know, now I'm going to try to try my best to live a life that's worthy of God.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.240]   Something happens when we are crucified and raised with Christ that you could not do by
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:49.040]   your own strength. Right? He says that in Ephesians chapter 1, 19 to 20, and what is
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.040]   the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe these are in accordance with
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.360]   the workings of the strength of his might, which he brought about in Christ when he raised
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:03.280]   him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places. So he said there
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.520]   was tremendous power that lifted Christ up, but when he was lifted and we are lifted with
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:17.080]   him, what is he saying? That same power is in us. Right? So he's not just talking about
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:22.960]   just having your mind and heart, just like thinking about Jesus. Right? What we did not
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.480]   have the ability to do before we were united to Christ, he's saying now you have that power.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.120]   That same power that resurrected Christ is the same power that you and I have access
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:38.720]   to. Does that make sense? Because without that union with Christ and his death and resurrection,
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:47.400]   it just becomes another form of legalism. Right? And isn't that exactly how it feels?
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.720]   If you're trying really hard to do quiet time and not to do bad things and not to sin and
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.160]   you don't have affection for Christ and you don't feel this union with Christ, doesn't
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:04.440]   it just feel like you're doing more stuff? Right? What's the difference? What's the difference
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.480]   between the Pharisees trying to keep the Sabbath holy versus Christians trying to do quiet
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:17.920]   time? What's the difference? The key is with Christ. Right? Resurrected with Christ. Right?
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:23.440]   So the moment we drift away from Christ, you have no power. The only power that you and
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:30.840]   I have is the same power that the Pharisees had. To be disciplined. Right? To say the
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:36.360]   right things, to do the right things. But there's no interchange going on. So he says,
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:41.180]   "Seek." Right? If you've been raised with Christ, with the power he's given you, seek
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:47.260]   the things that are above. Right? And that's in Matthew 7, 7, "Ask and it will be given
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:54.200]   to you. Seek and you will find and knock and it will be opened to you." So if you've been
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.280]   resurrected with Christ and you have this union with Christ and you just sit there and
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:10.100]   do nothing, what happens? If you have this resurrected power that justified your sins
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.760]   and now you're united with Christ in his death and resurrection and you sit there and do
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:25.400]   nothing, what happens? Nothing. Nothing happens. Right? Just because your car is filled with
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:32.560]   gas, if you don't go there and drive that car, it's useless. Right? So God has given
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.040]   us in our union with Christ in his death and resurrection, he has given us the power that
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.360]   we didn't have before. So he said, "If you have that, if you've been resurrected with
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:50.160]   Christ, seek the things that are above." Right? Jeremiah 29, 13. "Seek, seek me and you will
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:59.760]   find me if you seek me with," what? "All your heart." Right? He has given, given us, right,
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:05.520]   the resources. And what is the primary resource that we have that they didn't have, that the
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:13.480]   Jews didn't have, that we have now? Yes. Okay. The Holy Spirit. There is no Christian who
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:19.520]   does not have the Holy Spirit. Right? There's not a single Christian, if you are a genuine
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.880]   Christian, if you've been raised with Christ, who does not have the Holy Spirit. And that's
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.080]   why he says, "If you've been raised with Christ, if you're united with him in his death and
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.600]   resurrection, with that, seek." Right? "Seek the things that are above." John 6, 26, 27.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:37.120]   "Jesus answered them and said, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.160]   saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled." In other words, they're
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.000]   not seeking Christ. They're thinking the gift that Christ was going to give. They weren't
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.200]   seeking him. He corrects them, "Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.640]   which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on him, the Father,
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:21:01.080]   God has set his seal." Right? God has given them, right, maybe not them, but God has given
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.960]   us the Holy Spirit, and we're using the Holy Spirit for what purpose? Right? If we use
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.760]   the Holy Spirit to seek earthly things, what's going to happen? We're going to be frustrated.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:18.000]   Right? So, look at the content of our prayer. How much of the content of your prayer is
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.960]   for a better job? How much of the content of your prayer is for health? How much of
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:31.440]   the content of your prayer is for certain things to work out? Right? Now, does it mean
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:37.600]   that God doesn't want us to pray for none of that? But how much of our pursuit is really
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:45.360]   earthly things in Jesus' name? How much of our pleading and seeking and praying is about
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:51.640]   things that have eternal value for lost souls, for his glory, right, building up of the church?
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.440]   Right? So, he says, "If the Holy Spirit's been given to us, the purpose of the Holy
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:03.120]   Spirit is for us to have the power to seek eternal things, to bring us to God." Right?
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.440]   Which I mentioned before, when the Holy Spirit is groaning, what do you think it's groaning
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:14.280]   for? It's not groaning for us to have, you know, the best investments and have nice retirement
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:19.160]   and get a better job or, you know, have better health. And again, none of these things are
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:25.040]   things that God says you shouldn't pray. You should pray, right? But how much of it is
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.240]   that and how much of it is really seeking the things that are above? So, if you've been
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.520]   raised with Christ, seek the things that are above. Number two, where Christ is seated
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:39.480]   at the right hand of God. Right? Set your mind to the things that are above because
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:46.800]   that's where Christ is. We don't think about heaven because if you go to heaven, you're
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.240]   going to get the things that you didn't get here. Right? You can get a mansion here, so
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:57.840]   we're going to get a mansion there. Right? If you're short, you get to be tall. Right?
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:05.880]   Whatever it is that your desire is, it's not go to heaven and all your, you know, fleshly
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.200]   desires will be fulfilled. And that's what the world thinks heaven is. Right? He says
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.760]   to seek the things that are above because why? Because that's where Christ is. So, if
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.440]   you're not united with Christ, a non-Christian cannot desire heaven. The heaven he desires
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.560]   is a heaven that he created in his own mind. It is not a heaven that we know of scripture.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:32.720]   Right? A non-Christian would never desire heaven. Not the heaven of the Bible because
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.800]   the primary reason heaven is heaven is because this is where Christ is. Right? So, if you've
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.960]   been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.080]   hand. Set your mind on the things that are above. So, when he says set your mind on the
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:56.520]   things that are above, typically we think of mind as what? Our intellect. Right? That's
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.680]   not how the Bible uses it. In that culture, again, this is why the context is so important.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:10.240]   This is why when you get one of these, right? For the low cost of $15.95. Right? If you
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:16.840]   get one of these and you look up that word mind, it will give you, like, your intellect
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:23.760]   is part of it. But the mind is used in the Bible to refer to the mind, affection, and
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:29.160]   the will. Right? I mentioned many times in sermons and Bible study, when the Bible talks
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:36.960]   about heart, we usually primarily use it to describe what? Emotion. Remember? Those of
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.600]   you guys who pay attention during sermons. Right? When the Bible talks about heart, what
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:54.760]   is that in reference to? It's not just emotions. Huh? Volition. Yeah, part of it. Okay, that's
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:59.640]   part of it. Basically, when the Bible talks about heart, it's in reference to your whole
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:06.480]   being. All of you. It's equivalent to for us to saying, like, put your soul into it.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:11.400]   Right? The essence of who you are. So it's not just limited to heart. So volition, it's
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:18.160]   obviously is included in that. So in the Bible, it's kind of reversed. Because when he says
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:25.600]   mind, it encompasses the idea of affection. And not just intellect. Right? So when you
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:32.400]   understand that, think about Romans chapter 12 too. Do not be conformed to this world,
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:38.480]   but be transformed by what? Reading of your mind. So if you understand the word mind,
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:46.240]   in our context, you only think that God is trying to get you to think differently. Right?
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:52.520]   Not to conform to this world, but to change your thinking. That is not how the word mind
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:57.320]   is understood. The word mind there is not just talking about thinking, but your affection
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:04.480]   and your will. All of that is included in Romans chapter 12. So you can have good thinking
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:13.720]   and poor affection and still be like the world. Right? So when God is calling us to be transformed,
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.040]   he's not only calling us to be transformed in the way that we think. He's causing us
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:26.080]   to transform in the things that we have affection for. Right? So that's why he says, if you've
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.520]   been raised to Christ, seek the things that are above. Because this is where Christ is,
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.520]   at the right hand of God. Set your mind, your affection, your will, on the things that are
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:41.400]   above and not on the things that are on earth. Okay? To your whole being. He's not just thinking
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.320]   about like, hey, just memorize scripture. Why do you memorize scripture? If memorization
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:53.520]   of scripture is just keeping it in your head, what will you do with that? Right? You'll
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:27:00.760]   probably catch me when I quote it wrong. Right? When somebody else misquotes it, it's like,
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:06.480]   that's not the right way to say that. Right? The purpose of Bible memorization is for the
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:12.280]   purpose of what? Meditating. Right? Allow the word of God in your mind to meditate on
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.960]   it. Right? So that you would not turn from it to the left or to the right. That's the
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:23.600]   purpose of Bible memorization. It's not just so that your mind would be fresh. Right? So
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:30.400]   thirdly, for you have died and your life is now hidden with Christ. You notice here that
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:36.240]   he doesn't say hidden in Christ. What is the difference between being hidden in Christ
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:46.840]   and hidden with Christ? Because it's sometimes when you see prepositions or, or, you know,
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:55.480]   certain, certain words, it's not necessarily in the Greek, but this is deliberate. He says
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:01.920]   it is, we are not hidden in Christ, but hidden with Christ. So what do you think the difference
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:16.920]   with the, the meaning between the two? Okay. Active participation. When you say hidden
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:29.640]   in Christ, with Christ. Okay. Okay. Active and inactive participation. What do you think
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:41.920]   when you say we are hidden in Christ? Is Christ hidden? When you say you're hidden in Christ,
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:49.360]   is Christ hidden? Christ is not hidden. Right? Christ is being exalted and you are in Christ.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:56.000]   Right? So Christ is being exalted, you stand behind Christ. Right? But that's not what
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.480]   he says. He says you are hidden with Christ. So when he says you are hidden with Christ,
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:12.000]   is Christ hidden too? Christ is hidden too. You see the difference between in and with?
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:33.120]   Right? So what does he mean that you are hidden with Christ? What does that mean? Huh? Something
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:46.960]   died? I didn't hear the rest. Huh? We died with him. Okay. Who is Christ hidden to? Not
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:55.360]   to us. Right? Those who are perishing. Right? The Bible says the God of this age has blinded
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.160]   the minds of the unbelievers so that they do not see the glory of the gospel of Jesus
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:06.000]   Christ. It is foolishness to them. Right? So why would he say that? Don't seek the things
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.120]   that are above. Seek where Christ is. Where is Christ? He doesn't, again, of course Christ
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:17.060]   is omnipresent, the Lord is with you to the end of the age, but here he says seek the
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:23.440]   things that are above because that's where he is. So as he is hidden, as he is not here,
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:35.280]   you along with him, right, are hidden with Christ. I think the importance of that, of
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:43.080]   the hidden with and in is, he's talking about a earthly ambition. Earthly ambition to seek
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:49.640]   the things that are earthly. Right? But Christ, even Christ is hidden. Meaning, Jesus says
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.840]   they're not going to know you because they didn't know me. Right? They're not going to
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:31:00.600]   honor you because they didn't honor me. And so if you seek honor and glory, right, while
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:06.080]   you are united with Christ, you're going the opposite direction. You're not with Christ.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:14.820]   If you are with Christ, you're not going to be glorified by people who don't glorify Christ.
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:21.600]   If people say, "I hate Jesus, but I love you." Right? I think Jesus is a monster, but you're
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:29.720]   a good person. Right? There's something that went wrong with your life. Right? Either you're
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:35.880]   not truly united with Christ, but you live in a compromised life. So basically he's saying,
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:40.680]   if you seek the things that are on earth and not to seek where God is, Christ, he himself
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:46.280]   is hidden in this world. He is not honored. Right? So your life, our life is hidden with
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:51.320]   Christ as Christ is hidden to those who are perishing. So if you try to be glorified and
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.960]   become somebody in this world outside of Christ, right, you're going the opposite direction.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:02.520]   How can you be glorified beyond your master? How can you be loved by people who hate our
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:11.160]   master? Right? If I'm married to Esther and somebody just cannot stand her, it's probably
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.720]   the other way. Right? If I'm married with her and somebody cannot stand me and they
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:20.520]   can't stand to be in my presence, they're not going to be able to be with her either.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:29.000]   Right? So if we're truly united with Christ, and that's why he says, "If you died with
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.640]   him, you have been hidden with Christ." Right? In other words, we are crucified with Christ.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:42.880]   We're hidden with Christ. Number four, so when Christ, who is your life, not life in
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:50.400]   this world, but life that is found in Christ, when he appears, what's going to happen? You
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:57.080]   will also appear with him in glory. In other words, the glory that you seek in this world,
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:04.400]   you will only see that when he is glorified, because we're united with him. When he is
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:12.120]   loved, you will be loved. When he is honored, you will be honored. Does that make sense?
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.400]   That's how closely united we are with Christ. We are united with him in his death, united
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:21.320]   with his resurrected life, we have become one. Right? In essence, the Holy Spirit is
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:27.000]   in us. The same reason why they hate Jesus will be the same reason why they would hate
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:34.600]   us. So trying to be a cool Christian, right, cool in the eyes of the world, but to be holy
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:40.400]   in the eyes of God is an oxymoron. Right? Whatever they hate about Jesus, they will
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:50.240]   hate about us. What do they love about Jesus, they will love us for. You understand what
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:58.600]   he is saying? So this seeking of this world, right, desiring glory in this world, to be
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:06.560]   somebody in this world, goes contrary to be united with Christ. Right? He said when Christ,
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:13.040]   who is your life, is revealed. If you have truly been resurrected with Christ, your life
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:21.280]   is now in Christ. He is your life. Right? Not whatever it is that we get attracted to,
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:27.080]   whatever it is that we fantasize about having one day or doing one day. Right? He said that's
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:33.760]   not where life is. And if you are a Christian, either you embrace that and you have wisdom
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:40.680]   and you live toward that, or if you resist that, right, if you're a child of God, you're
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:46.880]   going to find at the end of that just frustration, heartache, because God is going to discipline
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:54.720]   you. If you're a child of God, God will discipline you because he's trying to give you himself,
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:01.160]   and you're running the opposite direction. Right? If you're not a child of God, running
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:09.280]   toward Christ would only frustrate you, because that's not where your life is. Right? So why
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:17.040]   do we come? There's only two reasons why people would come to church and sit through what
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:26.760]   seemingly will seem like a boring Bible study. I remember somebody I met a couple years ago,
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:31.600]   and they found out that we were going through Isaiah, and he listened to some of the lectures
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.800]   in Isaiah, and I remember I sat down with him, and the first thing he asked me is like,
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   "Do people come to this?" That's what he said. Like, "They actually come to this?" And I
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:46.920]   said, "Come, come, take a look." Right? He said, "Yeah, I mean, a lot of people are not
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.080]   going to be interested in that. They're going to come, and then just because the length
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.520]   of the sermon, or it's a little bit difficult, you know, say, 'Oh, these people take the
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:01.340]   Bible too seriously,' and that's enough to drive people away." But if you've tasted Christ
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:07.720]   in the Scripture, you can't do anything else. Right? If your eyes have been opened, nothing
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:16.240]   compares. So either you're willing to go through this boring lecture, right, because you just
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:21.200]   love your friends. Right? Football is your life, and this is the only place you can play
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:30.480]   football. Right? Just community, just a place where you belong. That's a huge pool. Right?
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.140]   That's where your friend is. That's where your community is. And a lot of people jump
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.620]   through the hoops and do things that they don't believe just to have a community that
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:43.180]   they belong to. Either you're coming to the church for that reason, which a lot of people
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:49.660]   do, or you're coming to Christ because you've tasted the goodness of God and nothing can
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:55.980]   replace it. Right? It's one or the other. And so he's saying, "When Christ, who is your
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:03.020]   life, if Christ is your life, don't try to seek life here, because life is not here."
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.780]   Right? That's the whole reason why our sins were justified. That's the whole reason why
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:13.540]   we want to study the Bible. Right? There's nothing I am saying that's so riveting because
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:19.500]   it's coming out of my mouth. It's because you've tasted, you've tasted the goodness
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:27.100]   of God and you want more. Right? Finally, he says, "Then when he appears, you also will
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:35.260]   be revealed with him in glory." Right? So for now, right, he's not saying like just
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:40.620]   suppress everything. He says, "No." You're pursuing life. Like the world is pursuing
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:47.460]   life in places where life is not found. But if you found life in Christ, right, right
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:52.860]   now we're hidden to the rest of this world. So don't try to be glorified. Don't try to
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:57.580]   get attention. Don't try to be honored. Don't try because this is not our home. When Christ
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:03.260]   comes and he is glorified, right, and he is exalted, he is worshipped, he said, "We will
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:09.260]   be glorified with him." Right? Everything that this world tempts us with, everything
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:14.400]   that we think like, "Oh man, I would just rather have it now." Right? All of that stuff.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.380]   He says, "Don't seek the earthly things. Seek things that are above when he comes."
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:24.080]   Philippians 3, 20 to 21. "For our citizenship is in heaven from which also we eagerly wait
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.920]   for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform the body of our humble state into
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:33.900]   conformity with the body of his glory by the exertion of the power that he has even to
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:39.880]   subject all things to himself." Right? We will be transformed. Whatever you don't like
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:45.180]   about your body, it's going to be transformed. Right? Second Thessalonians 1, 10 through
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:50.020]   12. "When he comes to be glorified in his saints on that day and to be marveled at among
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:57.220]   all who have believed, for our testimony to you was believed." Right? So I'm talking to
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:03.960]   those of you who are here who know what I'm talking about. Even if you've drifted, right?
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:10.100]   Even if your heart feels like it's become callous for a while, if you've tasted the
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:17.120]   goodness of God, even if it was a while back, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Right?
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:25.560]   You know exactly what I'm talking about. One day he's going to come. And what you've tasted
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:33.180]   was just a little. Right? He tasted just enough so that you would keep coming to him. Right?
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:38.940]   You've seen just enough to know that that's what you want. Right? That's the difference
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:44.000]   between a Christian and a non-Christian. A non-Christian will jump through the hoops
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.880]   to belong in a church. But a genuine Christian who's tasted the goodness of God will never
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:56.880]   be satisfied unless he is seeking the Lord. Right? That's why we're here. And that's why
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.440]   Paul is saying this external thing of like, "I'm going to be disciplined. I'm going to
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:04.520]   do this," in and of itself doesn't have any power to transform us until we are united
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:09.760]   with Christ. United with Christ in his resurrection. Right? We understand that we are hidden with
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:14.160]   Christ. We understand that he is our life. And then we are longing for him to come so
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.660]   that we may find his true life in him. Until there is this union with Christ, all other
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:38.820]   things is just legalism. Right? Okay. So the questions are in the bottom. I forgot where
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:46.580]   the questions are. Okay. Well, I don't have it. Can you just put up the questions? Okay.
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:55.740]   Let me pray first and then I'll let you guys go get into your groups. Heavenly Father,
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:01.820]   I pray for your blessing upon our small group. And I know that even in this room we have
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:06.940]   varying degrees of maturity. Some people who have been here for a long time, people who
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:12.500]   have been a Christian for decades, and some who are just entering in, just trying to figure
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:18.100]   out what it means to be a follower of Christ. I pray, Father God, that the small group times
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:25.980]   will be a blessing. And whether they feel a bit lost in the studies or excited and this
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:32.460]   is nothing new to them and they're continuing to dig and to find, I pray, Father God, that
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:38.300]   you would help us to continue to taste the goodness of Christ. That our longing, our
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:43.100]   affection, our desire, our mind, our strength, our will, all of it, Lord God, would long
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:47.980]   for Christ and Christ alone. So I pray that your Holy Spirit would lead and guide the
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:53.520]   discussions. And I pray for those who are hurting, Lord God, that they would find comfort.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:58.340]   I pray for those who are struggling, Lord, that they would find their way. I pray that
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.460]   those who are strong, that you'd open their eyes to those who are around them who are
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:07.820]   in need of them. Unite us together, Lord God, and help us to build a church that honors
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.740]   and glorifies Christ. We long to see you one day. Help us to live toward that end.
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:13.820]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:14.660]   Amen.
