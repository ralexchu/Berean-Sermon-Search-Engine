[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.320]   Please turn your Bibles over to John chapter 12.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.700]   I'll be reading John chapter 12 and as Elder Joe has read verses 12 and down, I'm going
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.160]   to be reading verses 1 through 11 as we talk about just the beginning portion of this Passion
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.160]   Week.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.240]   And we're going to look at both Saturday night leading up to Jesus' entry into Jerusalem.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.520]   So I'll be reading a section verses 1 through 11, John chapter 12.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.600]   And it says this, "Jesus therefore six days before the Passover came to Bethany where
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.040]   Lazarus was whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.760]   So they made him a supper there and Martha was serving but Lazarus was one of those reclining
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.680]   at the table with him.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.600]   Mary then took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.000]   and wiped his feet with her hair.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.560]   And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.600]   But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, was intending to betray him, said, 'Why was
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.840]   this perfume not sold for 300 denarii and given to the poor people?'"
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.800]   Now he said this not because he was concerned about the poor but because he was a thief.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.440]   And as he had the money box he used to pilfer what was put into it.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:30.120]   "Therefore Jesus said, 'Let her alone so that she may keep it for the day of my burial.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.800]   For you always have the poor with you but you do not always have me.'
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.440]   The large crowd of the Jews then learned that he was there and they came and not for Jesus'
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.680]   sake only but that they might also see Lazarus whom he raised from the dead.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.040]   But the chief priest planned to put Lazarus to death also because on account of him many
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.960]   of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus."
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.520]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.000]   Our God we want to thank you for your truth and word and particularly God we pray that
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.760]   our hearts will be filled with true gratefulness and appreciation for Christ who he is, his
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.920]   work and I ask God that from an overflow of our heart being filled with the knowledge
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.520]   of Christ, Lord we would render to you our attention, our worship, our lives.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.560]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.680]   So as we take a look at some of these events that take place, we do this each year.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.480]   Take a look at the story, we read the passages.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.480]   In many ways this season is a good memorial time of everything that's happened.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.640]   And one of the things that we want to make sure we do is not just say, "Okay, it's
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.520]   Easter, I get it, Jesus passed and was resurrected, I know the story."
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:57.240]   But continue to discover by asking what really happened, how did it go down and the altogether
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.400]   important question, why, right?
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   Why?
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.120]   Because that question oftentimes gets us to have a glimpse of both the heart of Christ
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.960]   and also the heart of the people involved and that's incredibly important for us.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.600]   Right now I just read that section about Mary.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.760]   You know there's Mary, Martha and Lazarus and they're familiar characters in the Bible,
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   right?
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.800]   But here Mary expresses in quite profound fashion her love for the Savior and we want
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.240]   to ask those questions.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.640]   What really happened, how did it go down and also why?
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.340]   And that proves to be an incredible inspiration and a conviction for us.
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.280]   Because especially in times of remembering Christ, we don't want to just simply remember
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   history.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.120]   We want to make sure that we are appreciating Christ, okay?
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.680]   So as we take a look at the example that we just read, I want to highlight just a couple
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.320]   aspects of how Mary expressed her love for the Savior.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.000]   The first, there is just an incredible amount of boldness, you know?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.040]   The way that Mary came into the scene at this, there is just this boldness in something that's
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.840]   surprising, something that's not, you know, just not expected.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.500]   I mean think about the fact that she came into the dining like everybody was reclining
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.240]   and having the meal and clearly it wasn't just Jesus.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.440]   It was Lazarus was there, the disciples were there, they're seeing it, Judas is seeing
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.160]   it, you know?
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.160]   So just imagine that.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.240]   And I mean for some, especially let's say for the ladies, right?
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.120]   If let's say you were looking for somebody, I'm just going to use Elder Joe as an example,
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.120]   right?
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.840]   You're looking for him because you want to talk to him about joining praise or you just
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.800]   want to express to him like, "You do a great job, you know?
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.040]   The worship team as a whole does an awesome job.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.600]   I want to thank you, you know?"
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.080]   So you're looking through the church, you get to an office room, you open it up and
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.480]   there's like 15 guys in there, you know?
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.480]   How do you feel?
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.360]   Like just think about how you would feel.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.760]   Immediately you feel like, "Oh, sorry."
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.880]   And then like quietly close the door.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.240]   I remember even one time there was just like three or four of us having a small group.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.760]   One of the sisters left their purse in the room, they opened the door and they're like,
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.520]   and even without saying a word, they just like slowly closed the door, you know?
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.960]   Because whenever that many people like look at you, you're just automatically very what,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.960]   self-conscious?
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.800]   You're timid, you're like, "Oh shoot, I bothered something," right?
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.920]   I mean, how many of you ladies would sit there and be like, "No, Joe, I need to tell you.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.960]   Actually, I'm going to let my hair down and I need to speak to you now," you know?
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.120]   This is what I mean when I say this is unusually bold, you know?
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.680]   She takes the scene and what's more, she makes a big scene by taking something precious and
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.560]   pouring it on the feet of Jesus.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   She makes a big scene by letting down her hair and wiping his feet.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.560]   This is an incredible bold show of her affection for the Savior, right?
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.320]   And this really does just ask a question to us, you know?
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.440]   In terms of our expressions of love and our care for Christ, our sense of that like, "Christ,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.440]   I love you."
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.640]   Truthfully speaking, there are times when seasons go by and we don't say those words
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.160]   to our Savior, right?
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.520]   Because it almost feels just like if someone, like I don't know, a girlfriend forced you,
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.520]   like, "Tell me you love me."
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.840]   It's like, "I don't want to say it in public, man," you know?
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.080]   I don't know what it is, but we're almost fearful of saying those words to our own Savior.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.720]   But here we have an example of Mary being very public and bold with her affection for
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   Christ.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.400]   What's more, I want to focus in on the perfume, okay?
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.880]   And it's just one facet of the story, but the story itself focuses on it by talking
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:59.360]   about how, verse 3, it was a pound, very costly, pure, nard, and later Judas appears like,
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.720]   "That perfume is 300 denarii," you know?
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.360]   There's already in the text an attention given to the perfume, okay?
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:14.920]   Now as we think about this story, she takes this, it says here a pound of it, you know?
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.360]   In other translations, it'll say a liter, like so.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.760]   Essentially, as I was looking at the commentaries, they're trying to gauge what the term was
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:28.080]   but just imagine like a bottle of your 20-ounce Gatorade, mostly full, not all the way, but
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.360]   mostly full, right?
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.160]   So you just get a visual picture.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.080]   And to think about this, she comes over and with oils and stuff, typically you just need
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.320]   like a dot, right?
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.880]   I remember back when I was in high school, I wore a lot of cologne, just confessing my
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.880]   sins, okay?
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.520]   And you just wear cologne to impress people, you know?
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.840]   So I remember back then, I don't know what people wear now, so I don't know, okay?
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.200]   But back then, if you just wanted to be cool around your buddies, then you wore Hugo Boss
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.800]   because it's very manly smelling cologne.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.720]   But then if you wanted to impress the ladies, then you wear that, what is it?
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.720]   Aqua Digio, you know?
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.720]   Do you guys know?
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.720]   Okay.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.600]   Anyway, so you wear the nice stuff, the one that smells all attractive and stuff, right?
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.160]   Now what I'm getting at is you wear that stuff, again, it's just really fragrant.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.840]   Now when my buddies and I, I remember like just one spray of a bottle goes a long way,
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.840]   doesn't it?
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.840]   It's like, "Shh," and then you're done.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   Oh, there's another one, Cool Water, you guys?
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   No, okay.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.000]   So anyway, you wear that stuff, one spray is enough, but then there are those guys who
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.920]   are like, "Shh, shh, shh," and then everyone's like, "Oh, dude, you're trying way too hard,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.920]   man," you know?
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.560]   It's like, "Too much, two, three sprays and you're overdoing it."
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:46.080]   Well, the reason why I bring this up is because she takes an entire bottle of pure concentrated
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.440]   fragrance and pours it on his feet and it says in the passage, the smell just fills
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.440]   the whole room.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.000]   Wow, this is unusual.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.840]   This is unusual.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:04.080]   But what I want to highlight about that is that perfume then, it's just this jar, jar
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.920]   of this perfume and it kind of goes on to say that she takes this whole thing and pours
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.080]   it out and then when Judas sees that, he gets all like upheaved about it and says, "What
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.080]   are you doing?"
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.080]   You know?
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.800]   And then he talks about the cost.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.320]   See for Mary, she took this thing that cost an incredible amount of money.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.760]   The passage itself describes how this potentially has cost about 300 denarii and then it even
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:33.480]   like gives a commentary saying this is about a year's wage of an average worker.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.160]   What's really interesting, the commentators say, I mean like average worker, so what is
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.160]   that?
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.280]   Is that like engineer salary or is that like, you know, collegiate salary?
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.040]   I don't know, which is really...
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.040]   What is that, you know?
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.320]   Well, the commentators say that when you talk about denarii, you're talking about like that
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.600]   silver coin, a pay of a soldier, right?
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.400]   So a Roman soldier who would work the entire year would save about this much then.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:04.880]   So you're thinking in our day, kind of relative corollary cost, $30,000 to $40,000 on one
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.880]   jar.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.960]   And even today, cologne is incredibly expensive.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.560]   Like a five ounce little bottle that you spray costs like what, $50, $60, right?
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.160]   Likewise, this perfume was incredibly expensive.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.920]   As a matter of fact, most people say, I mean, it sounds to me like maybe that family, Martha,
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.440]   Mary, and Lazarus, they were pretty well off.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.160]   But even then, this is excessive.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.920]   So most commentators say this is probably like an heirloom, something that's been passed
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.840]   down from their family, something that was kind of hold as a precious like a collection
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.040]   for their family.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.280]   Maybe they had a family out far who knew them.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.080]   Maybe they knew somebody who were in higher ups and they gave it as a gift and they held
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.860]   it as a treasure.
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.040]   Because this wasn't something just readily available.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.960]   This was imported.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.720]   They say that this, you know, they don't know exactly what plant it came from, but they
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.520]   have records of this pure narn, you know?
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.640]   And I'll just say it was gnarly, right?
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.000]   Anyway, this pure narn that was imported.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Okay, I know.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Sorry.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   This was imported.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.520]   They say from the mountains of northern India, you know?
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.000]   So it was rare.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.640]   It was costly.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.600]   And why then does she do it?
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.880]   Judas is all upset because he's thinking like, you just wiped it all off.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.240]   If you're going to clean, just clean with water and sell it, you know?
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.220]   Why then?
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.760]   Because the heart affection of Mary is showing.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.000]   She's expressing externally through action.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.600]   It's not voiced, but externally through action.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.480]   Jesus, you are worth it in my eyes.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:47.000]   Every drop of this precious perfume, you are worthy.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.320]   Right?
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.280]   You're of that kind of value to me.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.880]   You're that kind of treasure to me.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.040]   Where this treasure that other people are looking at, I could literally pour because
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.840]   you're that valuable to me.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.440]   And in stark contrast, right?
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:12.240]   The passage contrasts Judas to just show the value of Christ and the worthy of Christ as
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.900]   it shows Judas reveal his perspective on the Lord Savior.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.080]   When he starts asking like, "Why?
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.680]   Why wasn't this sold and given to the poor?"
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.680]   And Luke knows.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.160]   Luke's saying like, you know, and John knows, and everybody knows.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.400]   He didn't say this because he really cared for the poor.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.160]   He was always a selfish man looking for an opportunity.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.440]   He was an opportunist.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:46.040]   But even then, when he says things like, "Why didn't we do something else?"
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:52.440]   What that tells me is generally speaking, he does not see Christ as valuable as other
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.240]   worthy causes.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.520]   Right?
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:02.240]   In his mind, there are other worthy causes that supersede this act that Mary is doing.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.080]   And you know, there are lots of people even this day, whether it's social justice, whether
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.000]   it's whatever different ambitions and desires that they have, they're good.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.800]   They are worthy causes.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.240]   But in light of this, there is this teaching.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.800]   If we do not understand the value of Christ, if we do not understand the value and treasure
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.840]   of the person of Christ, then we don't understand worship.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.880]   If we don't understand worship, then we don't have a good scale of value system of anything
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.560]   else and therefore we don't understand Christianity.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.240]   We need to understand the value of our Savior.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.280]   And when Judas is sitting here saying, "Why didn't we go and do this?
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.200]   Why didn't we go and do that?"
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.080]   Judas reveals his sinful perspective.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.020]   That in stark contrast, Judas never saw Jesus worthy.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:58.320]   And we know that in a few days, Judas will betray Christ.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:04.360]   And do you remember for how many pieces of silver Judas betrayed the Lord?
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.880]   Thirty.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.480]   And what that speaks is volume.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.480]   Here Mary just poured out 300 denarii, it's pretty much equivalent.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:18.840]   300 denarii, 300 silver coins essentially, pouring it out on Jesus' feet.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:25.640]   And Judas is sitting there saying, "Man, Jesus is even worth 10% of that."
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.360]   That's the way that Judas' heart is thinking.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:37.620]   And so here we have this moment for us then, a moment of conviction as we see the heart
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:44.120]   of Mary being poured out on the Savior and her expression of love.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:51.880]   Do you currently have a hard time mustering up that kind of affection for Savior?
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.020]   You know, I talked about how we're in a season where it's like a memorial, you know?
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.800]   And so that would be a lot like an anniversary for a wedding.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.280]   But what good would it be for a husband to put together like an album, put together like
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.080]   a little history and like, "Look, we, you know, 10 years ago we met and then we had
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.520]   this and we had that and we had the history and then said, 'Okay, I'm done.'"
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.440]   What good would it be just to go and review all the details if in the anniversary He wasn't
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:24.720]   appreciating, expressing, and saying, and rededicating, recommitting, and showing, "This
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.040]   is how much I love you.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.200]   And as years go by, as I learn more, as I think and reflect and I have these years with
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.380]   you, I love you all the more."
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:40.840]   So I ask you, in terms of the affection in your heart, you know, in terms of the expressiveness
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.480]   of love even, where are you now?
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.680]   Because in this season is when we need to sit down and ask ourselves these kind of questions.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.760]   And then it is our ambition, it is the goal of every sermon, but especially in this time,
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:59.560]   to ask how can we make sure that we bear in our mind, our heart, the presence of Christ
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.260]   and we show Him how much we appreciate Him?
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.160]   How can we make sure that we don't forget?
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.640]   How shall we make sure that we especially move, are moved in our hearts with the deep
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:17.300]   sense of gratitude, "Lord, we're so thankful for who you are and what you've done."
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.380]   And that's the aim and goal.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:26.760]   So in order to do that, what I hope to do is by covering that entry of Christ into Jerusalem,
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:34.280]   I want to highlight for you now several aspects, three aspects of Christ's glory, of Christ's
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.680]   glory in this scene.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:43.440]   The first I want to say to you is this, every single thing leading up to Christ's entrance
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.240]   is Jerusalem.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:52.960]   Every single thing that happens at Jerusalem, every single thing post His sacrifice, everything
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.580]   is under the glorious sovereignty of Christ.
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.640]   And I want to show you this, okay?
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:06.920]   When you look at even the time of Jesus in that, you know, the dinner with the family
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.000]   and dinner with Lazarus, right?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.900]   What's happening is Jesus is just making His trek and His path to Jerusalem and it's just
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.220]   a dinner.
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:21.080]   And then surprising to everybody else, Mary comes in and does this expressive show of
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.720]   her love.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.440]   Now here's an interesting statement that Jesus says.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:31.560]   When Jesus rebukes Judas and says, "You leave her alone," right?
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.560]   What else does He say?
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.520]   Well, if you take a look, He says, "Leave her alone that she may keep it for the day
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.920]   of my burial."
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.920]   Burial, right?
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:46.840]   Now if you think about that carefully, on one sense, you might be like, "Wow, Jesus
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.720]   is super witty, you know?
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.000]   She did this crazy thing.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.600]   Judas was all like upheaved about it.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.200]   And so He says, "Oh, you know, this is in preparation."
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:03.900]   But I actually think, "Wow, even in this, the anointing of Christ through the love of
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.480]   this lady, Jesus is preparing.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.760]   Jesus is preparing for His own path to His own burial, right?"
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:18.680]   I mean, if you think about it, just even the way that Mary is doing everything, it is really
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.560]   the abnormal.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.800]   And my case to you is going to be even the preparation leading up to this point is all
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.240]   in the sovereignty of Christ, the glorious sovereign hand of Christ.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.880]   There's a passage in Luke chapter 18, verse 31 through 33.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.760]   Please turn with me there.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.120]   We're going to, because of the parallel Gospels and stuff, we're going to look at different
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.120]   passages.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:48.200]   Well, here in Luke chapter 18, verse 31 through 33, Jesus is teaching the disciples, okay,
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.200]   and preparing them.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   But this is what He says.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:57.640]   "And taking the twelve, He said to them, 'See, we're going up to Jerusalem, and everything
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:03.240]   that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.'"
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.000]   And then He says, "For He will be delivered over the Gentiles, He will be mocked, He will
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.560]   be shamefully treated and spit upon, and after flogging Him, they will kill Him, and on the
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.000]   third day, He will rise."
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.520]   I mean, to the detail of what the Gentiles are going to do, how He's going to be treated,
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.680]   He knows what's coming, and my case to you is going to be, He is absolutely sovereign
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.840]   in all of that.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:33.160]   And as a matter of fact, even in the preparation to get there, He's completely sovereign.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.480]   And that's why, even long before, when does He start preparing to go to Jerusalem?
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.120]   In Luke chapter 9, verse 51, He says, "And when the day drew near for Him to be taken
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.880]   up," in some of your passages it'll say, "the ascension," "He set His face to go to Jerusalem."
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.880]   Wow.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:55.880]   And what I'm saying is, especially in this Passion Week, what's something glorious about
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.960]   our Lord Jesus Christ is that, even though there is an angry mom, even though even in
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.360]   the story read, the Pharisees are mad, even though the Pharisees are scheming to kill
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:11.360]   not only Jesus, but the evidence of Jesus' power, which is Lazarus, the man, you know,
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.880]   made alive again.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:19.160]   Even though all that's going on, Jesus is absolutely sovereign.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.840]   I want you to think about this.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.880]   Let's take a look at Luke chapter 19, okay?
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.600]   Reading a parallel passage of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:36.500]   And I want you to kind of pay careful attention to the sovereignty of Christ in all the preparation
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.320]   and in the details of this week.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.040]   I'm going to start reading from verse 28, okay?
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.960]   28 through 40.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.920]   And this is what the Scriptures has to say.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:51.160]   "After He had said these things, He was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:57.800]   When He approached Bethage and Bethany near the mount that is called Olivet, He sent two
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.400]   of the disciples, saying, 'Go into the village ahead of you.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:07.880]   There, as you enter, you will find a colt tied on, which no one yet has ever sat.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.680]   Untie it and bring it here.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.400]   If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?'
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.840]   You shall say, 'The Lord has need of it.'
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.060]   So those who were sent went away and found it just as He had told them.
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.440]   As they were untying the colt, its owner said to them, 'Why are you untying the colt?'
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.040]   They said, 'The Lord has need of it.'
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:31.040]   They brought it to Jesus, and they threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus on it.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.160]   As He was going, they were spreading their coats on the road.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.720]   As soon as He was approaching near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.640]   the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:49.440]   they had seen, shouting, 'Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.740]   Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!'
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.280]   Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, 'Teacher, rebuke your disciples!'
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:01.840]   But Jesus answered, 'I tell you, if these become silent, the stones will cry out.'"
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.040]   Okay, I want to highlight for you something interesting here.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.880]   I'm highlighting the idea that Jesus is sovereign.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.880]   Focus on the donkeys.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.880]   Okay, the donkeys.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.520]   I mean, I think to me, in my mind, this is a hilarious thing.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.920]   I mean, everything again from the bottle to even the donkeys is under the sovereign hand,
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.400]   the glorious sovereign hand of Christ.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.720]   Why do I say that?
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.400]   Because Jesus tells them ahead of time, the two disciples, I'm presuming that maybe Luke
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.480]   is one of them because the Gospel of John doesn't have this, but Luke does.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:36.920]   Luke says, "Jesus told us exactly what the owner would say."
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:41.440]   Jesus told us what we're to say and then we would get the donkeys.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:46.280]   And I just want you to think about this hilarious moment in Scripture with me, okay?
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.600]   There's two guys, they're sitting there like, "Oh man, we gotta go get some donkeys."
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.600]   You do it.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.520]   I don't want to be the guy who looks like he's going to steal a donkey, you know what
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.520]   I mean?
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.600]   I mean, essentially, because that's what they're doing, they're going to go over, they're going
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.520]   to untie this donkey and pull it over and then some guy is going to be like, "Hey, you,
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.520]   what are you doing?"
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.520]   Right?
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.760]   But instead, the owner is like, "Why are you untying my donkey?"
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:13.520]   And I could just imagine the two guys sitting there like, "Um," and then they're like,
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.680]   "Why are you untying it?"
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:19.440]   And they're like, "Oh shoot, he just said what Jesus said he would say."
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.640]   And then one of them goes, "The Lord needs it."
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.640]   Right?
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.560]   Like, "We're just going to try this.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.320]   The Lord needs it."
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.680]   And then they're like, "Go on your way."
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.480]   I'm like, "What in the world?"
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.480]   You go try it.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.480]   Jump in someone's car.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.480]   "The Lord needs this."
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.480]   You know?
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.120]   It's never going to work.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.240]   It's never going to work.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.320]   Coming down even to the very animal.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.320]   Please turn in your Bibles to Zechariah chapter 9 verse 9.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:52.120]   Jesus fulfills sovereignly, prophecy down to the very detail of even the animal that
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.320]   is going to carry him.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.760]   In Zechariah chapter 9 verse 9, this is what the passage says.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.120]   Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.320]   Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.200]   Behold, your King is coming to you.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   He is just and endowed with salvation, humble and mounted on a donkey, even on a colt, the
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.880]   fowl of a donkey.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.880]   Wow.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.880]   That's so crazy.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.680]   I mean, before this passage, I've never been so amazed by a donkey before.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.720]   I just want to show you how amazing this is.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:31.320]   It's so specific to the Scriptures that it says right here in Zechariah 9 verse 9, the
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.840]   second part of it, notice how it says, "He comes with salvation, humble, mounted on a
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.440]   donkey," and then he says, "Even on a colt, a fowl of a donkey."
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.440]   So here's an interesting thing.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.400]   If you study the passage and you compare the different parallels, some passages will say
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.000]   he brought a donkey and he rode on a donkey.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.940]   But Luke is more specific because I think he was involved.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.360]   It says that he brought a colt.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:58.040]   I had to Google what is a colt because I have no idea what a colt is.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.640]   Do you guys know?
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.960]   A colt is a baby.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.520]   A colt, you can say a colt is a baby horse, a baby donkey.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.840]   And so that's why Jesus says there hasn't been anyone who's even ridden this one yet,
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.920]   which means he was young.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.320]   And what's interesting is because the baby colt will only follow the mother, they've
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.920]   actually brought both and Jesus had the option of riding the mother donkey, which is bigger,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:33.000]   or the baby donkey, fulfilling prophecy to the very last detail, he rode the colt.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.680]   Pretty amazing stuff.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:39.200]   And I think about that and I say, "My goodness, the glory of Christ in fulfilling all of these
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.920]   details, fulfilling every single prophecy."
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:46.160]   And truthfully speaking, if you were to just research the various things, everything from
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.440]   the words that people say, the words "Hosanna," everything from the words that people say,
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.120]   "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord," everything in terms of what the people
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.800]   do, how he responds, it's all prophesied.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:05.560]   This as you know is one of the most prophesied, incredible moments of all history.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:10.560]   And what I'm saying is there is glory in our Savior, Jesus Christ, because he is absolutely
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.160]   sovereign in it.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:18.440]   But what's amazing about all that is the second part, his glory is expounded because not only
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:28.880]   is he so powerful and sovereign, he comes in so ridiculously humble, so humble.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:35.680]   And the obvious is there, he comes in riding in, everyone's like, "This is the Messiah,
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:40.480]   victory, we're going to have our revolution."
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:47.040]   And then he's coming in on this little donkey, like slow going, you know.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.800]   That's humble.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:54.640]   But I want to show you a different kind of humility, a kind of humility that's willing
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.200]   to bear the ignorance of the masses.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.360]   What do I mean by that?
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.240]   The people are singing, "Hosanna, Hosanna."
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:12.680]   There is a prophecy in Psalm 118, verse 25 to 26 that says, "Save us, we pray, O Lord.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.400]   O Lord, we pray, give us success.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.240]   Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.560]   We bless you from the house of the Lord."
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:25.840]   That prophecy, people recite every year, actually multiple times a year, different festivals
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.440]   and feasts of the Jewish culture.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:33.560]   And they recite this Psalm from Psalm 113 to 118, anticipating the Messiah.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.560]   They're singing it.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.560]   They're praising.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.560]   It's so loud.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.480]   Everybody's singing it.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:43.200]   You know, like for me, there was a time when, you know, you watch basketball games on TV.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.840]   There's an amazing shot and everybody goes wild, like, "Whoa!"
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.040]   You know, you at your house might go wild, "Whoa!"
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.720]   You know, with your buddies.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.320]   But it's different when you're actually there at a game.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.560]   Like I got a chance to go to a Laker game before, and I remember the feeling of having
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.200]   25,000 people scream at one time.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.120]   But remember at this time, there are not just hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.160]   There are literally millions.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.880]   There are commentators who kind of differ on like how many people.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.280]   There are people who like literally looked into record books.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.160]   Well, interestingly enough, they had record books of how many sacrifices are given at
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.120]   the Passover by the priests.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.880]   And so you can kind of tell how many families reside in Jerusalem as a demographic, meaning
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.480]   outside of Passover, how many people reside in Jerusalem.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.040]   The fact was that in Jerusalem, there was close to 200,000 people.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.480]   During Passover, where people take pilgrimage, you have literally millions of people coming,
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.480]   maybe a million, okay?
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.160]   I just want you to think about the craziest football stadium, the craziest basketball
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:50.800]   event, the craziest anything you've ever experienced, where a mass of people were screaming something
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.720]   in one unison.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.160]   It's powerful.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.160]   It's really powerful.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.560]   I'm going to try something with you guys, just for the sake of effect.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.440]   Okay, not with the mic, but we're going to just say on the count of three, one, two,
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.200]   three, "Hosanna!"
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.200]   Really loud, okay?
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.280]   On the count of one, two, three.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.280]   Don't prank me, all right?
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.280]   Don't leave me hanging.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.680]   Don't leave me hanging.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.680]   On the count of three, let's just yell, "Hosanna!"
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.680]   Okay?
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.680]   One, two, three.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.680]   "Hosanna!"
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.680]   That's pretty loud, right?
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.580]   In here is at max 300 people.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.120]   When you are at stadiums at max, you're at 30.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.360]   At football stadiums, 50, 60.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.680]   We're talking about a million people.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.800]   We can't fathom that, right?
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.480]   This is crazy.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.320]   But the thing about it is, the reason why I say this highlights the glory of Christ
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:49.880]   is because the night before, he was preparing for his triumphant entry.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:56.860]   The night before, he was preparing and anointed for his glorious entrance into Jerusalem.
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:01.060]   A Saturday night, he was getting prepared for his burial.
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.340]   Everybody else, the masses and ignorance is singing, "Yes!
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:12.540]   Now it's time for resurgence of the Jewish people, overthrow of the Roman government.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.220]   We're going to have our revolution.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.220]   That guy's going to lead us."
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:20.380]   He said, "The thing about it is, they praised him and said, 'You are a savior.'
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.380]   Correct.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.060]   They praised him and said, 'You are a king.'
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.060]   Correct.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.060]   'You're the Messiah.'
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.060]   Correct.
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.340]   But then they got palm branches and said, 'We're going to make you king to overthrow
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.340]   the government now.'"
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.340]   Wrong.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:37.340]   What's really interesting, I believe, I could be wrong here, but I think the palm
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.580]   trees were the mistake.
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.460]   Everything else is right.
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:46.300]   There's no prophecy of palm trees.
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:51.300]   There's no prophecy of him becoming this kind of king here and there because what the
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:56.340]   Scripture tells us is that first he's going to come to suffer and then he's going to
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.100]   come to reign.
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.880]   But my point is there's a glory in Jesus Christ because nobody understands him.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.460]   Not only do the masses not understand him, even his own disciples don't understand him.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.660]   The people who are closest to him don't understand him.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:15.580]   And he is now walking this path alone, in a sense, surrounded by a million people who
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.260]   don't get him.
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:22.820]   Have you ever felt alone, surrounded by a lot of people because people don't understand
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:23.820]   you?
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:30.620]   Have you felt what it feels like when people misinterpret what you say?
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:37.020]   They misjudge you, consider things that maybe alter your motives to you.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:43.880]   It's humbling for you to sit there and still walk the path, maintain your composure.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:52.540]   If I, because I'm prideful, was there, I would rebuke not the people, but everybody.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.180]   I would just rebuke everybody.
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.940]   You have no idea what you're saying.
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:05.700]   This past Friday I was teaching the collegians and as I was just thinking about what Christ
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.820]   did and especially in this season, there are certain things that Jesus said and I said,
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.900]   in this time, in this season, Jesus said some of the most truest statements ever.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.960]   Truest statements ever.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.660]   When he said, "Father, forgive them because they have no idea what they do."
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:26.380]   These people have no idea what they're asking for, no idea who they're looking at, and Jesus
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.780]   only wishes they would know.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:33.860]   And there's a great amount of humility for him to be able to bear underneath that kind
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:39.940]   of scenario, to still walk that path.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:46.260]   But walk with me a little bit down some other passages because I want to highlight, you
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:55.660]   know, I want to highlight another aspect of Jesus' glory as we, you know, follow this
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:59.420]   trail of what's happened during this week.
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:07.580]   Here's an interesting idea and I'm just going to carry it along from the idea that the people
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.220]   don't understand what he's really doing but Jesus is still set.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.100]   Jesus is still determined.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.500]   Jesus is so focused.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:22.780]   Scriptures would say that he set his face like flint and he was just going, right?
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:28.980]   Well, what's really interesting is what people did not understand was again, everybody expected
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.260]   him to come mighty.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:34.460]   Everybody expected him and they wanted to wave those palm branches.
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:38.500]   And I made the case that Jesus is humble because they were mistaken to wave those branches
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.500]   at that time.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:44.580]   Well, we asked the question, did ever Scriptures talk about palm branches, that he would come
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.820]   in this, you know, kingship and stuff?
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.300]   Yes, but where?
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:56.660]   If you actually turn your Bibles over to Revelation chapter 7, verses 9 through 12, here's where
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.980]   palm branches appear, okay?
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:07.340]   Revelation chapter 7, verses 9 through 12, this is where palm branches appear.
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.660]   And I think you guys already understand where I'm going with this.
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:15.980]   For we know in hindsight and we know because Scripture has told us that there is going
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:22.840]   to be a time when Jesus is going to come and he's going to be such a righteous king, such
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.420]   a powerful king.
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.380]   And this is what it says, "After this I looked," starting from verse 9, "After this I looked
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:33.300]   and behold a great multitude that no one could number even greater than that was in Jerusalem.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.060]   From every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages standing before the throne and
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:42.380]   before the lamb, clothed in white robes with palm branches in their hands and crying out
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:48.140]   with a loud voice, 'Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the lamb.'
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:52.380]   And all the angels were standing around the throne, around the elders and the four living
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:59.020]   creatures and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God saying, 'Amen,
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:04.620]   blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.700]   forever and ever.
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.060]   Amen.'"
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:12.460]   Now if you would turn to chapter 19 of Revelations, starting from verse 1, okay?
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:18.980]   So flip over a couple pages, go to chapter 19 of Revelations starting from verse 1.
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:24.060]   It says, "After this I heard what seemed to be a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:27.180]   crying out, 'Hallelujah!
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:33.260]   Salvation and glory and power belong to our God for His judgments are true and just.'"
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:39.700]   So same theme, same motif of Jesus Christ coming in and everybody singing, hosts of
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.620]   everyone singing to the Lord.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:46.140]   And then draw your eyes down to verse 11.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.180]   So Revelations chapter 19 verse 11.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:53.180]   "Then I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse.
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:57.660]   The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True and in righteousness.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.260]   He judges and makes war.
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:04.180]   His eyes are like a flame of fire and on his head are many diadems and he has a name written
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.660]   that no one knows but himself.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.900]   He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood and the name by which he is called is the Word
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.900]   of God.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:17.900]   And the armies of heaven arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.020]   horses.
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:23.540]   From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations and he will rule
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.380]   them with a rod of iron and he will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.380]   God the Almighty.
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:36.460]   On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords."
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:45.820]   So I'm making a long thought here which is first, Jesus is misunderstood and that shows
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.500]   his humility because he's still able to walk the path.
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:56.100]   But as we see, there is an incredible misunderstanding but yet he's so determined to do this even
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:01.180]   though he could have come with the way they expected.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:06.180]   And my point is going to be we see the glory then of Christ, not simply in his sovereignty,
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:10.520]   not simply in his humility but in his mercy.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.180]   In his mercy.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.180]   How is that so?
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.780]   How does this describe mercy?
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:20.300]   Because if he came the way they expected, everybody would die.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.960]   That's the truth.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:26.980]   If he came the way they wanted, everybody will be accursed, everybody will be judged
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:36.340]   because if he arrived the way they anticipated, he would have to come with judgment and wrath.
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:42.420]   He would have to come in glory and sinners cannot stand in that kind of glory.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:47.420]   The glory that we experience on his entrance into Jerusalem is the glory of his humility
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.660]   and mercy.
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:55.340]   Is the glory of him coming determined not to come as the lion but the lamb.
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:00.380]   That is mercy and mercy and mercy upon the people, everybody there and that's why he's
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:08.060]   expressing his heart to them, "I'm having mercy on you as I enter in on a cult."
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.900]   And I always wondered, what does Jesus look like?
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:16.420]   I wish I was there to see him because everyone's just dancing and they have their palm branches
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:21.140]   and they're crying out but I wondered what Jesus looked like because he could see through
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.060]   the heart of man.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.440]   He knew what they're selfishly thinking.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.780]   He knew the other category of people who were still kind of like, "I don't know about this
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:29.780]   Jesus."
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.180]   He knew the other people who were like, "I don't know what's going on but I'm just following."
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.620]   He knew what was going on in the hearts of people.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:39.040]   But what's more, he knew that what he was accomplishing.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.100]   They still had no idea.
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:46.580]   Well, thankfully for us, the scriptures tell us.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:57.380]   If you turn in your Bibles back to Luke chapter 19 verse 41, Luke chapter 19 verse 41, it
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:06.180]   says in this passage, okay, that after his entry towards Jerusalem and after the greatest
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:14.460]   human reception into Jerusalem ever, it says in verse 41, "When he approached Jerusalem,
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:21.460]   he saw the city and he wept over it saying, 'Only if you had known in this day even you
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.520]   the things which make for peace.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:28.980]   But now they have been hidden from your eyes for the days will come upon you when your
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:33.100]   enemies will throw up a barricade against you and surround you and hem you on every
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:37.620]   side and they will level you to the ground and your children within you and they will
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:43.100]   not leave you, leave in you one stone upon another because you did not recognize the
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.860]   time of your visitation.'"
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:53.100]   So we wonder, what was on the face of Christ as he was entering into Jerusalem while everybody
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:58.540]   was singing and everybody was in the hoopla, there were tears.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:03.620]   The sovereign Savior who is preparing everything, who is so powerful, he's orchestrating all
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:05.620]   of history, he's in tears.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:09.540]   The humble Savior who is walking in, even though everybody is shouting all this kind
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:14.180]   of stuff and he still has people who are antagonistic to him, he's in tears.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:21.060]   And to me this is such a rebuke as he sees the sin of a nation who is so wrought in their
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:26.300]   self-righteousness, in their, yes, proper doctrines, but they're still wrought in their
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:32.660]   sinful, depraved self-righteousness of Judaism.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.660]   So close, yes, so far.
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:39.740]   And although he knows these people are going to be the very ones to cry out for his crucifixion
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:44.780]   and then to bury him and reject him, yet he cries over them.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.020]   I'm going to tell you honestly, you know, there are times when I'm all arrogant and
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:52.340]   I think I'm like the most patient guy ever, but I'm not because I have sinful thoughts
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.780]   go through my head.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.580]   People's sin are exposed to me and I'm like, "Dang, what's wrong with you?"
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:01.620]   People's sin are exposed to me and I'm like, "How did you allow yourself to get there?"
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.580]   People's sin are exposed to me and I think, "I just need to fix you.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.180]   You just need to do what I say.
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.580]   Why don't you just do what I say?"
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:15.300]   But that's so unlike our Savior, isn't it?
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:20.880]   Sees the sins of the entire nation gathered together in one city and he just weeps.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:27.500]   There are a lot of times Jesus weeps, but his mercy overflows as his soul is turned
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:32.860]   and he weeps over them and he says, "Only if you knew who is visiting you.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.340]   Only if you knew how you could have true peace."
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:39.060]   Wow!
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.060]   This is the glory of our Savior.
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:46.180]   Not just in crazy like strength and power like, "Rawr, you're all dead."
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:52.500]   But this crazy power combined with mercy and humility.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:57.500]   It's so beautiful and it's so unlike us.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:04.220]   And so again, although the many people don't understand and they might be thinking, "Jesus,
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.980]   bring your kingdom."
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.900]   And maybe his 12 disciples, you know, they were the ones who were like, "Bring down your
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.220]   kingdom on Jerusalem and let's reign.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.060]   I'll reign with you."
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.460]   And Jesus is constantly teaching them, "You don't understand.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.540]   I have to do this first.
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.620]   Otherwise you're dead."
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:27.220]   Which brings me to a challenge.
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:30.860]   I bring it back to this is a time where we're supposed to examine our hearts and ask, "Do
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:35.020]   we really desire Jesus?"
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:41.660]   And let me exhort us, let's not be like the multitude who had ulterior desires for the
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:42.660]   Savior.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.380]   Remember in 1 Peter, if you guys are in our study, I've been teaching that Jesus is the
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.980]   chief cornerstone.
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:51.580]   He is the cornerstone, the central piece of redemptive history.
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:56.540]   He's the cornerstone of our church and he's the cornerstone of your lives.
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:00.900]   But then the passage in 1 Peter said, "He is a precious, precious possession for those
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:01.980]   who believe.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.500]   But those of you who don't, he becomes the what?
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.860]   Stumbling block."
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:11.060]   That is the case with every single person who's in the masses saying, "Oh, Jesus, come and
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.060]   do this for us."
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:16.060]   Once they realize that Jesus is not going to do that, they say, "Get out of the way.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.540]   You're in my way to get what I want."
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:24.460]   If we have ulterior desires, if ulterior motives and passions in our lives that are desiring
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:28.900]   the things of the world, not only is Jesus going to be irrelevant to you, he is going
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:32.700]   to get in your way.
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.380]   And your only option will be to try to eliminate him from your life.
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:39.620]   He's going to become your great stumbling block.
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:43.820]   Let's make sure that we don't fall into the same sin as the masses.
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:52.340]   But secondly, secondly, let's not make the same error of both the masses and the disciples,
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.780]   a gross error of presumption.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.780]   And I'm going to put it this way.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:02.020]   If you're having a hard time after, you know, trying to remember that Christ, the sovereign
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:07.860]   which you humble to himself, after remembering that Christ is merciful to us, so dedicatedly
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:13.020]   most merciful to us, but you're still saying like, "I can't muster up that kind of affection,
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.020]   you know.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:17.980]   I'm having a hard time really being thankful."
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.660]   Can I tell you this?
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:23.100]   It could be perhaps because your mirror is dirty.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.740]   What do I mean by that?
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.980]   That your mirror is dirty.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.020]   You're not looking at yourself the right way.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:36.460]   A gross presumption in every single individual at that time is they did not understand when
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.820]   they say, "Bring your kingdom, bring your authority," they presumed, "Of course, I'm
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.340]   in your kingdom."
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.740]   What they should have presumed is like, "Wait, hold on.
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.620]   I still have sin.
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.860]   I'm still unworthy of you.
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:51.220]   You're too holy to come here.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.220]   We're just going to die."
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:59.900]   "Depart from me," is what they should have said if they really saw themselves.
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:05.260]   Going back to the example of Mary, did you notice that she did not anoint the head of
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.380]   Jesus?
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.140]   That's what's customary.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.820]   When you anoint somebody, you anoint somebody on the head.
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.060]   Yes, you don't pour Gatorade on them.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:18.380]   You anoint them on the head with a little bit of oil to consecrate, to bless, and all
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.020]   that kind of stuff.
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:25.660]   But Jesus, when he was sitting there, Mary came and she only poured that on his feet.
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:30.140]   Then she untied her hair and started to wipe and clean his feet.
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:31.140]   What does that have to say?
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:35.140]   She's expressing to him, "Lord Jesus, you are of infinite value to me.
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:39.300]   I love you, but I'm not worthy of you.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.180]   I can barely come to serve you."
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:48.260]   Just like John the Baptist said, "I can't even touch your shoelace."
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:51.700]   That's the right way of seeing yourself.
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:55.720]   For see, when Mary sees, "I need you.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.180]   You are so vital to me.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.620]   Then you're going to make a scene.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.300]   Then you're going to bust through the door.
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:06.020]   Then I'm going to disturb you because I need you, because I am a sinner in need of you."
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:08.780]   Remember Jesus was saying, "There are those individuals who are just going to knock, and
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.300]   then there are those individuals who are going to knock persistently.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.300]   Are you sleeping?
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.180]   I need your help right now."
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:17.180]   Who is he going to answer?
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:22.700]   Blessed are those who recognize they're bankrupt, they're meek, and they realize they absolutely
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:25.500]   need the grace of God.
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:30.220]   Remember it was Jesus who was teaching us who is truly thankful, who overflows with
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:36.340]   gratitude, those who've been forgiven much.
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:40.340]   That has to be a perspective you see of yourself.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:44.500]   If you can't muster up affection for Christ, it could be because of a number of things,
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:51.020]   other desires, but it could be because we don't see ourselves appropriately.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:57.820]   The challenge for us today is as we think about Jesus' entry, remember this glory of
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:06.060]   a sovereign Savior dedicating to be merciful to those who don't deserve it.
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:11.540]   We want to make sure that our hearts are overflowing with gratitude, remembering, "Lord, thank
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:17.180]   you that that's the way you came and not how I see it in Revelations."
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:17.540]   Let's pray.
