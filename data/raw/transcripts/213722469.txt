[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.040]   Well, I'm sure that throughout the week, we've been all reflecting upon the Passion Week
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.720]   of Christ's journey to Jerusalem, and which is ultimately Christ's journey to the cross,
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.680]   and being filled with a level of just gratitude, being filled with a level of wonder.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.520]   And in terms of today, on Friday, there's so much that has happened.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.200]   There's a wealth of things to be thinking about and reflecting upon.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.760]   But today, I'm going to focus in and hone in on one aspect of what Christ did on His
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.400]   way to the cross.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.400]   I want to introduce that topic by asking you to think about people in your lives who have
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.360]   an incredible amount of patience.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.760]   There are these people who rarely ever get riled up.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.120]   They rarely ever get angry.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.720]   They never vocalize, you can't see it, you know, in terms of whether it's just even being
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.720]   annoyed.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.720]   You know, there are people like that.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.360]   And I remember when I was single and living with roommates, there was a roommate of mine
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.640]   who seriously no one ever have seen him get angry before.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.400]   And when you see people like that, you try to troll them a little bit, you know, try
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.400]   to mess with them.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.560]   We were all gathered together watching, I think it was a sport, probably a basketball
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.840]   game or whatever it may be.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.440]   And, you know, he just, I could tell like as he was watching, people would get in his
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.120]   way and stuff, but he would never say anything.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.680]   So decided to troll him a little bit.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.260]   And I actually just stood right in front of his view.
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.880]   So my behind was like right in his face and I was pretending like I was talking or like
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.880]   fixated on the TV.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.160]   And I could see at the corner of my mind, he's just kind of like leaning over to see
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.380]   past me.
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.160]   So of course, I just move over, you know, like and to block him some more.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.460]   And sure enough, he'll just kind of scooch over and move.
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.080]   And so sure enough, I just kind of scooch over too.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.920]   And it just kind of kept going.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.400]   And after a while, I got frustrated.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.280]   I turned around, I was like, "Why don't you say anything, man?"
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.520]   It's no fun when you don't like get riled up.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.920]   It's no fun when you don't get angry.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.920]   It's like, "This sucks."
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.120]   And then I just got...
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.160]   It's funny because I'm trying to get a rise out of him.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.320]   And in the end, I got a little bit frustrated.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.880]   See I use that as a means to talk about our God.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:26.780]   Our God, interestingly enough, He actually at times burns with anger, right?
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.840]   At times, He gets so angry, He describes Himself as a raging bull with steam coming out of
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:42.620]   His nostrils, ready to drive His horns into those who are doing abominable things.
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.900]   Quite the contrast, right?
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.520]   You expected me to say, "Oh, God is so patient," right?
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.280]   But actually, sometimes we think God is like that.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.200]   No matter what you do, never angry, never loses it.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.280]   It's true, God never loses it.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.220]   But He alone is one who has both power, authority, and the right to be wrathful.
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.720]   And Scripture says so many times in warning through every single generation that's existed,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.800]   you guys need to understand God is a God of wrath too.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.220]   And He actually in the book of Deuteronomy, Moses, when he is calling the nation to remember
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.560]   and get ready so that they can enter into the promised land, he says, "You guys remember
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.920]   that on Mount Horeb, God was so angry with you, His anger burned against you.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.080]   He burned against you so much so, He said He had to destroy you.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.160]   He had to destroy you."
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.960]   I want you to take your Bibles please and turn to Ezekiel chapter 22, verse 17 through
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   22, okay?
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:52.040]   Book of Ezekiel, book that we don't normally, you know, in our devotion stuff go through.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.240]   And I just want to use this verse to scare you, okay?
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.760]   To first get to this point where we're talking about anger, patience, and what I'm saying
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.640]   as a case to you is God at times in Scripture has shown not just annoyance with His people,
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.840]   not just impatience with His people, but He has burning anger towards His people.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.000]   Take a look at this, verse 17.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.480]   So Ezekiel 22, verse 17 through 22, "And the word of the Lord came to me saying, 'Send
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.760]   a man.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.400]   The house of Israel has become dross to me and all of them are bronze and tin and iron
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.160]   and lead in the furnace.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.760]   They are the dross of silver.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.800]   Therefore, thus says the Lord of God, 'Because all of you have become dross, behold, I am
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.880]   going to gather you in the midst of Jerusalem.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.840]   And as they gather silver, bronze, and iron, and lead, and tend into the furnace to blow
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.400]   fire on it in order to melt it.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.640]   So I will gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there and melt you.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.400]   I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you will be melted in
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.080]   the midst of it.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.320]   As silver is melted in the furnace, so you will be melted in the midst of it, and you
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.880]   will know that I, the Lord, have poured out my wrath on you.'"
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.760]   Wow.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.640]   Those are some of the most scariest words I have read in the Scriptures.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:25.000]   To think that God is so angry, He describes in vivid detail how He's going to pour out
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.880]   His anger on the people.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:37.800]   And I use that as a setup to say, it is this God, it is this God who at the same time,
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.520]   although He has every right to be, although He has in occasion expressed that anger, it
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:52.720]   is this magnificent, holy, and powerful God who suffers long with His people.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.240]   The aspect that I want to focus our attention on is that just like Father, the Son, Jesus
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:07.160]   Christ, exhibits an incredible amount of long-suffering, a steadfast patience, a kind-heartedness towards
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:14.520]   His people, and during especially this time of His passion when He is suffering most.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:22.240]   This long-suffering, it can be described as an ability to be self-restrained, even in
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.080]   the midst of dire circumstances, to have a control even when your anger is being stirred
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.920]   so that you don't retaliate immediately, so that you don't just blow up in anger, but
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:38.280]   rather you're willing to and able to withstand with endurance.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.640]   It's basically an individual with an incredibly long fuse, so to speak, right?
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.960]   If you would, turn your Bibles to 1 Peter chapter 2, verse 21 through 25.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.080]   This is a passage that has become so dear to me because in our weekday Bible studies,
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.720]   we've been studying this book, and it's talked so much about suffering, and every time it
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.280]   has talked about suffering, it pointed our attention to Christ.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.160]   And it specifically pointed our attention not simply to the fact that, yes, Christ suffered,
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:17.280]   but it pointed our attention to how He suffered, the manner and attitude by which He suffered.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.860]   So let's take a look at this passage.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.520]   1 Peter chapter 2, verse 21 through 25.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:28.040]   And it says, "For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.800]   you, leaving you an example that you should follow in His steps."
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.800]   And then look at this.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.720]   He quotes Old Testament and describes how He suffered.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:41.320]   "Who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in His mouth, and while being reviled,
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.560]   He did not revile in return.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.560]   While suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:53.080]   righteously, and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.160]   die to sin and live to righteousness.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.880]   For by His wounds you were healed, for you were continually straying like sheep, but
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.440]   now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls."
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:13.200]   So there in that passage in 1 Peter, the aspect of Christ's suffering that Peter uses to encourage
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.320]   the hearts of saints who have been suffering, who have been persecuted, who have been pushed
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.960]   to their limit, was to say, "Look.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:29.080]   Look at the way Christ exhibited such self-restraint and long-suffering, even in the midst of that
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.700]   injustice and persecution.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.160]   He did not surrender.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.200]   He did not break in the midst of His circumstances."
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.600]   That's what I want to highlight.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:48.080]   So as we come to this Passion Week, I want us to both rehearse the events that happened,
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.000]   but as we rehearse the events that happened, I want to make sure that we're focusing our
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.120]   attention at the pattern by which Christ exhibited in His glory the kind of long-suffering that
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.160]   He alone was able to do.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.360]   Please turn your Bibles now to Matthew chapter 26.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.440]   And just as a forewarning, we are going to flip to many different passages and read a
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:15.840]   lot of lengthy texts, but I hope in doing so we just see from this biblical narrative
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.680]   the flow of what's been happening in this week.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:28.440]   So reading Matthew chapter 26, verse 36 through 46, and from this passage I'm going to springboard
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.200]   into continually talking about Christ's long-suffering.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:38.200]   Verse 36, "Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane and said to His disciples,
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.960]   'Sit here while I go over there and pray.'
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.560]   And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be grieved and distressed.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.660]   Then He said to them, 'My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death.
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.560]   Remain here and keep watch with Me.'
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:58.420]   And He went a little beyond them and fell on His face and prayed, saying, 'My Father,
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.760]   if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me, yet not as I will, but as You will.'
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:10.440]   And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping and said to Peter, 'So you men could
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.680]   not keep watch with Me for one hour?
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.800]   Keep watching and praying that you may not enter into temptation.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.520]   The Spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.'
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.360]   He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, 'My Father, if this cannot pass away
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.680]   unless I drink it, Your will be done.'
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.720]   Again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy, and He left them again
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.400]   and went away and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.520]   Then He came to the disciples and said to them, 'You are still sleeping and resting?
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.980]   Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.840]   Get up, let us be going.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.520]   Behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand.'"
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.080]   So here's an interesting aspect that I want to highlight for you.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.280]   Again, there's so many things from this passage, but I'm highlighting one thing.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:07.480]   Before, when I read the passage of Gethsemane, yes, the main point of it is Jesus is praying
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:13.760]   to the Father and having this interaction where in truth and reality and in candidness,
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.680]   Jesus expresses His heart, right?
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.760]   And Jesus essentially wrestles and comes to a point of complete obedience to the will
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.920]   of God.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:30.680]   But I want to focus our attention on the longsuffering of Christ.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:36.040]   Because longsuffering is essentially, earlier I mentioned, yes, you're willing and able
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:44.680]   to bear underneath a long time of difficulty, hardship, and oppression.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:52.320]   But what's more, He's willing and able to bear under intense hardship, a mountain of
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.440]   hardship.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.260]   So there's both the duration and the intensity is what I'm talking about.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:02.240]   And here and now, something that was surprising to me is Jesus is describing His prayer.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.440]   He's talking about a time where essentially it's peace in the eyes of the disciples so
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.840]   that they're just resting, they're sleeping, they're tired.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.320]   But there is an invisible aspect to which Christ is suffering in this time.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:22.200]   Christ is being distressed in this time, and He is in complete agony.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.640]   So much so, the way that He describes it to His brothers, His disciples is, "I feel like
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.000]   I'm going to die."
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.520]   Did you ever catch that?
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:39.520]   I'm talking about the intensity under which Christ is able to longsuffer.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:47.080]   And even in the moment of His prayer, He says, "I feel like I'm going to die."
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.340]   There was a book that I read by a beloved professor of mine.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.400]   It's called "The Cup and the Glory."
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.760]   And in that cup, my professor makes this case.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:03.420]   In various moments of Jesus' ministry on earth, we don't see it, but Jesus is under so much
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:10.420]   distress, so much pain, so much oppression, He talks as if He is going to die, and He
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.420]   makes this case.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:18.720]   The reason why is because Satan has made it a point to make Jesus the focal point of His
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.920]   unleashed attack.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.480]   And I want you to think about that for a moment.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:30.440]   My case being that throughout Jesus' ministry, not just here, but throughout the entirety
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:36.920]   of His ministry, Satan has made it a point to attack Jesus as much as he can in order
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.360]   to what?
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.300]   To break Him.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.880]   To prevent Him from going to the cross.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.720]   To make Him disobey the will of God.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.080]   I mean, just think about it for a moment, okay?
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.120]   I'm going to make a corollary here.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:58.920]   There was a time when Satan made this same strategy on a saint, namely Job.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.640]   God said, "Look at My servant.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.280]   There's nobody like Him.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.200]   Faithful, strong, persistent.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.200]   He loves Me.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.120]   His heart is for Me," right?
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.600]   And then Satan says, "Well, you think He's so good, but just watch.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.200]   Take away all His protection.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.520]   Take away all His possession.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.080]   Take away His family, and we'll watch Him.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.840]   We'll watch Him curse you to your face."
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.240]   And God says, "Try Him," right?
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.680]   What's really interesting is by corollary, Jesus comes on scene.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.160]   John the Baptist is baptizing people in the Jordan River.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.880]   Jesus comes on scene, and as soon as John the Baptist baptizes Him, He comes out of
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.880]   the water.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.880]   Do you guys remember what happens?
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.480]   The heavens opens up, right?
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:46.160]   And God says with a loud, booming voice as the Spirit is coming down in the form of a
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:53.440]   dove, God says, "Look, this is My beloved Son, whom I'm so well pleased."
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.760]   You know what happens immediately after?
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.120]   Satan tempts Him.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.060]   Jesus is pushed into the wilderness.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.800]   He fasts for 40 days.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.200]   He doesn't have food or drink.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.920]   And then in His weakness, Satan comes, and what does he do?
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.440]   He tests Jesus just like he tested Job.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.400]   But then there's something even more profound to that, is as the time goes on, the intensity
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:24.500]   increases because even with Job, Satan increased the intensity of his attack.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.920]   And Job essentially asked permission from God.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.120]   Here I'm just going to read the passage to you.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.120]   You don't have to turn there.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.200]   It says Job chapter 2, verse 4, "Satan answered the Lord and said, 'Well, skin for skin, yes,
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.680]   all that a man has, he will give for his life.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:44.640]   Here, put forth your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   to your face.'
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.480]   So the Lord said to Satan, 'Behold, he is in your power.'"
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.120]   Wow.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.000]   My guess is Satan did it before.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.200]   Satan can do it again.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.260]   And his scheme has always been the same.
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:05.640]   He will accuse, he will attack, he will tempt with any way possible for you to disobey the
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.760]   will of God.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:15.200]   And my belief is that Satan has made it his ambition to attack our Savior, to cause pain
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   and grief.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.640]   I know because Scripture has said, Satan clearly, just like he attacked the family of Job, Satan
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.320]   clearly asked for permission to strike the disciples.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:32.840]   Jesus says it himself to Peter, "Peter, Satan has asked permission to shift you like wheat,
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.200]   but I pray for you."
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.880]   And so what I'm saying is, Jesus, there is an incredible, amazing aspect of our Lord
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.280]   where we don't necessarily recognize it, but not just here in this week, but what I'm saying
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.960]   is both the duration.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.240]   He was attacked from long ago.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:17:01.120]   His entire life coming to the ground, being incarnate, he suffered.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:09.200]   He was stricken and that whole journey was his path to his suffering.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:15.600]   And so what I see in that is amazing capacity, a willingness and ability of Christ to long
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.440]   suffer for the sake of what God has set before him.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:27.360]   Now to magnify the suffering that Christ exhibited, I want you guys to take a moment.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.640]   Think about an alternative universe, so to speak.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.520]   Think about what if scenario, hypothetically.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.600]   What if Jesus wasn't so long suffering?
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.440]   What if Jesus wasn't so determined?
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.480]   What if Jesus wasn't so restrained?
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.640]   And like many of us, we had a breaking point.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.320]   We said, "Forget this."
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.840]   We had a breaking point of our patience.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.240]   "Forget you."
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.480]   We had a breaking point of the control and restraint that we had and we started to unleash
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.000]   our anger and wrath.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.400]   Well, as we take the narrative of the stories that happened, turn your Bibles to John chapter
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.760]   18 and you're continuing on in the story.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.320]   First we were at Gethsemane where Jesus was praying.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.720]   We know essentially Jesus after that point says, "Arise, we must go.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.040]   The one who's going to betray me is at hand."
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.720]   And we know the story of what happens.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:24.720]   Jesus comes, betrays him with a heinous kiss and all this stuff happens where there's this
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:32.000]   army, there's people with clubs and even Peter who is trying to defend and fight for his
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.400]   Savior comes with the sword and he takes a swing and cuts the ear of his servant and
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.560]   there's this nasty scene and Jesus says, "Put your sword away," right?
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.400]   And he puts the ear back on.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:56.760]   But after that what ends up happening, oh sorry, the Roman cohort takes, sorry, I'm
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.440]   trying to piece together a couple things here.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:05.160]   Okay, so right at that scene when Peter does that Jesus puts the ear back on, right?
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.880]   And what's really interesting is as I'm asking you guys to think of an alternative universe,
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:18.320]   Jesus actually indicates, "Peter, you just swung with the sword but you don't realize
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:23.760]   alternatively I can do better," right?
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.840]   You guys are over at John 18 but what I meant to say was Matthew 26.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.440]   That's why I kind of got lost.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.000]   Matthew 26.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.560]   And we're looking at verse 52 to 54, Matthew 26, 52 to 54.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:48.160]   Essentially Jesus says to them, Jesus says to Peter, "Put your sword back into its place.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.520]   For all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword or," look at this, "or,"
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.180]   alternative universe, "do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father and He will at
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:04.040]   once put at my disposal more than 12 legions of angels?
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:10.120]   How then will the Scriptures be fulfilled which say that it must happen this way?"
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.360]   So here's what I'm talking about.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.480]   In order for us to be appreciative of Christ's long suffering, we think of this alternative
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.480]   universe.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:24.800]   What Christ could have done is just simply called upon His angels who are at His disposal.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:30.360]   He could throw at them everything He's got and He says He has legions of them.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:35.520]   And what's really interesting about them for us is in terms of the long suffering, it makes
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.160]   it even more special so to speak, even more difficult.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.160]   Why?
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.760]   It's one thing for you to endure through something that you have no control over.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.660]   You're just being dragged through the mud and you can't help it.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.660]   So what do you say?
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.020]   I can't do anything.
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.420]   And so you allow yourself to be pulled through that.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.320]   But what if you had the power to do so?
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.560]   What if you had not only the power but the right to do so?
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:06.960]   What if you had authority and the availability just to say, "Stop!
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.960]   Knock it off!"
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   Right?
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.280]   It would be so much harder for you.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.840]   So much harder for you to long suffer underneath that.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:21.400]   And that's what I'm saying is Christ, although He had every inclination and power to do so,
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.280]   it amazes us all the more that He was steadfast.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:31.480]   So as we continue to go through the various trials, the various sufferings that Christ
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.800]   endured, we're going to keep focusing on this idea.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.960]   Now turn your Bibles over to John 18.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   Okay?
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:47.600]   And one of the things I want to talk about is, as I have you thought about a situation
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:53.440]   where you have every right to say your peace, you have every right to defend yourself, and
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.840]   yet you exhibit, or you're called to exhibit, a kind of long suffering where you exhibit
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.840]   a patience.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   Right?
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.800]   I feel like as I was reading through the story and narrative of what happened on Friday,
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:12.220]   the scenario of the trials that Christ endured spoke loudly of that very thing.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.840]   Having a long suffering, even when, alternatively, you can speak up.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.160]   So as I take a look at this, I want to read to you this section, starting from verse 12.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.160]   So John chapter 18, starting from verse 12.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.920]   He says, "So the Roman cohort and the commander and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:34.880]   and bound Him and led Him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.840]   was high priest that year.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.120]   Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.920]   die on behalf of the people."
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.720]   Now that wasn't like, "I believe in the Savior, He's going to substitutionarily die for us
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   to be saved."
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:54.200]   He says, "We are losing our power and people are going astray.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.160]   It's better if this man, this troublemaker, dies."
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.160]   Okay?
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.080]   Verse 15, "Simon Peter was following Jesus and so was another disciple.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.760]   Now the disciple was known to the high priest and entered with Jesus into the court of the
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.960]   high priest.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.920]   But Peter was standing on the door outside, so the other disciple, who was known to the
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.960]   high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper about Peter.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.920]   Then, the slave girl who kept the door said to Peter, 'You're not also one of this man's
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.480]   disciples, are you?'
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.920]   And he said, 'I am not.'"
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.520]   What's very interesting about this narrative is it's going to jump back and forth from
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.440]   Jesus' trial to Peter's denial.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.600]   Jesus' trial to Peter's denial.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.600]   Why?
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.960]   Because I believe there is a contrast happening here.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.900]   There is one who is being tried and he's going to exhibit a characteristic which we're focusing
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:49.040]   on today and then there's going to be one who is exhibiting succumbing to the circumstances
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.120]   and succumbing to the fear of man.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.360]   Let me keep reading in verse 18, "Now the slaves and the officers were standing there.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.080]   Having made a charcoal fire, for it was cold and they were warming themselves, and Peter
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.040]   also with them, standing and warming himself.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:07.200]   The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.440]   And Jesus answered him, 'I have spoken openly to the world.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.400]   I always taught in the synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews came together,
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.440]   and I spoke nothing in secret.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.200]   Why do you question me?
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.080]   Question those who have heard what I spoke to them.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.880]   They know what I said.'
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:28.000]   When he had said this, one of the officers standing nearby struck Jesus, saying, 'Is
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.640]   that the way you answer the high priest?'
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:35.240]   Jesus answered him, 'If I have spoken wrongly, testify of the wrong.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.720]   But if rightly, why do you strike me?'"
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:45.280]   Now as we look at that, what I'm talking about is there is a series of trials that Jesus
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.560]   goes through from here on.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:56.580]   And it struck me really just like deeply, wow, there is an ability of Christ to bear
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:01.280]   under injustice, complete injustice.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.000]   So much so, people are wrongly accusing him, people are questioning him, and the entire
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   scenario is upside down.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.080]   Think about how backwards this scene is.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:21.800]   Christ, the Son of God, He who created the world, He who has immense authority and power,
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.080]   He should be questioning this man who was wicked.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.800]   Did you know that this man, he's called the high priest here, not because he's the current
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.160]   high priest, because he was a former high priest.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.240]   He's an individual just like currently in our day, when we have an individual who's
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:42.840]   president, for example, President Obama or President Bush, their session has passed.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.400]   But what do we call them?
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.040]   President Obama, right?
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:52.320]   But this individual held on to his title and essentially was like a puppet master, reigning
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.560]   the temple.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:59.760]   So much so that even Jewish documents like the Talmud would talk about this man, because
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:05.200]   he is the one who started to really work with the Roman government to corrupt the temple.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.120]   And that's why they would call it, Annas' Bazaar.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.200]   The temple was a bazaar, a marketplace where there was a corruptness, there was selling
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.680]   and trade and swindling people and ripping people off and causing people to come into
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:27.040]   the temple for sacrifice, but then taxing them, leeching them, taking their money.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:33.560]   And what's profound to me is here's a scene, Jesus comes in, holy and pure, and now he's
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.040]   being questioned and examined.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.400]   And as soon as he says, "Why are you even questioning me?
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.160]   I was with you all the time."
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.280]   And boom, someone punches him in the face and says, "Respect this man."
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.000]   Who are you to speak to Annas that way?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.600]   Everything is so backwards, but did you know, and this is something I learned as I was walking
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.720]   through this.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.200]   When you read different parts of the gospel, you think, okay, and Jesus was tried and he
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:04.840]   was given over to Pilate, but Jesus was tried a total of six times.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.880]   Jesus will be tried and examined by the Jews and the leaders and the Pharisees, not once,
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.240]   but three times.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.640]   Then they would turn him over to the Gentiles and then he would be examined again and again.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.240]   So if you turn your Bibles over to Matthew chapter 26, I'm not going to read the whole
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.000]   thing, but a portion of it, okay?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.920]   It says here in this passage that first the father-in-law of the current high priest examined
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.000]   him and he ridiculed him.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.680]   He mocked him and questioned him.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.360]   And then he sent him over to the current high priest Caiaphas, and that's why you have these
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.480]   different names.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.720]   So Matthew chapter 26, verse starting from 57, "Those who had seized Jesus led him away
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:49.120]   to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.320]   But Peter was following him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.960]   and entered it and sat down with the officers to see the outcome.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.960]   Now the chief priest and the whole council kept trying to obtain false testimony against
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.560]   Jesus so that they might put him to death.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.920]   They didn't find any, even though many false witnesses came forward.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:13.480]   But later on, two came forward and said, 'This man stated, "I am able to destroy the temple
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.760]   of God and to rebuild it in three days."'
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:21.160]   The high priest stood up and said to him, 'Do you not answer?
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.480]   What is it that these men are testifying against you?'"
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.000]   And then look at this, "But Jesus kept silent.""
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.880]   I mean, talk about the most botched trial ever.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.040]   I mean, they were doing everything wrong.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.760]   According to Jewish custom, you're not allowed to have a trial like this in the middle of
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.760]   the night with select people.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:47.000]   And it's so obvious, these Pharisees are like, "Do you have something to say?
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Come on over.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.880]   Just say you heard him say this.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.080]   Just say you heard him say that."
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:56.320]   And all of it is just coming out and everything is just like, "Oh no."
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.800]   It's just the most ridiculous trial ever and even the stuff that people are saying, people
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.760]   can see right through it.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:10.600]   And so Jesus, in the midst of that, you would think, you would think he would say, "Woe
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.740]   to you, you liars.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.740]   You hypocrites.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.440]   How dare you?
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.040]   Do you know who I am?"
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.600]   And that's what I would say.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:27.800]   But it's so profound that Jesus would sit there and have what seems to me, what seems
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.360]   to the world like weakness.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.000]   "What, you've got nothing to say?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.760]   You coward."
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:40.420]   But spiritually what we see is incredible strength, incredible strength and ability
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.480]   to suffer long.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.360]   And then later on, just for the reference, Luke chapter 22 talks about the next trial
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:52.640]   where the full Sanhedrin, so what gives the inclination that this is a separate trial
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.080]   is because here you have Caiaphas and then you have these high priests gathered together,
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:02.600]   but later there's a trial where the full Sanhedrin, the full council of the elders and the chief
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:07.940]   priests and the scribes, everybody comes together and then they start to question him and examine
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:08.940]   him.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:15.720]   Now as I look at this, can I just speak to you frankly?
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:21.440]   Remember how earlier I was telling you that like there are people who don't get angry,
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.960]   there are people who don't fend for themselves?
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.360]   And I found that as a pastor, you know, as I counsel people who are younger than me and
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.600]   stuff, sometimes I get frustrated, you know?
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.400]   I get frustrated like, "Why are you going through all that?
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.760]   You know, why don't you just say this and say that?"
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.660]   Whether it's they feel like they're getting impressed by their boss or whether they're
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.040]   feeling like they're getting impressed by their parents, you know, we have situations
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:49.640]   in life where people come over you in that manner, you know?
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:55.220]   There was a feeling in my heart as I was reading this, I started to get indignant.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.200]   Like I almost started to be like, "Jesus, you should say something!
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.140]   This is crazy!"
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:05.140]   And every time they're mocking him and ridiculing him and later on they'll say, "Even the chief
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:11.500]   priest, these dignified noble chief priests start to spit on him, start to slap him, start
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.500]   to beat him."
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:17.800]   And I started to feel this like anger, this indignance like, "This is the most ridiculous
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.340]   thing in all the universe!"
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:26.260]   And there was a moment when even the chief priest in other passages like the Gospel of
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:31.020]   Mark when they're attacking Jesus, they'll say, "By God Almighty, you need to speak answer
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.020]   us!
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.020]   Are you?
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.020]   Are you who you say you are?
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.380]   You're the preaching of the Jews, you know?"
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:40.700]   And I remember reading that thinking like, "Oh my goodness, how dare you!
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.260]   How dare you invoke the name of God!
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.660]   You're profaning him right now!
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.460]   You blind, arrogant, lying!"
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:54.060]   You know, I just started getting mad.
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:32:00.420]   And then I started getting humbled because it just amazes me.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:05.900]   I'm not, I mean, I've never experienced anything even close to this, not even remotely close
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:06.900]   to this.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.700]   And I'm willing to guess the vast majority of us in this entire room has ever experienced
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.940]   anything remotely close to this.
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:19.380]   But Jesus is exhibiting a kind of strength beyond compare.
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.700]   And I didn't realize that before.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.020]   He's being tried over and over and over again.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.100]   I mean, some of you guys are in the legal field, you know there's a law, and even in
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.780]   America, you're not allowed to do this.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.740]   There's a law called double jeopardy where you're not allowed to be tried for the same
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:39.860]   thing and accused and then be convicted multiple times for the same infraction and then you
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.340]   get sentenced and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.380]   But here and now Jesus is going to be tried even more.
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:51.780]   And so, and I'm not supposed to, but it keeps going.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:58.300]   Please turn in your Bibles to Luke chapter 23, Luke chapter 23.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:06.420]   Here and now as the collective gathering of all the Jewish leaders, even those who are
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:12.500]   political enemies, come together to convict Jesus and say He's worthy of death.
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.700]   They ultimately then hand Him over to the Roman government and now He stands before
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.540]   Pilate, right?
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:23.340]   And I made the case that this was profound because He's being tried over and over again
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:30.580]   and now He's going to experience a series of examinations under the Roman governors.
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.820]   Underneath Pilate in verse 1 through 2, He says that when the whole body of them got
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:39.420]   up and brought Him before Pilate and they began to excuse Him saying, "We found this
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.860]   man misleading our nation."
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.620]   It's like, "What?
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.060]   He's not misleading the nation.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.060]   You are, suckers."
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.780]   Sorry, it's my indignation coming out.
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:52.140]   And then they start to lie and then He was forbidding to pay taxes.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.500]   What?
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.500]   Everybody heard Him.
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.020]   He never forbade to give taxes.
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:58.820]   He actually said, "Render to Caesar what is Caesar's."
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:59.820]   Right?
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:04.420]   He's saying that He Himself is Christ the King.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:08.020]   And then Pilate starts to ask Him, "Is that right?
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.260]   Is that who you say you are?"
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.260]   And He goes underneath that kind of examination.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.740]   And then next, Pilate after seeing like, "I don't know."
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:18.780]   And he turns to the Pharisees and the rulers and says, "I don't see anything deserving
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:19.780]   of that.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.340]   As a matter of fact, I don't think this is even a matter of this court.
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.700]   He's talking about kingship over you guys, your religious kingship.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:27.700]   Go talk to King Herod."
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:28.700]   Right?
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.980]   And so he goes under King Herod and starting from verse, I'm going to read from verse 8.
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:36.740]   It says, "Now King Herod was very glad when he saw Jesus, for he had wanted to see Him
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:41.060]   for a long time because he had been hearing about Him and was hoping to see some sign
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.740]   performed by Him.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:48.760]   And then he started to question Him at some length, but He answered him nothing.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.980]   And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there accusing Him vehemently.
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:57.420]   And Herod with his soldiers were threatening, treating Him with contempt and mocking Him,
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.460]   dressed Him in a gorgeous robe and sent Him back to Pilate."
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.460]   And you notice what it's saying there.
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.820]   It's like there is this repeated vehement...
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:09.580]   That's why I keep talking about these words of long suffering, intense suffering, because
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:14.140]   you see it even in the examinations by the Gentiles.
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:18.620]   And then in verse 13, he goes back underneath Pilate and underneath at verse 13, that's
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:24.620]   what he says, "Pilate says to the chief priests and the masses, 'I don't find fault in Him.'"
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.620]   Right?
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:31.460]   So, I'm just going to kind of summarize this section just so that for the sake of time.
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.700]   Okay?
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.740]   What's really interesting is underneath Pilate, Pilate says, "I don't find fault in Him.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:37.740]   Herod doesn't find fault in Him.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.620]   I don't get what you guys are doing."
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:44.140]   As a matter of fact, what's really interesting about this is Pilate sees through all the
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.460]   facade of the Pharisees.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:52.580]   You come here and you essentially try to like get me riled up by saying, "He doesn't want
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.140]   to pay taxes to Caesar.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.020]   He wants to overthrow the Roman government."
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.340]   But Pilate actually sees through all their lies.
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.580]   He knows they're just jealous.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.780]   And he tells them, "I don't see what you guys are doing.
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:10.100]   I don't see fault to put this man to death."
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:14.060]   And you know what's really interesting about this is as he's saying that, the people continue
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.060]   to cry then.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.100]   They say, "No, we want Him.
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.140]   We want Him.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.780]   Not those criminals, but this criminal."
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.500]   Right?
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:26.900]   And so, if you go over to verse 22, we're in Luke chapter 23, and we're looking at,
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.700]   and please look over to verse 22.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.740]   "He said to them," how many times?
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.420]   A third time, "Why?
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.340]   What evil has this man done?
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:39.220]   I have found in him no guilt demanding death.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.100]   Therefore, I will punish him and release him.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.420]   But they were," what?
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.500]   "Insistent with loud voices asking that he be crucified.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:53.700]   And their voices began to prevail, and Pilate pronounced the sentence that their demand
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.980]   be granted."
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:00.340]   So we think about that for a moment.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.460]   And to me, that's quite profound.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:10.260]   Before the incursory reading of this text, I didn't realize how vehemently determined
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.180]   they were to set him to the cross.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:19.500]   I mean, Pilate, yes, he goes down in history as the man who sentenced the death, right?
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:24.820]   In the creeds that we have, he goes down in history as the guy.
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:29.660]   But actually, when you see it, three times he tried to convince the masses, "I don't
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.180]   see it.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.300]   He doesn't deserve this."
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.620]   And then he washes his hands.
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:40.620]   But it's the crowd who continues to cry out vehemently, so much so he essentially has
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.620]   to give in.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.620]   He has to give in.
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.740]   So this is quite crazy in terms of the things that happen.
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.500]   The verdict is in.
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.740]   Jesus then gets sentenced.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.500]   And essentially, Jesus gets condemned.
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.500]   He's examined, tried, and cursed.
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:01.140]   Cursed by men, cursed by God.
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.620]   Now I want to move into a section here.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:07.300]   So far, I hope you guys are getting what I'm doing.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:14.380]   I wanted to show you that so much in terms of the length, the duration of his suffering
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.460]   was beyond perhaps what we assumed before.
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.900]   And that causes me to feel a sense of like, "Wow."
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:26.660]   Before I didn't appreciate that every step then, when it's long and hard, and every step
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:31.660]   then, Christ had to be that much more determined.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:36.500]   But now I want to move into a section going to this repetitive idea of the intensity of
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.700]   the suffering.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.860]   Because the verdict is in.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.180]   The sentence is said.
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.740]   And Christ is going to be executed by crucifixion.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.380]   As I was preparing this sermon, it's already going a little bit long.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:53.460]   And as I was preparing, I hesitated.
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:58.420]   Because I assumed that perhaps if you have been Christian for some time, then you already
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.940]   probably have heard sermons where a pastor has described in great detail, maybe in gruesome
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.060]   detail, right?
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.260]   The crucifixion of Christ.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:11.540]   The details about his whipping, the flogging, and then the cross.
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.900]   And there was a moment where I hesitated.
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.720]   I said, "Should I even talk about this?"
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.900]   But absolutely we should.
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:19.900]   Why?
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.220]   Because it's real.
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.220]   Why?
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.220]   Because it's true.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.220]   Why?
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.220]   Because we have to remember.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.220]   Why?
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.300]   Because we're actually prone to forget.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.980]   We're actually prone to not appreciate the cross as much.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.980]   Why?
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:37.260]   Because we don't appreciate the details and the depth, and I'm going to use my key word
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:45.200]   again, the intensity of what Christ has suffered.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:53.400]   And what's more, if any of us, if any of us in this room are struggling, and I want
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:59.440]   to speak to you guys, if any of you are struggling to find in your heart the sense of like affection
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.440]   for Christ.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:05.280]   If this week, you know, pastors and friends and everybody's like, "Oh my goodness," and
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.160]   they're posting online, all that kind of stuff, and you don't find that same kind of drive,
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.320]   you don't find that same kind of conviction.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:17.560]   If perhaps it's hard for you to muster up when you come into service a sense of any
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:25.600]   emotion, then let this be a time for you to be reminded that although perhaps sometimes
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:30.800]   our affections are fading, let us remember together the length and intensity of the suffering
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:37.640]   of Christ so that we would appreciate, yes, the grace of God is free to us, but it costs
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.040]   our Savior so much.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:48.800]   I want to start by saying and remind us that how involved Satan was in all the midst of
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.800]   this.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:55.080]   How involved the adversary, how involved the accuser was involved in all of this.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:59.040]   Although it was invisible, I believe again that Satan in so many different ways is inflicting
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:05.640]   pain that we cannot see, but then that pain becomes absolutely visible.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:13.200]   I began by reminding us that Scripture says that as soon as Pilate said, gave the sentence,
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:17.400]   the soldiers took him away and they flogged him.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.400]   They flogged him.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.800]   And what I want to remind us of this is this, that the flogging in of itself, there's a
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.920]   sense in which it was unnecessary.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.920]   Why?
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.920]   Because flogging itself was a form of execution.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:37.200]   For Jesus to have been flogged and then crucified, it was like a double, a double execution of
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.440]   this individual.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:44.440]   As you guys might have heard before, flogging was done by what's called the cat of nine
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:52.760]   tails, a leather whip that has strands laced with what could be glass or in pieces of metal.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:58.080]   So that when an individual is whipped by that, the pieces would dig into the skin and tear
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.600]   out chunks of flesh.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.800]   If you guys remember a long time ago, it's already been so many years, like it was produced
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:10.640]   in 2004, the movie, The Passion of Christ, right?
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:16.560]   And perhaps you saw a visual representation of what that flogging would have looked.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.480]   What's really interesting is if you look into the story behind that, the actor, I believe
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:26.160]   his name is, I couldn't pronounce it so I wrote it, Jim Cavazzo.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.160]   Jim Cavazzo.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.920]   That's how you pronounce it.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:35.640]   This actor, he talks about in kind of a testimony of his experience of playing that role.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:41.080]   He says that when they were filming that scene, they were very cautious, obviously because
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.240]   it's incredibly dangerous.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.760]   Mel Gibson was a risk taker.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.840]   He was a gambler.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:51.240]   So he actually used real whips and he actually used this cat of nine tails and then they
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:56.760]   had it set out and they used Italian actors in Rome to do it, right?
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:02.800]   And what happened was they made a fake piece of flesh on the back and it was a metal sheet
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.400]   that went like a shield over his back.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:10.040]   The story goes that Mel Gibson told the Italian actors, the soldiers, right?
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:15.400]   I want you to really wind up and give it like real gusto as you whip him.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.360]   In fact, make it like a bat swing, you know?
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.680]   And I guess the story goes like they didn't have, they didn't know like American baseball,
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.600]   they didn't understand like, "What are you talking about?"
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.280]   And say, "Oh, kind of like cricket," you know?
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:29.560]   And essentially what they did is, "Okay," and they start going back and they started
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.640]   running and whipped him, right?
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.440]   Now this force was so strong that the whip wrapped around the metal and it actually caught
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.440]   him.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.720]   It caught Jim on his side and ripped out a piece of skin and now he has a 15-inch scar
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.800]   and it was like an open gash along his side.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:49.120]   And he said, immediately hit the floor and he felt like he was about to die.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.620]   That's pretty wild.
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:55.480]   But the judgment that Jesus Christ received was not one whipping.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.080]   He was not protected by the metal shield.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.080]   It wasn't staged.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.400]   It wasn't drama.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.960]   He was whipped.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:10.400]   Scripture says that what was ordered was that he would be whipped 39 times because by the
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:15.280]   time people got to the 40th, they would normally die.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.920]   Can you imagine?
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:22.060]   One stroke of that whip would literally rip an individual's back, cause flesh to be
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.560]   teared and he felt like he was going to die.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:30.020]   But that flogging would continue 39 times.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.260]   I'm guessing there was bleeding profusely.
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:34.180]   I'm guessing he would be falling down.
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:37.220]   He couldn't hold himself up.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:44.120]   And then he had to carry his beam on which he was to be crucified up the hill.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:49.400]   They say some 1500 to 2000 yards up the hill.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:54.100]   And so much pain, so much agony was there that he could not carry it and he eventually
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.340]   collapsed.
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:02.220]   And later on, as he came to the hill, you know the story of the crucifixion, but I want
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:06.000]   to describe it in greater detail.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:12.060]   As we think about what the soldiers were doing, this was the most gruesome, I want to say
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.940]   barbaric, right?
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.900]   Barbaric torture of any individual.
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:24.100]   The crucifixion was so heinous that in Norman culture, Roman citizens were not allowed to
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:27.100]   be executed in this fashion.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:35.700]   It was so, I guess, unspeakable that Roman philosophers, it was even recorded by Cicero,
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.700]   that if you were in regular talk and you're in polite company, if you're just regularly
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.860]   talking with anybody, you don't even name that thing.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.100]   You don't even talk about that thing.
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.100]   Why?
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.140]   Because it was so shameful.
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:52.380]   I want to describe the aspects of the crucifixion a bit here.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:57.260]   For us, when we think about the crucifixion, perhaps we have images where Jesus is wrapped
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:02.660]   and at least there's a garment or some kind of cloth around him, around his midsection.
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:08.520]   But stereotypically, when an individual was crucified, he was completely stripped naked
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:15.380]   so that he would be shamed, so that he would be bare, so that he would be exposed.
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:21.500]   The crucifixion had as its intent that the individual who was being crucified would be
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:28.580]   a specimen, that he would be an example, almost like an insect pinned to the board.
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:34.860]   Jesus was nailed to the cross as a way to say, "Look, everybody look.
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.700]   Look what happens when you go against the Roman government.
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.360]   Look what happens when you sin."
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.180]   It was intent on maximum exposure.
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:47.820]   It was intent on prolonged exposure, that many of the people who were crucified in their
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:53.620]   day, they would hang there and then they were left to die for days.
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:57.100]   And even if they died, and even if their soul had left, their bodies would there, so that
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:01.860]   the animals would ravage their bodies, and so people would see and say, "We dare not
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.100]   go against the Roman government.
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:07.940]   We dare not sin against the law of the land."
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:16.020]   But if you remember the physical pain, aside from the embarrassment, aside from the prolonged
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:21.580]   shame that Jesus experienced, there on that cross, the physical pain of our Savior.
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:31.020]   I mean, I just only imagine that as He was walking, everybody was still mocking.
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:35.980]   The soldiers kept punching Him and asking, "You think you're the Messiah?
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:37.220]   Then prophesy.
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:38.220]   Who punched you?"
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.620]   They continued to spit on Him.
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:43.020]   They continued to ridicule Him.
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:49.140]   And once He gets to the cross, they nail His arms, they nail His feet to the cross.
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:55.580]   I don't know exactly 100% how, and as I read the story, there's so many different descriptions
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:48:01.620]   of how actually the nailing happens, whether His feet are bound together and then a big
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:05.020]   nail is just driven, whether it's a platform like the pictures show.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:09.620]   And then I realized, essentially, why there is such a discrepancy on how people are nailed
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.620]   to that, is because it was meant to shame.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.220]   People were crucified in all sorts of sinful fashion.
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.460]   We know that Peter was crucified upside down.
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.820]   We know people have been crucified with their hands completely up.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:27.180]   They were crucified and nailed on that cross, not by way of practicality, but to inflict
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:31.000]   the greatest amount of shame and pain.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:37.360]   We know that His body, as He's nailed on there, because it's so impossible to carry a weight
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.020]   of an individual on just those nails.
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:42.620]   His body would continue to collapse.
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:49.100]   You've heard how there's such a difficulty breathing when your body is stretched out.
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:54.300]   And when your arms are up and your body is stretched, that your lungs have an incredibly
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.860]   difficult time of breathing.
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:01.740]   And especially when your legs are too weak and you cannot hold up your body and your
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:07.740]   body starts to droop, then you would die of suffocation.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:12.660]   Again talking about that story of the testimony of the actor, he would describe how when he
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:17.220]   was lifted up, again, under controlled environment, under controlled circumstances, when they
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.140]   were filming, he was lifted up.
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:23.140]   And when they're on that hill and the wind was blowing and his body was exposed, he said
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.460]   chills ran down his body.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:32.860]   And as he was hung on the cross by ropes and by things that weren't seen, still nonetheless
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:36.900]   the weight of his body actually dislocated his left arm and so much pain was raining
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:39.220]   down they had to drop him.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:42.460]   And once they dropped him, he was breathing too hard and the doctors came and they wanted
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:43.460]   to examine him.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:50.140]   The doctor said even the short amount of exposure that he experienced on there, he had pneumonia.
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:53.020]   This is crazy stuff.
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:50:01.220]   But as I think about this, I want to now speak to all of you more just specifically at your
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.700]   heart.
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:10.420]   When I was reading through the narrative, when I was reading through the story of how
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:18.020]   people kept ridiculing him, I felt that same sentiment rise in me again.
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:22.780]   And I don't know when you read the story of Christ, does it rise in you?
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.300]   There is a frustration in my heart.
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:29.060]   There is an indignation in my heart.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.860]   There is an indignation in my heart towards the people.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:35.540]   You truly have no idea what you're doing.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:38.100]   There's an indignation in my heart towards the soldiers.
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.580]   Stop it.
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:46.060]   Yes, I get it, this man claimed to be the king and you find that ridiculous, but look
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.060]   at what you're doing.
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.060]   The scene is gruesome.
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:51.340]   He's bleeding from every part of his body and he's collapsing.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.340]   Stop it.
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:55.420]   I mean, could it be?
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:59.340]   There are literally thousands and thousands of people in that environment and everybody
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:03.380]   sees him bleeding, but everybody is that hardened?
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:06.580]   What's wrong with you people?
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:09.980]   And then there was an indignation in my heart even.
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:16.940]   My Lord Jesus, you could stop this.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.980]   I read an article.
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:23.920]   There was an individual commentating about this Friday saying, "We see, yes, the suffering
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:28.180]   of our Savior and the intensity of the pain that he endured."
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:32.300]   And that article said, "We shouldn't feel sorry for our Savior.
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.620]   It's not a time just to feel sorry for him."
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:37.740]   But I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:41.860]   I don't know how to describe how I felt when I started to rehearse the story and reread
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.540]   the Gospels.
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.060]   Because that's exactly what I felt.
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:49.980]   I felt sorry for my Savior.
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:55.620]   You endure so long and so intensely and so hard and nobody gets you.
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:59.140]   And nobody is willing to stop and nobody is willing to help.
[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:05.260]   And you truly in this moment are the most alone person ever.
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:08.780]   I wish there was another way.
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:14.740]   And just like you pray to God, I wish there was another way for you to save in another
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:15.740]   fashion.
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:19.940]   Couldn't there have been?
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:20.940]   So what do we do?
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:26.000]   Because I actually was distraught by that.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.940]   We shouldn't feel sorry for our Savior.
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:35.020]   He for the joy set before him did all of this, this lengthy track that we just went on, on
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:38.860]   all the ridicule, all the persecution.
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:40.940]   Jesus was so determined to do it.
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:45.220]   And if by any means I say to him, if I was there, I say to him, "Jesus, there's got to
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.220]   be another way."
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:49.860]   Then I would be just like Peter.
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.580]   So how should I feel?
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.500]   And then I started to think about this.
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:53:02.380]   You know, sometimes we, because of our arrogance and because we think we do no better, we sometimes
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:06.980]   hear of how our parents, our previous generation went to such lengths.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:10.340]   My parents tell me sometimes, my parents lived in the war generation.
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:14.540]   They tell me about times when they ate bark, when they ate tofu and told each other it
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.480]   was meat.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:21.140]   When many of their friends were malnourished or they were small, many of them lost their
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.660]   family, all that kind of stuff.
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:27.260]   And they were in survival mode and so they tell me stories of how they went through such
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:31.060]   lengths and how they, you know, suffered and how they never took breaks and they worked
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:35.020]   so hard and they became, you know, workaholics and all of that kind of stuff.
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:39.260]   And then there was a part of me in my arrogance said, "Well, you could have done it another
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:40.260]   way."
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:43.180]   And maybe even say, "Biblically speaking, you should never neglect your family."
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:50.900]   And all of a sudden I had all these opinions of how my parents should have done it.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:57.820]   But these are the moments when as Scripture say, when we see the kindness of our God,
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.740]   we should be broken.
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:01.340]   We should be humbled.
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:05.540]   We should say, "My God, my God, truly how amazing it is.
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:07.300]   Truly how beautiful it is."
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:11.580]   And the way I interpret this, then this is, is I'm not looking at you saying, "Oh, what
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:12.580]   a pitiful scene."
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:18.180]   I'm looking at all of this as, "Oh my goodness, what an offer my Christ has given me."
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:24.420]   "Oh my goodness, what our parents have given us."
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:28.060]   And feel this level of gratitude in our hearts that goes deep, so deep.
[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:30.060]   It's not just, "Oh, I appreciate you."
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:31.780]   It's not just, "I am thankful."
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:34.380]   It's, "I'm broken.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:37.260]   I'm broken in my soul because you love me to this end."
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:41.660]   When I talk about longsuffering, I am talking about the fact that you did not stop.
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:43.340]   You did not pull short.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:50.260]   You didn't say, "Forget this," but rather to no end, to the very limit, you love those
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:52.700]   who are your own.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:55.480]   And because of that, I am saved.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:57.380]   And I want to speak to every single one of you.
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:02.940]   In any given room, I believe there are categorically different people.
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:07.020]   There are people who believe this and they're broken.
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.300]   There are people who do not believe this.
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:14.820]   And then there are people who are on the fence.
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:21.300]   If you are on the fence, realize that you being on the fence is a decision for you to
[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.500]   be on the fence.
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.580]   And I want to challenge and encourage you.
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:30.100]   This is not somebody, this is not a Savior who has given you a hand, a fellowship and
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.500]   said, "Just take my hand."
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:36.820]   This is not somebody who has just simply opened up their door and said, "Come into my house."
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:40.420]   This is not somebody who is just benevolent to you and said, "I will provide for you a
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:41.420]   meal.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:43.700]   I will provide for you your necessities and your finances."
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:48.060]   This is a Savior who said, "I have broken.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:51.260]   I have shed my blood for you.
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:58.000]   And here is everything that I have for you with no limit."
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.900]   This is the long-suffering Savior who has gone to great intensity and great lengths
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:05.220]   to save you.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:07.740]   It would be rude to reject a hand.
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:12.420]   It would be rude to reject an invitation to someone's home.
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:20.020]   And I am going to tell you, it would be absolutely a cosmic offense for you to hear of the sacrifice
[00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:22.740]   of our Savior and harden your heart.
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:26.460]   Wouldn't it be?
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:28.620]   This is an offer like no other.
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:35.140]   And we have to believe the amazing Savior, the Lord God, has given us in this day such
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:36.940]   an offer to us.
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:37.940]   Amen?
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:48.740]   Let's take a moment to bow our heads and pray.
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:58.020]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you so much because we realize that to a degree, to a
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:07.220]   degree, Lord, that we can never fathom, your patience and love goes so deep.
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:14.540]   To a degree, Father God, that we can never fathom, you have paid the cost to redeem us.
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:21.460]   And so, Father, we want to take this time to agree with you that we are not able, to
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:23.540]   agree with you that we are weak.
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:31.700]   Father God, our arms, our feet, our intellect, our hearts are so weak and altogether stained
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:33.620]   by sin.
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:37.140]   There is nothing we could have done.
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:40.140]   And if it would have been that you would have asked and you would have demanded for us to
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:44.340]   pay for our sins, God, we would be completely undone.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:50.500]   Father, thank you so much that our Savior Jesus Christ has gone to such lengths to do
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:56.220]   what we could not do and to do especially and accomplish that which we so desperately
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:57.220]   needed.
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:02.380]   Father, we want to pray that you would grant us faith to understand the depths of your
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:08.260]   suffering, the depths of which your Scripture says you have become our curse and you have
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:09.820]   paid the penalty that we deserve.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:18.180]   Father, I ask that you would help us not to just simply ascend to that or to simply acknowledge
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:22.580]   that but God, that they would drive deep into our hearts and it would be in the conviction
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:23.580]   of our souls.
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:28.700]   That, Father, it would truly just burn inside of us and cause us to respond to you with
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:36.620]   great love and great affection, causing us ultimately, Father God, to dedicate our entire
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:37.780]   lives to you.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.300]   Lord, we thank you so much.
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:40.660]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:41.180]   Amen.
