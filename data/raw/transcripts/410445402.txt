[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920]   Good evening everybody. Let's begin this Bible study with a word of prayer. Would
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.020]   you please join me in prayer? Our God, we want to give you thanks for your
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.960]   precious Word. And God, we know that Lord, when we think about even Apostle Paul, he
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.880]   was praying for the congregation to be strengthened, to have inner strength from faith. And Father
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.200]   God, we do require that strength as we look into all the instructions and the commands
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.880]   that you have for us. For us, Father God, to follow, to obey, and to abide by all the
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.800]   things that you command us and to give us, Father, requires supernatural strength. And
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.560]   so we pray, Lord, that as you exhort us, as you give to us your Word and instruction,
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.400]   would we, Father God, continue to find our footing and our strength from you. We thank
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:12.280]   you, Lord Jesus Christ, and we pray. Amen. Okay. Well, we are in a transition section
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.480]   in our study of the book of Ephesians, as chapters 1 through 3 were clearly just, you
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.240]   know, brilliant, or I guess you can say, really majestic, like, doctrine for us to learn about
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.720]   the grace of God and what the Lord has been doing. I typically like to summarize chapters
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.640]   1 through 3 like this, "It's God who elects, it's God who saves, and it's God who builds."
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.240]   Right? It was--so much of it was just thinking about the ramifications that it has on us,
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.280]   how God has been enacting His mystery, His plan, His administration of our salvation
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.240]   and redemption over time. And so, what an incredible thing that is for us. And then
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.060]   now we're transitioning into, "And therefore, we need to walk." So let's read our section
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.720]   of the passage together. And the Scripture says this, "Therefore, I, the prisoner of
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.240]   the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.720]   been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience showing tolerance for one another
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.280]   in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace. There
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.480]   is one body and one Spirit, just as also you are called in one hope of your calling, one
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.800]   Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.700]   all and in all." And we're going to stop there. I know in the previous lesson I had wrote
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.000]   up till verse 7, but I think after studying it more closely, it's good for us to pause
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.160]   here. Jumping right into the study, in the very first section or the first verse, we
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.920]   have Apostle Paul giving us this application of command, "Therefore, you need to walk."
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.600]   He says, "I actually implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the call." Let's break
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.560]   that down. I gave you a brief just looking at it in section by section. Now if we were
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.680]   doing a really kind of, I guess you could say, detailed attention study to this, we
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.280]   could literally break up each one and study it. What we're going to do is more so just
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.160]   overview it, right? Now, because we've been doing the study and last time I did essentially
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.880]   kind of like a review, I'm not going to review chapters 1-3, but here when he says, "Therefore,
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.480]   I the prisoner of the Lord," he has in mind all that's being built up in terms of God's
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.760]   plan. I made much of it the last study that Apostle Paul has in his mind the glory of
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.800]   God as it pertains to his masterful plan for his church, right? And when you think about
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.640]   all that, yes, it's inclusive then of Jews and Gentiles coming together. It's inclusive
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.400]   of our individual salvation, but also it's inclusive of our corporate, what that means
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.880]   at the ramification for the church at large. I believe he has all that in mind, but the
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:15.760]   important thing is he implores a walk that is worthy of all that. So here, just taking
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.680]   a look at that first section, he says, "I implore you." Okay, the term really just means
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.080]   to urge, but in other portions of Scripture it's translated, "I exhort you," right? "I
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.320]   challenge or strengthen." Now, to add the oomph, so to speak, to add the emphasis to
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.880]   that, Apostle Paul begins with essentially his authority, but in a unique way where he
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.720]   says, "I, the prisoner of the Lord." And when he does that, you kind of wonder, like, in
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.080]   certain moments when somebody gives a strong exhortation or commands you to do something,
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.080]   sometimes we could have a reaction where we kind of wonder, like, "Do you know who you're
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.400]   talking to?" Or more so maybe, "Do you even understand the struggle of trying to do something?"
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.880]   Right? And essentially, Apostle Paul literally and spiritually says, "I am the prisoner of
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:11.000]   the Lord," which shows both his experience in doing the very thing that he's commanding,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.080]   but also in many ways the authority of which he's commanding with, right? And we also take
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.840]   a moment to think about this. I have this little sentence here, it says, "As good children,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.760]   we should listen well to both doctrine and instruction." And the reason why I wrote that
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.720]   is because whenever we move into a section that's highly applicational, and there's lots
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.120]   of commands that are going to come one by one, we take a moment to kind of reflect,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.560]   like, "Are we ready for this?" Right? If we're not ready, then we're gonna just do exactly
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.680]   what I just described. Like, "What? Where is this coming from? Do you even know how hard
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.480]   it is? Do you know how much I've already tried? Are you not appreciating how much blood and
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.600]   sweat I've already put into walking like a Christian?" Right? Like, if we're not ready
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.560]   for the instruction, that's how we're going to feel. But if we are ready for it because
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.240]   we've been paying attention, we've been listening, then we're going to be all the more receptive.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.320]   What's unfortunate is in our modern church history, in recent times, when there was the
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.520]   hyper grace, kind of like, "You don't preach imperatives, you just really have to keep
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.120]   preaching the gospel, and the imperatives will eventually come, you don't even need
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.720]   to mention it almost." But that doesn't show this receptiveness. Like, you really understood,
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.160]   and therefore you're ready for the application, right? But that's what I'm going to challenge
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:35.720]   us to do. In some circles, it wasn't even kosher to give an urge, right? To give an
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:42.200]   exhortation. But for us, we actually should be receptive of it because we've been listening.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.640]   And so what I'm saying is, in maturity, we should have been listening well to chapters
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:51.880]   1 through 3, and what we should be doing is saying yes to both. Yes to the doctrine, yes
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.120]   to the instruction, and although some of us, maybe we love the doctrinal, right? We love
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.760]   the doctrinal, we love talking theology, but when it comes to application, it's kind of
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.280]   like, "You're not willing to go more forward." This should be a challenge to you. Both are
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.440]   required of us. On the flip side, there have been times when people love the practical.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.680]   They love action. They want to produce something. They want to be a part of a movement, so to
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.360]   speak. But when it comes to doctrine, and why, and the theology behind it, it feels
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:28.720]   so dry. But as for us, again, it's absolutely important for us to know. A huge part of God's
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.880]   Word to us is we're supposed to remember, we're supposed to understand, and we're supposed
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:39.160]   to know Him. And we have to think accurately and intimately about God. But also then, we
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.920]   have to apply, and so again, this is just a quick early exhortation that there's a requirement
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.280]   for us to have a balance of both. That when we're doing our Bible study, I hope we're
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.600]   not looking at the scripture as kind of like, "And how does that matter?" But also, we shouldn't
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:00.040]   be looking at it as like, "That's nice, and I'm just simply admiring." Now, next portion
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:07.200]   of it, the passage talks about this important concept, a broad concept, that our walk should
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.800]   be in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called. Now, truthfully,
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.720]   when I think about this term, "manner worthy," instinctually, I know, I think I know and
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.600]   I understand. But then, when you take a moment to pause, honestly, something doesn't sound
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.640]   right. It feels weird, right, to say, "Walk in a manner worthy of this calling," because
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:34.440]   truthfully, how can we? And what's more, worthy? Like, in what way are we worthy of anything?
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.280]   You know, what way are we worthy of God, or His call, or the path that He has set for
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.600]   us, right? And what's more, if you think about the English definition of the term "worthy,"
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.720]   I looked it up, and it says, "Having qualities and abilities that merit recognition." Okay,
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:56.280]   so the times that the idea of worth is being used, essentially, you're worth your position,
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.680]   or you have the merit to hold your position. Or we even have idioms that say, like, "A
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:07.880]   man is worthy of his wage." Essentially, his work is deserving of that kind of pay.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.880]   Now, when you think about the way that he's using this, obviously, he's not using it in
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:19.840]   a means of, like, "By your work, you're going to merit some kind of pay." What he's talking
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:27.160]   about, actually, is reverse. What he's saying is, you have this call. You essentially believe
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:33.400]   in God's plan and mystery. And you must therefore live worthy of it, meaning, the more biblical
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:42.000]   idea is, worthy is the Greek term axios. And that means worthy, or suitably, or properly.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.760]   There is a one-to-one match. As a matter of fact, that term then was used, yes, as a scale.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.520]   Essentially, you should be thinking about something in balance. Something essentially
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.520]   is consistent. And that's the intuitive terms, intuitive understanding that we get, and that's
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.640]   pretty much the way Scripture uses it through various different contexts. There are so many
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.600]   times in the Bible, and I have those cross-references for you there that you can look up in your
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.840]   own time, where the challenge is, you know what's been done for you. You know who he
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:20.120]   is. You know who you are. You know what he's doing with you. Therefore, be consistent.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.800]   Therefore be. You need to actually practice what you believe. The consistency for us,
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:35.200]   from going from God's command, our belief, our faith, is called into action. Right? And
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:41.720]   so then, when we think about this, there is a huge challenge. For a lot of us, it does
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.080]   have to go into this pattern where we first have to know why. We first have to have the
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.600]   motivation, and we first have to have the foundation. However, if we do not move from
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:11:00.160]   there to then walking in a manner that's consistent, then our lives become sarcastic. It becomes
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:10.200]   hypothetical. Right? It becomes like, if somebody says like, "Oh my goodness, it's so scary
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.400]   being out there." And then you say, "It's pretty scary." And then you end up going out
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.040]   there, what ends up happening is your words become pretty sarcastic. Like it could be
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.020]   taken that way. And the reason why I use that example is because we believe that we should
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:30.840]   be fearing God. And if our words are simply, "I do fear God. He's pretty scary." And then
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.560]   yet you do every single thing that communicates that you're not afraid of Him, your words
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:42.000]   almost become sarcastic to God. Right? And so whenever we think of our action and our
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   words in relation to the Lord, we really have to be careful. Our yes is yes, our no is no,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.920]   and all those consistencies matter. Why? Because it really reveals what we believe about the
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:02.720]   Lord. Okay. So in summary of that first point, it's our life as being fitting, is being consistent
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.240]   to the righteousness, truth, and love that we have received, the gospel we have received.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:15.280]   Okay. Moving to the second point. Apostle Paul, in his challenge now, and saying, "I
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:24.760]   essentially implore you to walk in a manner worthy of a calling," he says that it should
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:31.200]   be done with certain character trait and manner. Okay. So he says, "With all humility and gentleness,
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.820]   with patience, showing tolerance for one another, and love, being diligent to preserve the unity
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:44.340]   of the spirit and the bond of peace." Okay. Now, again, we could just pause here and do
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:49.960]   a full one hour study of just these two verses, verse two and three. But what we're going
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.080]   to just do is walk through these character traits and the manners. And the way I like
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.240]   to do this is because in verse one, Apostle Paul said, "I want you to walk in a manner
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.960]   that's worthy." Let's take a moment to think about these character traits, the humility,
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:11.320]   the gentleness, and so forth, in a kind of evaluative way where we ask the question,
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:16.360]   "Is this pattern worthy of the gospel? Is it worthy of what we believe?" What I mean
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:22.260]   by this is, let's take a list of all these things, all humility, gentleness, and patience,
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.520]   and ask the question, "Is it consistent to what we believe in Christ and the things that
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.160]   we've been taught in chapters one through three?" Let's first think about humility.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:38.660]   Okay. Humility. Now, when we think about humility, a lot of times it's just to think like you're
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:45.360]   not -- a lot of times people describe humility in a negative term, meaning you're not bombastic,
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   you know, you're not all like pomp, and you're not all about bragging, okay? Something like
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:55.080]   that. Or you're not all about thinking that you're the best, right? And essentially, yeah,
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:02.640]   humility is to think properly. That comparison to you and God, you're tiny. God is massively,
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.520]   infinitely huge, and you're just a finite being, right? You're tiny. That, in a sense,
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:13.140]   is humility. But when we think about the opposite side, again, in contrast, we realize that
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:21.840]   living in pride is absolutely unworthy of God. What do I mean? Okay. If I believe, according
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:28.200]   to the book of Ephesians, that I was dead, completely dead in my transgressions, and
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   what's more, I was super far from God. I wasn't even close. I wasn't even as close as the
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:40.960]   people of the Hebrews, right? And yet, and yet I currently now think I deserve a lot
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:48.420]   more. And yet I think, like, where are my rights? It's inconsistent. To know that I'm
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:53.120]   in transgression, like the rest, like everybody else, to know that I was in such -- to say
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.800]   that I'm in transgression is I was out of line, and I was wrong, but my normal way of
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.360]   speech is, "You're wrong, you're wrong, and you're wrong." Right? "You're unfair, you're
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:08.040]   not righteous, everybody else is to blame but me." That kind of self-preservation is
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:13.580]   absolutely unworthy of God. It's unworthy because that kind of self-preservation continues
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:18.520]   to preserve the flesh, and it does not preserve Christ. It does not preserve the truth that
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.840]   we've been told, and that now we believe in. That kind of pride, again, is unworthy. What's
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:31.480]   more, that's a self-preserving pride, okay? Self-preserving pride. What's more, if I believe,
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:37.040]   according to Ephesians 2, that I have been saved apart from my works, it is by the grace
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:44.400]   of God, and it's not my deeds, it's not because of the things I have done, and yet, and yet,
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.860]   my ambition is, "Look at what I've done!" Right? "Look at my success!" And yet, my regular
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:56.120]   pattern of speech is, "Compared to you, I've done so much more!" Right? Completely inconsistent.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:03.600]   It's unworthy of the kind of gospel we have received. Why? Because that kind of self-exalting
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:09.760]   pride promotes our vanity rather than Christ. Let me repeat that. Anytime we're sitting
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:16.160]   there proud, proud that we're not like those lowly ones, or in comparison that we're somehow
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:22.960]   better, and we believe we're better, or more significant, it completely exalts our vanity,
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:29.920]   and it does not exalt Christ. It's unworthy of Christ. And so, ultimately, pride and all
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.680]   its selfishness, self-preserving, self-promotion, all of that, it's unworthy of the reality
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:41.560]   we believe. And so, the definition of humility actually is an accurate view of God and His
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:49.680]   reality. In humility, you're always vulnerable to truth. When reality and truth hits you,
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.520]   your humility allows you to receive it and believe it. It's consistent with it. The grand
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:17:01.240]   worldview of God shows us who we are. And so, a passage I want to highlight to you is
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.400]   Philippians. Philippians 2. Remember that in Philippians 2, 3, Scripture tells us that
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:11.540]   without empty conceit, but rather with humility of mind, we are to regard others more important
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:18.240]   than yourself. Okay? And again, a valid question to you then, I just tried to give some ways
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.760]   and patterns of speech. I just tried to give some ways and patterns that we think. Are
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.000]   your thoughts and is your speech consistent with what we profess to believe, even in chapters
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.760]   1 through 2 of Ephesians? Okay? 1 through 3 of Ephesians. What's more, he says, "with
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.160]   all gentleness." Okay, so all humility and gentleness, he says. Now, it's really closely
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:47.840]   tied with humility. Gentleness, the most common Greek word for that is "proutess." And it's
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:54.760]   most commonly translated as gentleness. It's also translated sometimes as meekness or humility.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.720]   So there seems to be some kind of overlap there. Now, when we think about this though,
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:05.820]   when we think about the term gentleness, it is used in not just simply, "Oh, I'm humble."
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:11.160]   But in a way where you're not reactive. Where essentially in your quick temper, your reactions
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.800]   are overly harsh. Okay? So in that way, are you gentle? I want to ask a question. Are
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:24.480]   you approachable? Now, when in terms of what we believe, we believe that God has been gentle
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:30.480]   with us. In the sense that, all we've learned about in Ephesians chapter 1 through 3, is
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:39.880]   that God has kind intention, lavishing intentions to save, to cause us to be blameless and holy.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:47.160]   Okay? He has a very purposeful and intentional dealing with us. I mean, if you look at the
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.240]   scope of what Apostle Paul said in the salvation plan of God, can we sit there and be like,
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.240]   "Oh my gosh, so harsh." Right? He overreacted. Like, is that what we're going to be able
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:02.680]   to say and judge God? No. The complete opposite. What's more, we read of Christ. I have this
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.680]   picture of a lion and a lamb. Because Christ is described this way when Christ said to
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.920]   us, or the disciples, "Come to me all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:19.200]   you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me. For I am gentle," which is the same
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:27.220]   word here, "and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls." Wow. I think about
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:35.080]   that and I think about the character of Christ. We are saying that I have seen the kindness
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:41.880]   of God. I have seen God's intentional purpose. I have seen the work of God. Like that's what
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:49.680]   Apostle Paul is highlighting. I've seen the intentional work of God. Right? But, for us
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:57.160]   then to have this kind of eruptive attitude where we respond to stuff where we can, you
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:03.000]   know, again, the inconsistency for us to say, "My Savior has been gentle with me. I know
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.680]   that I was a child of wrath. I know that I was supposed to be." God could have, and then
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:16.160]   another way to put it is God should have punished me. Then and there. I believe that. And I
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:21.680]   believe rather than doing that, God has been so kind and gentle. But what in the world
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:28.520]   is wrong with you? It's so inconsistent if we work like that. And so I want to give just
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.280]   a quick encouragement. Kind of an encouragement that I recall back when I was in seminary.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.440]   One of my professors, Dr. John Street, would always say, and this he would always say to
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:44.080]   the men, the husbands. And he said, "Husbands, Scripture actually calls us to live in an
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:49.280]   understanding way." Right? And I think all of that contributes to this idea of gentleness.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:54.080]   And he would always say, "They are like fine china, beautiful silverware that you're supposed
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:21:00.960]   to hold. Not so loosely and weakly that you drop it, but not so harshly that you break
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.880]   it with your own hands." And then he would rebuke and say, "Some of you guys, rather
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:09.080]   than treating your wives like fine china and beautiful silverware, you treat them like
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:14.280]   tupperware." Right? The idea is, do you have that kind of control? Do you have that kind
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.320]   of intentionality? And I think that's important for us. The reason why I picked this picture
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:25.280]   of the lion and the lamb is because Christ has that unique element where one person might
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:30.560]   think you're supposed to be this like doormat where you're always taking the backseat and
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:36.920]   yielding. But the concept actually is not like that at all. The concept more so, in
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:43.280]   one of the kind of word studies of the New Testament defined it like this. It says that
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.920]   you are able to maintain a posture. So the idea is you're in control, you're able to
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.820]   maintain a posture before God and before circumstances where you can submit to whatever the Lord
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:22:00.520]   gives you. Okay? That's kind of an extensive definition. But what I'm trying to describe
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:06.360]   is it's not the wrong idea of somebody who's just super weak. It is definitely not the
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:11.520]   idea of some that we're supposed to avoid is the idea of somebody who is overly harsh.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:17.160]   But I kind of think about a surgeon, right? If you're super harsh, then essentially you're
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:23.040]   going to cut too much. If you're super weak and you're not skilled in your surgery, you're
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.520]   just going to cut often. You're going to have to repeat the process. Question to you, are
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:33.000]   you gentle? When you're not overly harsh and cutting way too deep and too much, but at
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.760]   the same time you're intentional and you're able to actually help. Right? Okay. Moving
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:44.640]   to the next thing, patience and tolerance and love. I put those things together because
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.840]   after the study of the terms, they're really similar. Patience comes from the term macro
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:55.760]   through mia. Okay. And taking literally, it means long suffering. Tolerance, it comes
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:03.320]   from the term anexo my, which means enduring, okay. Enduring difficulty. And so essentially
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:10.280]   the idea has this mentality where it's like, you're supposed to be able to absorb the wrong
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:16.680]   done to you. And actually within both first Timothy and Titus, when it describes descriptions
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:23.980]   of leaders, it says, are you able to endure when wronged? Right. And I think that's something
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:28.240]   really interesting because Proverbs chapter 10 verse 12 describes an individual who is
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:35.400]   wise, who is able to have a heart that covers up all transgressions. Okay. If you're an
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:42.760]   individual where you are so bothered by the offense, and again, confession, right? When
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:47.480]   certain offenses just really, really boil within you and you can't overcome it. And
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.080]   sometimes those offenses aren't even sins. It's just like annoyances. You just, people
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:58.800]   get on your nerve and tolerating and bearing with them. ESV translates this passage, the
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:04.360]   idea of bearing, sorry, tolerance, it translates bearing with somebody, right? Some of us aren't
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.640]   even able to do that. And some of us are more inclined like, well, you know what, if you're
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.600]   going to offend me or you're going to attack me, the best defense is offense. And then
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:19.040]   so you go and you turn that around as an opportunity to hurt the other individual, right? But scripture
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:26.400]   is actually challenging us, no. Remember we were talking about consistency. The consistency
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:33.040]   of what we say we're believing, right? I mean, we are talking about how in Ephesians chapter
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:41.000]   three, that Christ took away with the enmity. There was hostility. We were hostile against
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.720]   God. Well, we didn't want his kind of authority and rule in our lives. And what's more, his
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:52.200]   law then, because of our hostility, because of our transgression, is hostile against us.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:25:00.080]   And there was this huge divide. Christ absorbed all that. And for us to be like, uh-uh, I
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:05.080]   will not stand for disrespect, right? And some of us are really sensitive. If something,
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:10.640]   a word they say remotely sounds like you're patronizing me, like you're diminishing my
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:16.440]   importance or you're not even thinking of me, we're like, uh-uh, I'm standing for this,
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:23.800]   right? The scripture actually calls us to a higher ethic, okay? Yes, is it true that
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:29.000]   let's say for parenting, you have to teach your children to abide by authority? Yes.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.360]   Should you be allowing people to walk all over you? No. But there is an intentionality.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:42.920]   There is a gentleness that's built up in all this, accumulating to love. That your love
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:50.440]   is able to actually cover a multitude of sins, right? And what's more, we are the ones who
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:56.760]   are saying we believe that God has long suffered with us, with mankind for generations. For
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:02.520]   us personally, I mean, we can sit and talk about disappointing, you know, God disappointing
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:08.040]   us because life is hard or we have some troubles and we've hit some really rough times. We
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:12.880]   have to flip that around sometimes and ask how many times have we disappointed God? And
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:19.520]   why does God have to long suffer with us? Why does He even have to bear? Why does He
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:27.080]   even have to wait? Why does God of the universe have to even wait for mankind to do anything?
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:32.920]   He doesn't. Absolutely not. And we've been learning in this past chapters 1 through 3,
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:42.000]   the amazing grace of God, right? To even involve us, to even desire for us to respond to His
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.280]   love. It's been crazy, right? And so, if ever we have this temptation in our hearts
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:52.440]   to say, "Well you know what? You're frustrating. Say what you need to say. How come you're
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:58.040]   not saying this? And communicating with you is tough and blah blah blah blah blah." Right?
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:03.760]   That's inconsistent. What I mean is, sometimes we're tempted to essentially write off people
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.160]   and say, "Forget you then." Right? And at that moment, we are inconsistent with what
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:14.960]   we're saying we believe. So, every single one of us, I'm sure, we want to grow in patience
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:20.480]   and long-suffering. And these attitudes, these are the attitudes that are going to build
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:27.480]   the unity that God desires. Verse 3 says this, okay? The third point is you need character
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:34.640]   to build unity. And verse 3 says this, "Being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:43.300]   in the bond of peace." Okay? Now, real quickly here. The reason why I separated being diligent
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:49.880]   from the others is because the others described these character traits, right? That are like
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:55.680]   humility and patience and things that we're all growing in. But being diligent is a participle.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:02.320]   Right? What I mean by participle is the whole idea of like the running, walking, right?
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:13.080]   Basically, it's an ongoing action. And so, just as a quick definition and also an encouragement,
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.800]   being diligent means that you're showing your eagerness. You're showing your effort. You're
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:23.120]   showing your earnestness. Right? And so, let's say hypothetically we have this conversation
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:28.280]   and we were telling this young man who is just like grew up staying at home and just
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.400]   feels more comfortable being left alone. And basically, you know, you encourage the guy
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.800]   and you say, "Hey man, let's really fellowship and get together and try to connect." And
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:42.000]   he's like, "Oh man, I mean I've tried before and it's just not working." You know? Like
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   you try and people don't reciprocate. Okay? What I'm gonna do is get all nerdy and be
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   like, "But remember it was a present participle." Present meaning now. You tried, but are you
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.560]   trying? Okay? What's more, it's a participle in the sense that it doesn't give you a parameter
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:04.200]   that the whole idea is you're being humble, patient, all that kind of stuff. All of that
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:09.640]   showing your earnestness to produce unity of the spirit or to preserve it. Right? So,
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:14.840]   the idea is I would ask then, "Hey, it's a good thing for you to just acknowledge, well,
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.880]   I should be trying and then to take go above that. What steps are you showing to show your
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:27.240]   effort and earnestness in preserving this? Why? Because this unity is worthy of being
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:33.680]   preserved. What do I mean? In the next point, in thinking about to preserve the unity in
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:42.760]   the bond of peace, I want to highlight something for you. Christ, God, the spirit, the triune
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:50.040]   Lord has designed and wanted this unity. And Christ specifically prayed for it and then
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:56.680]   it was accomplished and therefore it is worthy of our efforts to preserve it. What do I mean?
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:02.120]   John chapter 17 in Christ's high priestly prayer, he says, "I am no longer in the world
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.920]   and yet they themselves are in the world and I come to you." He is praying to God Father.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:11.080]   "Holy Father, keep them in your name and the name which you have given me that they
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:19.200]   may be one even as we are." Christ uses the unity that he has with his Father and
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:25.760]   prays. This is one of the purposes of which we are doing this, is that we may be one.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:30.560]   Verse 22, "The glory which you have given me I have given to them that they may be one
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.400]   just as we are one. I in them, you in me, that they may be perfected in unity so that
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:42.200]   the world may know that you sent me and love them even as you have loved me." This is
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:47.440]   a passage I've referenced a couple times actually in our study through Ephesians, I think twice.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:54.040]   Because it's so significant that the unity that Christ again wanted, prayed for, then
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:31:00.960]   accomplished highlights and presents God's grace and love. Because remember in Ephesians
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:07.320]   chapter 1-3 we learned that this is a grand purpose of God, to exalt himself, to show
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:14.160]   us his glory of how extensive his love is. And what's more, God commands us in Philippians
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:19.960]   chapter 2 verses 1-5, connecting our doctrines and our application. Therefore, if there is
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:25.160]   any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:30.800]   of the Spirit, if any affection, compassion, make my joy complete by being of the same
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:36.500]   mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. Do nothing
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:41.400]   from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:46.280]   important than yourselves. Do not merely look out for your own personal interest, but also
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:54.240]   for the interests of others. Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:00.320]   So as we take a look at that, what a challenge to us. That the unity that God desires within
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:07.820]   the church, God desires us to do by what Christ has already prayed for and established. God
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:14.780]   has given us the bond of peace is what I'm saying. And so, if sometimes you presume that
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:20.320]   certain characters and personalities in the church just don't mix. Perhaps sometimes you
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:26.160]   presume that there just aren't enough commonalities for us to get together and really hang out.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:31.840]   Perhaps you presume that your Myers-Briggs letters, INTJ or whatever it may be, just
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:38.680]   does not match yours. Let me tell you, the basis for our peace, the basis for our unity,
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:45.280]   the basis for our fellowship was never some letters. It wasn't some treaties or it wasn't
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:51.320]   some contract you and I signed. It's the bond of peace that Christ has made. And if it so
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.600]   happens that we happen to be of similar age and if it so happens that we happen to have
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:04.520]   similar interests, nice! But it's just nice. We have something so much greater. And if
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:08.800]   ever you've clashed with somebody in the church and you've written them off and you said,
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:15.180]   "You know what? It's better that we're just far apart." Can I remind you, that's not something
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:24.280]   for you to determine. Right? If you are participating within this body and let's say you had this
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:29.280]   experience where you clashed with somebody and you decide, "You know what? Let's just
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:36.800]   stay far away." Or, "That's just never going to work." I know that sometimes that's a temptation
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:41.240]   to think that because even in the realm of marriages, that may happen. Two people who
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:47.120]   love each other made a covenant pact together may one day almost feel like, "Oh my goodness!
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:53.320]   You and I are like, you know, oil and water we just don't mix." But that's not something
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.920]   a conclusion you're allowed to make within this household. Why? Because you're not the
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:03.520]   father. God has said, "I have built this church and I'm making it my dwelling place." It is
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:10.640]   a spiritual family of God. And He has given us a bond of peace that supersedes whatever
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:16.400]   experiences, personal clashes that we have. The differences that we have, yes, they may
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:22.520]   be difficult. The differences that we have, yes, may be really evident. But just remember
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:27.760]   the context of this application in what God has already taught us in chapters 1-3. And
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.780]   therefore that context we have to highlight now. Apostle Paul reminds us of the context
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.840]   by giving us a boom, boom, boom, boom, boom list of how much we have because that's how
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:45.200]   he started it. You're so blessed. Blessed be God who has blessed you with everything.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:51.040]   He's blessed you with everything. And so he says, "There is one body, one spirit, just
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:56.080]   as also you were called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:01.160]   one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all." Okay, as you
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:07.160]   look at this list I highlighted for you the term "one" because he repeats it seven times.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:11.880]   Which is the number of typically perfection. I don't want to make too much of it, but man,
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:18.040]   what an emphatic little section here. This is the ground upon which we walk, as he's
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:23.040]   commanding us to walk, and the ground upon which we build the unity or preserve the unity
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:28.440]   that God has given us. The theme is oneness. MacArthur, John MacArthur comments on this
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:34.740]   and says this, "This passage shows us that the foundation of our practical unity and
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:39.960]   how we are to apply this is our spiritual oneness. Every application, every practical
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:45.120]   unity that people long for, that people believe is powerful for us, comes out of the inner
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:50.240]   oneness of God." Okay, and the way I like to put it is when you look at this passage,
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.800]   I ask, "Is there a theme going on here?" There kind of is. And the theme essentially
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:02.400]   is you have all that you need for unity to be truly one. Why? Because you are in all
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:08.840]   of God. Or another way to put it is you have all of God. You have what God has given us
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:16.960]   through his triune self. Christ prayed for that. He's there. The triune God is there.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:22.360]   There is one body and one spirit. There's one Lord, Jesus Christ, and one God, Father
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:27.440]   of all. Right? And essentially that's what he's saying at the very end of it. Who is
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:33.800]   overall, the Father of all, who is overall through all and in all. And therefore then,
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:41.840]   as we have this theme, I want to kind of wrap things up by thinking about how does this
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:47.420]   build for us that foundation we're supposed to walk on to walking unity and oneness of
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:53.640]   spirit together as a church. Because that's so important, right? Well, another passage
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:37:02.880]   that summarizes this concept is 1 Corinthians chapter 12, verse 13 and 20. It says, "For
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:08.280]   by one spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:15.000]   or free, and we were all made to drink of one spirit. There are many members, but one
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.040]   body." Okay? So I want you to notice something there. He says, "Whether you're Jews or
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:26.960]   Greeks, slaves or free." Okay? Other parts of Scripture it says, "There's no male or
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:33.160]   female here." Right? There's no, you know, Jew or Greek. There's no slave or free. I
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:39.800]   mean think about the social categories. If there ever were dividing social categories,
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:43.040]   those things would really separate people, right? I mean you have people who are like
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:48.720]   masters and lords and then people who are property. You have people on incredibly opposite
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.920]   sides of the spectrum on the social status. What they're even capable of, the circles
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:57.520]   that they're supposed to run around in and what they're even capable of doing. Some of
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:02.920]   these individuals, remember, between Jews and Greeks in the sanctuary, there was an
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:07.640]   inner court and an outer court. Women and the Gentiles weren't even allowed in this
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:13.440]   in this center part, right? So I want you to think about that. Now, I want you to think
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:20.400]   about cultural things that bring us together and then I want you to think this, okay? When
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.680]   the Scriptures talks about the spirit that we have one spirit, think about this that
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:31.360]   we have through the spirit a new birth. We have been called by God to be a new man. Through
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   the spirit we are born again, which means we are then, we have the same origin. We are
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:43.360]   then by origin united. What's more, Scripture talks about that we are this body. There's
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:49.320]   just one body. This is our identity. Why? Because we are the body of Christ and he has
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:54.640]   descriptions that then we organically coming together, we all play a part and there's a
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:01.440]   purposeful architectural and intentional orchestrating this thing together by God. And so therein
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:07.040]   lies our identity. We have the same hope, which is essentially our purpose. Our purpose
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.200]   is the glory of God. Right now we exalt the glory of God and the exaltation of Christ
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:18.600]   in his gospel in the future glory by seeing Christ exalted in him coming for us. Right?
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:23.360]   What's more, sorry I keep pressing next but it's all right there. Okay, what's more? We
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   have the same Lord. We are by governance united. Think about this, people they feel the sense
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:36.120]   of I mean go to a soccer game where it's not just like the galaxy and the this and that
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:41.000]   team the sparks or whatever but it you know if you ever go to a soccer game where it's
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.880]   national, national games right? We have let's say Chile and people are just singing like
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:53.360]   ole ole ole ole right? Chile. And then you have you know the kind of like solidarity
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:59.280]   in that. But think about this, I mean we have one king. That means we are we're a part of
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:08.120]   the same kingdom. We're governed by the same majestic, gracious, righteous God who's powerful.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:13.280]   That's amazing. What's more, we're united by belief. We have this one faith. We believe
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:19.280]   in the same truth and that truth has opened our eyes and all of that leads to the same
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:24.200]   experience. We have been baptized into one baptism. The greatest story, the greatest
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:30.520]   drama we've all experienced. There's going to be then a mutual kind of, man remember
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:37.440]   when we were before and right? We're running around so lost in the dark. We have the same
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:44.440]   story. I mean think about how much we have in common. And what then happens is when we
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:50.080]   recognize that we have all this gracious you know elements that we have been afforded by
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:57.840]   God held in common by the church. The church should have a multifaceted unity, a culture
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:03.120]   of unity in Christ. The reason why I say culture is because culture it's typically built up
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.800]   of your practice, your belief, your customs, your posture, like all that kind of stuff.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:13.760]   Your mutual understanding, all that kind of stuff built to a culture. And I pray and hope
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:20.880]   that our culture is built on that common spiritual ground. Please do not come in here and request
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:28.480]   that our culture be built on anything else. Whether it be sports, whether it be our ethnicity.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:33.440]   Don't ask for that. Why? Because if it's not unity in Christ we're going to have the wrong
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.840]   culture. If it's not the character and righteousness of Christ we're not going to have the bond
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:44.240]   of peace and therefore it's not going to be the right culture. The community aspect of
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:52.200]   this. It has to be built here. And the question I have for you is looking at this list, why
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:59.000]   do we sometimes talk and act like we don't have much in common? Right? It's like sometimes
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:07.440]   we walk into a scenario or rumors like, "I feel so out of place." Why? Why do you walk
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:15.240]   into a church group at our own building and feel so out of place? And we know why. I mean
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:21.800]   I know I'm asking almost like an annoyed way. I do this sometimes, right? Because you're
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:26.840]   afraid on a superficial humanistic what you see with your eye level you're not the same
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:33.640]   as everybody else. But this is where we too have to continue to practice our faith. We
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:38.040]   shouldn't walk into a room, let's say there's somebody across the room who's 65 years old
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.800]   who have children my age. I shouldn't sit there and think like, "Well what am I supposed
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:47.840]   to talk about?" We have the same origin, identity, purpose, governance, belief, experience, and
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:56.200]   culture. We've got stuff to talk about. We have an opportunity for fellowship. You know
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:01.200]   I watched this interesting interview and disclaimer it's a little political here. A news reporter
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:08.160]   who's clearly conservative was asking a young black Muslim girl who is demanding repayment
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:14.160]   for slavery from the government and also establishment of safe zone cities. If you guys don't know
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:18.760]   what all that is you guys could probably look it up. Safe zone cities, safe spaces, and
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:25.440]   repayment for slavery that happened a while ago. And the reporter asked, "Don't you think
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:30.720]   you're going a little overboard? You are asking for stuff which within your mind and your
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:36.260]   perspective makes sense but none of this applies to every American citizen. You can't apply
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:42.560]   this to every American citizen." And the reporter asked, "You're a citizen like everybody else."
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:49.600]   And the girl responded, "Look I'm first a black female Muslim American but in that order."
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:57.520]   And the reporter said, "Oh I see but we have a problem." Now the reason why I point this
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:05.360]   out is because you and I exercise a priority in our identity in our mind. We have a worldview
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:10.640]   by which certain things take precedence. We have a worldview where certain things matter.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.440]   We don't sometimes intentionally put it there but that's how we've operated. And for a young
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:21.400]   girl she has certain identity portions that are completely first tier priority for her
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:25.560]   and therefore when asked the question, "What about your general citizenship?" She says,
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:35.960]   "That's last on the podium for us." We have to think about this and say, "You, whether
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:44.200]   it's culturally, identity, all that stuff. You are first of Christ. You have one God
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:51.760]   and Father and everything else you just happen to be. Your first and foremost priority identity
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:45:00.680]   is of Christ and everything is a far far second." And so Apostle Paul is pointing to this. If
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:09.360]   you understood chapters 1 through 3, we have incredible foundation for unity. We have everything
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:16.600]   as we abide in Christ to belong to the family of God as God is building up that household.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:22.440]   To keep the unity of faith is a worthy cause and that is the proper worldview. You know
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:27.400]   I was so challenged that a lot of commentators mentioned, "Think about every treaty that
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:32.240]   has been made in history between nations and countries. How many of those percentage wise
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:37.380]   do you think have been kept where neither parties you know made any kind of infractions
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:45.000]   and transgress the stipulations of those treaties?" Very few. No treaty, no mutually beneficial
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:52.600]   agreement or contract is going to do and provide for us the kind of powerful unity and oneness
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:59.960]   that we know is so precious, is so pleasing to God and also beneficial for us. It's sweet
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:09.040]   for us. It's lovely. It's amazing. Nothing on earth is going to produce that. Only the
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:14.600]   power of Christ. Only the power of the Spirit. And so with that I want to conclude by saying
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:20.840]   man Pastor Peter's sermon this past Sunday when he was talking about Christ as the light
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:27.800]   and essentially is the way. He's lighting the direction and the way for us. We are all
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:33.300]   on the exact same path so actually beyond even this passage we could talk about so much
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:38.480]   more. Let's make sure that we're focused on the right kind, the right source, and the
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:44.480]   right result of the unity that God has for us because ultimately all of that is going
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:51.520]   to be pleasing to him. Let's take a moment to pray. Heavenly Father we thank you so much
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:47:00.920]   for your grace. God, we're to think that our Savior is praying for us and that long ago
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:08.760]   before we even existed of course he knew. And God his kind intention has been then meticulously
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:15.320]   over such a long time. We can't even trace it ourselves because our minds are so limited.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:22.480]   All that Lord God we just thank you and we're amazed. But now Lord we're challenged to go
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:28.640]   beyond our comfort zones. For those of us Father God I just feel sometimes weak to go
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:34.320]   out and take initiative and all that stuff. We recognize that's not done because it just
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:39.880]   happens to be to be good. But Lord it's done because it's glorious to you. Because you're
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:45.440]   pleased by it. Because Father God you're honored when in your name and on the foundation of
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:51.040]   Christ we're able to love like Christ. For all of that God we thank you. We thank you
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.760]   Lord Jesus Christ and we pray. Amen.
