[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.400]   Alright, we're going to be looking at Leviticus chapter 24 today.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.360]   Just a reminder, next week all the leaders are headed out to the gospel coalition for
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.420]   the conference, so we don't have a normal Bible study.
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.440]   You may have been contacted or at least talked to your small groups.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.300]   You might have some sort of activity or dinner or something going on next week, but we don't
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.180]   have normal Bible study next week.
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.580]   Just to kind of give you a heads up.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.580]   Okay?
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.780]   Alright, let me pray for us and we'll jump right in.
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:49.940]   Heavenly Father, we pray that the study of Leviticus would open our eyes, Lord God, to
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.020]   all the things that you have implanted even before Christ ever came.
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.620]   That all of these things, Lord, that ultimately to help the Jewish people, Lord, to know who
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.220]   you are and for us to look back, Lord God, and to see your sovereign hands in every little
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.620]   detail, Lord, how you prepared, predestined, elected, and we pray that you give us insight,
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.060]   help us, Lord God, to understand, help us, Lord God, to have a greater grasp of, Lord,
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.500]   the new covenant because of the things that you've done in the old covenant.
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.380]   So we ask, Lord God, you would give us understanding by your spirit.
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.740]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.740]   Amen.
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.380]   Alright, so today's text, you know, we only have about three or four more chapters left
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.560]   in Leviticus, but chapter 24 is at least the three parts that are, it's actually in two
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.500]   main parts, but the three parts, if you wanted to break it down and be technical, the first
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.180]   part is about the lamp and about how keeping that burning, and the second part is about
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.020]   the bread and the 12 cakes that were commanded to make, and then the third part is about
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.200]   the punishment for blaspheming the name of God.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.780]   And all three of it, it conveys or teaches to the nation of Israel the seriousness of
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.240]   the command of holiness.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.860]   And so all of these things are ultimately the same thing that's been taught all throughout
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.180]   the book of Leviticus is to teach that God's holy presence requires that people need to
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.580]   be holy.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.940]   And so that's a running theme in everything that he does, whether it's the sacrifice of
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.820]   animals or sacredness of the priesthood, even the garment that they wear, every part of
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:39.420]   it points to the fact that a holy God cannot simply dwell among sinful people without consequences.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.180]   So today, the first part of it talks about lighting of the lamp.
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.700]   Okay, let me get into this.
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.700]   I'm going to jump through it real quick.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.300]   So this is a really bad picture on the computer.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.380]   Looked pretty good, but okay, so I don't know if you can, you see this light?
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.380]   Okay.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.660]   So here's the obvious lamp stand, and this is the veil of the curtain.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.580]   It's kind of opened up so that you can see what's inside, but obviously normally this
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.740]   whole thing would be covered.
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.860]   And this is the table where the bread is held.
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.280]   So everything that they're talking about is talking about in this room.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.060]   So this is called, what room do you call this?
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.740]   Holy of Holies, and the outer one is just called Holy, right?
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.220]   This is the Holy Chamber, and this is the Holy of Holies.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.380]   So the priests, they can only go as far as this room.
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.340]   This is as close to you are able to get before you get to God.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.140]   Holy of Holies, again, obviously all of this is in some sense symbolic, but only the high
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.540]   priest is able to enter here on the Day of Atonement once a year, and even that, you
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.900]   have to kind of hurry up and do your duty and come out.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:07.020]   So normally, only the priests can enter into this area, and again, on a regular basis,
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.980]   and this is as far as God allowed them to come.
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.380]   And so what is happening today in chapter 24 is about what is supposed to be lit and
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.260]   made into this room, so that every time they've entered into this room, these light and the
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.980]   bread was to symbolize something.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.820]   So the primary thing that these two things, the light and the bread or the cake symbolize
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.820]   was the presence of God.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.980]   So I'm going to jump into that.
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.940]   The lamps were to be kept burning through the night, and again, verses 1 through 4,
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.940]   and the word continually used four times.
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.820]   So if you notice that over and over again, it says continually, repeatedly, day and night,
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.820]   right?
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.540]   It is to be lit morning and night.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.460]   It is to be a perpetual statute throughout the generation.
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.580]   So if you notice, if you study through 24, you'll notice that that language, at least
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.900]   the first part of it, verse 1 through 9, he repeats, do this, repeat it over and over
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.060]   again, continuously, continuously, morning till night.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.580]   It is an everlasting statute.
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.800]   So if you've read it, you probably already picked up on that, that the intent of this
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:25.840]   is to teach the nation of Israel of an ongoing presence of God in the nation of Israel, right?
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.960]   So the light represented the Lord's presence.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.380]   And again, this was, the Lord's presence among the nation of Israel wasn't, he just showed
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.120]   up to perform a miracle and disappeared, or he spoke to them and disappeared, but all
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.960]   of this pointed to the fact that God's presence was with the nation of Israel nonstop, continuously,
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.640]   over and over and over again.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.520]   So every time a priest would enter into the holies, he would be reminded, oh, the Lord
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.520]   is here.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.120]   The Lord is here.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.420]   We see that in the Old Testament, Israel is often portrayed as the light of the world.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.400]   We see that Jesus says that he is the light of the world in John 8, 12.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.360]   Jesus says we are the light of the world in Matthew 5, 14.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.120]   And then we go to the book of Revelation, and it says that the church is the lampstand,
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.440]   Revelations 1, 12, and 20.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.580]   So the light symbolizes God's presence.
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.520]   The people of God, the church, our very selves, and all of it, and ultimately God says that
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.800]   his light that dwells in us was meant to be the light for the world.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.340]   And that's what that light in the holy place was to symbolize, that this light among the
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.360]   nation of Israel was to be continuous and constant, and it was a perpetual statue.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.320]   This was not a statue that God made, and then for a period of time, once it's done, that
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.680]   God withdraws his presence.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.520]   In other words, it was teaching the nation of Israel, as long as the light was lit, God
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.160]   was with them always.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.080]   And this ultimately, obviously, points to what?
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.160]   Who is in us now?
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.360]   Holy Spirit.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.720]   The Holy Spirit is in us, and as a result of the Holy Spirit indwelling in us, we've
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   become the light of the world.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.120]   And when does this stop?
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.800]   When does the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in us stop?
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.480]   Tuesday?
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.480]   Next month?
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.480]   Next year?
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.680]   Eternal, right?
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.040]   That's the difference between the state of Adam and Eve before the fall, and our eternal
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.040]   state.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.480]   People say, "Well, Adam and Eve fell when they were in the Garden of Eden, what's going
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.800]   to prevent us from falling when we are in eternity?"
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.600]   The distinction is, we in eternity, our state will be elevated above Adam and Eve, because
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:04.080]   the Holy Spirit will indwell in us.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.680]   So all of this lighting, this symbolism of continual presence of God, ultimately pointed
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.840]   to the Holy Spirit indwelling in us, and us becoming the light.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.920]   And this is the table, and those are the cakes, and again, this is all educated guess.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.040]   No one knows what that cake looks like.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.440]   We don't know if it was round.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.560]   I don't know if it was round, and even the size of it, no one knows for sure, and I'm
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.640]   going to get to it in a little bit, but they believe that it most likely was stacked up
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.880]   because they couldn't, the reason why they stacked it up is because they didn't think
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.080]   it would fit this way.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.080]   Right?
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:44.520]   They put six, six on each side, so they think most likely it was just stacked up that way.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:51.480]   On here it looks like donuts, but it's an educated guess.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:58.200]   The second part of it, to make the twelve loaves representing the twelve tribes of Israel.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.880]   It was a memorial portion, it says in verse seven, meaning it not only served as a token
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:10.920]   of offering to God, but it was also a request, like a prayer offered to God for his favor.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.240]   And so that was, it was kind of what they call a meal offering, where they bring it
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.960]   to the Lord, and it's something that they ate, but it was also an act of offering to
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.560]   God as a memorial portion.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.000]   That's what a memorial portion usually means.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.280]   It's to be done every Sabbath day as a lasting covenant between the Lord and Israel.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.920]   So every Sabbath, the priest came in, and they presented this, and then afterwards they
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.080]   would eat of it.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.200]   So this was part of their worship.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.880]   They would give this sacrifice, meaning they were to eat it in the holy place.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.280]   In other words, they weren't allowed to pack this up and then put it in a bag and then
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.600]   go outside and eat it.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.440]   It was part of the Sabbath ceremony, that they would come, present it, and they would
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.440]   eat it.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.160]   And then only the priest would eat it in that room.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.960]   It was given to them as a portion, considered to be most holy, so it wasn't meant to be
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.320]   just a regular meal.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.880]   It's like, "Oh, I didn't eat breakfast, so let me go to the holy's and get some cake
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.880]   today."
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.880]   Right?
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.960]   It was meant to be a part of a sacred ritual.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:27.280]   It was called a most holy to the Lord, because it was, one, right in front of the curtain,
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.640]   meaning that symbolically God is there on the other side, and this is as close as they
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.640]   can get.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:42.560]   That's why this event was considered very sacred.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:49.040]   So just to kind of give you an idea, a tenth of an effa is about four quarts, maybe a gallon.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.320]   That's why no one knows how big a cake would be.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.800]   Actually, I did bake a cake a long time ago in high school, but I don't remember how much
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.880]   flour it took.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:06.720]   So those of you guys who bake, how much would, I don't even know what to use, like an effa,
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.160]   or four quarts of flour, four liters of flour?
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.720]   I don't know what the measuring thing is, I don't even know.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.840]   How much, what kind of a cake would come out of that?
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.840]   How big of a cake do you think?
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.840]   Huh?
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.720]   It'd be huge?
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.720]   How huge?
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.720]   Like this table huge?
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   Huh?
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:32.400]   I was trying to read to find out how big this cake would look like, and I think all
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.560]   the commentators are like me.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.800]   I don't think they bake.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   It'd be a pretty big cake?
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.800]   Yes?
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.760]   Give me an idea, like how big is big?
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.760]   Huh?
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:53.760]   Yes, huge, I know what huge means, but what is huge?
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.760]   There's no 11.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:06.760]   Yes, but when you bake that, how big does that come out?
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:14.400]   All right, okay, about this big?
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.960]   This is just for me personally, because I was just curious.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.760]   This isn't going to add to your Bible study at all.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.760]   About this big?
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.760]   About that big?
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.760]   Okay, that's a pretty big cake, right?
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.720]   I mean, it's supposed to feed a lot of people, so I would assume like, you know, there's
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.640]   a lot of it, but that's a big cake.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.000]   This has nothing to do with Bible study.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I was just curious.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.440]   I was trying to find out like how much cake could they make with that.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.240]   So that picture is inaccurate then, right?
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.200]   Anyway, I was just curious.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.880]   The 12 cakes represented 12 tribes, which I already mentioned.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.480]   The table which the cakes were put on was called the table of Shupra, and I apologize,
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:58.280]   I used the word Shupra in your study question, but that word comes from Numbers 4-7 and also
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:04.000]   in Exodus 25-30, and it literally means the bread of presence.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.520]   So again, the light and the bread represented God's blessing and presence upon the nation
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.520]   of Israel.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.560]   So every time the Israelites came into the holy, or the priests came in, it was a reminder
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.160]   to them the Lord is here.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.240]   They couldn't, but they could never get behind the veil, right?
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.240]   And that's why I remember the significance of Jesus dying on the cross was when he was
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   crucified.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.040]   Remember what happens, that the veil is torn.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.760]   But the Israelites would, the priests would constantly come in and they would be reminded
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.800]   the Lord is here, the Lord is here, but not beyond this point, right?
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:47.880]   But Christ's crucifixion opens that door to go into the inner chamber of God, right?
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:54.720]   So this is what this offering represented, reminding them that God was here.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.280]   We are told in the Lord's Prayer to ask for our daily bread.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.080]   Jesus himself calls himself the bread of life.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.800]   Okay, all right.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   So all of that to remind us, again, to point to God's presence in the nation of Israel.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:21.960]   Now we can get into a study of how often the Bible talks about the light and how it points
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:27.200]   to God and how often the Bible talks about the bread and points and fulfilled in Christ
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.400]   and our sustenance and how God takes care of us.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.760]   I mean, again, the whole study on that.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.360]   But again, just for sake of time, it ultimately pointed to the presence of God in the nation
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.360]   of Israel.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.360]   Okay?
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:44.080]   So if you remember, again, I didn't go into the study of the ingredients, but every ingredient
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.600]   that is mentioned there was to be the finest and the purest and the most expensive.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.960]   It was not to be made simply for food.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.000]   It was an offering that was given to God.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.440]   And those offering as a meal offering was made into a cake for the purpose of participating,
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.540]   right?
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.880]   So the only light in the holies would have been those candles.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.000]   So if those candles were not lit, you couldn't see anything.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.780]   And then once you get in, you can see because of the light, which was the presence of God,
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.840]   and then you see the bread, which is God reminding them that God is the one who sustains them,
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.000]   and then you fellowship with God in that room by participating.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.880]   And all of this as an act of offering to God, but never beyond the veil.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.680]   Okay?
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:33.280]   The third part of it reminds the Israelites to take seriously the command given to them
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.480]   by the Lord.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.960]   On the surface, it kind of seems random because they don't seem connected, right?
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.240]   But all of this, ultimately, you have to see it in the bigger picture of God making sure
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.600]   that all the commandments given to them are taken seriously.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.800]   Remember the first part of the chiasm, right?
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.560]   The first part of the chiasm taught holiness where?
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.760]   In the tabernacle and the what?
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.760]   The priesthood.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.640]   Remember that?
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.640]   Right?
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:09.600]   All the way up to chapter 16 and 17, the emphasis was that God is holy, and in order to approach
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.400]   him, there has to be blood sacrifice, and the priest had to be set apart.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.560]   Right?
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.120]   The second part of it, the second part of the chiasm, teaches about the holiness of
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.760]   God in the presence of the nation of Israel.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:27.720]   So all the laws and commands are about the purity of the people themselves.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:34.120]   So if you remember, in chapter 10, once the law is given and the priest comes to sacrifice,
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.200]   what's the first thing that happens?
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.880]   The biggest chapter of 10.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.720]   All the instructions are given, all the instructions about the animals are given, and then all
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.040]   the instructions about the priest and how they ought to approach God, and then the first
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.160]   thing they, first time they practice this, what happens?
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.480]   Nei Devin Nebihu is consumed with the fire, right?
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.040]   For offering up a strange fire.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.320]   So the first thing that happens is to teach them to take God's command seriously.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.400]   Right?
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.320]   So we come to this side of the chiasm, and then now the commandments are given.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.040]   We're not done with the commandments, but the general commandments to the nation of
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.480]   Israel about the purity rights, right?
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:22.000]   And then they go to the community, and then the first thing that we are told that happens
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.120]   in the community is blasphemy.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.640]   And as a result of that, capital punishment happens.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.560]   But the distinction between the capital punishment of the priest and the capital punishment of
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:38.400]   this man is that the capital punishment was carried out by God in the first part of the
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.440]   chiasm, right?
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.440]   And who carries out the capital punishment on this side?
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.880]   The community, right?
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:53.080]   So God purges the tabernacle and the priesthood, and then God calls the people to purge sin
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:59.240]   among its community, okay?
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:05.880]   So again, as I mentioned, as the first two priests in Leviticus chapter 10, and it serves
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:18.840]   as a warning to take the Lord's command seriously.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.040]   So again, it says in verse 12, "They put him in custody so that the command of the Lord
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.040]   might be made clear to them."
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.240]   In case anybody says, "Oh, I didn't know," right?
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.400]   He says, "It wasn't simply to punish.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:35.320]   It was also for the purpose of educating the nation of Israel, what God commanded to make
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.680]   it clear to them, that what God says, He does.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.240]   God says He will save, He will save.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.040]   God says He will punish, He will punish," right?
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:52.800]   So God's faithfulness not only points to His salvation, but it also points to His condemnation.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.320]   The son of Israelite woman was not simply using the Lord's name in vain, but was blaspheming
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.320]   and cursing God.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.960]   It wasn't just, he just kind of blurted out the Lord's name.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:14.640]   The language points to the fact that he was cursing God.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:20.280]   And it's noteworthy that he is mentioned not as a pure Israelite, but his mom was an Israelite,
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.120]   but his father was an Egyptian.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.720]   In Exodus chapter 12, 38, it says that when the Israelites left, there were actually a
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.000]   group of people who were mixed.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.680]   So during the time of captivity, during Egypt, while they were slaves, many of the Jews already
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.280]   compromised or are intermarried with the Egyptians.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:43.000]   So when they were delivered and escaped, there was a lot of Egyptians who came out along
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.680]   with the Israelites.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.960]   And then a lot of the children, just like this man, who had a father who was an Egyptian,
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:54.480]   a mother who was a Jew, was also mixed up in this group.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:01.120]   And within that group, obviously a lot of idols were brought from Egypt through those
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:06.000]   people because they brought their God from their home, because it was a lot of them who
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   were mixed.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.120]   And so this man most likely was one of those people, that he was an Israelite by his mother's
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.320]   side, but an Egyptian by father's side.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.960]   So maybe he didn't have this kind of loyalty to God that the other Israelites did.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.880]   So when he got mad, he got in a fight, he cursed their God.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.720]   Because his God from his father was probably an Egyptian God.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:34.320]   So the son of the Israelites was not considered a native-born Israelite.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.600]   And this is the reason why the Israelites asked the Lord to make things clear in verse
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.020]   12.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:44.240]   So we know what to do with the Israelites because God made it very clear.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.160]   But what do we do with a man who is not an Israelite, who is not completely Israelite?
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.400]   Does the law apply to this man too?
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:59.760]   So the first thing that is taught, that the blasphemer was to be taken outside the camp.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.120]   There are three things that God tells them to do.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:16.040]   One is to take him outside the camp.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:24.280]   The reason why they were commanded to take him outside the camp was because the execution
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.720]   was to be carried out and the dead bodies would ritually be defiling the camp.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.400]   So you couldn't have a dead body in the camp, so in order for him to be executed, he had
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.720]   to be taken outside.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:45.880]   Second thing they were told to do, they were told to lay their hands on his head.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.200]   And it was very specific for those people who heard him.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:57.760]   In verse 14, it says, "And let all who heard him lay their hands on his head."
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.320]   Meaning the people who are offended and people who are affected by this man's sin to lay
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.760]   their hands on him.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.920]   And the laying under the hand signified that all the pollution from what he may have caused
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.380]   will be placed on him.
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.540]   So that kind of reminiscent of Leviticus 16, the day of atonement, right, when the high
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:22.120]   priest would lay his hands upon the goat and it represented the sins of the nation, right,
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.920]   and it would be led and the other one would be slaughtered.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:31.200]   So in the same way, the people who heard him, who was either offended or affected by what
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.440]   he said, his sin, would lay their hands on him and that their sins would also be expelled
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.560]   along with this man.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:44.780]   Third, the blasphemer was to be stoned to death by the entire assembly to teach that
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:53.260]   the sin was being expelled not simply from the person but from the whole community.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.080]   So it wasn't just simply about that person.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:02.460]   So if you, again, because you and I were raised in an individualistic society, right, we have
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:10.180]   to work toward understanding group mentality or community because we naturally think, well,
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.900]   sin is just between me and God, right?
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.500]   And it was clear in the Old Testament that when an individual sinned, not only does it
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.540]   cause sin for him, it caused sin for his family, it caused sin for the community, and ultimately
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.040]   the nation of Israel, right?
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.020]   And that's why when sin came into the camp, they wanted to make sure that that sin was
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.820]   purged from the camp.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:40.660]   Does this apply in the New Testament principle?
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.660]   Very much so.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:51.340]   And there's a lot of confusion in our generation where we think that any dealing with sin,
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.740]   right, any dealing with sin is not of God because God is gracious.
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.460]   God would never do such a thing, right?
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.740]   But principle is clearly taught that God, first and foremost, that his community, he
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.420]   calls us to be holy, right?
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:11.460]   Now we have to be very, very careful how we practice that, but we have to be very, very
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.140]   careful that we do not not practice that.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.580]   Does that make any sense?
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.660]   Yeah.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:23.020]   Because we err on one side where God is okay with any kind of sin because he's gracious
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.500]   and loving God, and as we only say, "Hey, God, forgive me," like everything's okay.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.260]   And then the other end it is where we're examining everybody to make sure that they're doing
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.420]   and saying the right thing or we jump on them and discipline them, right?
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.940]   And that's not the case either.
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.100]   The scripture is full of commandments.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.500]   First Corinthians 3, 16 to 17, "Do you not know that you are a temple of God and the
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.940]   Spirit of God dwells in you?
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.820]   If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.700]   holy and that is what you are."
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.260]   He's talking about people who are being divisive in the church.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.260]   He doesn't bring up the issue, he doesn't mention any particular sin up to this point,
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.100]   other than the fact that the church was divided.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.940]   They were divided because they were saying, "I like Paul, I like Apollos," and so that
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.140]   caused all kinds of chaos in the church.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:12.500]   He says, "If you are the source of division in the church and you are dividing God's holy
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:16.300]   temple," he said, "God will bring judgment upon you."
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.880]   First Corinthians 5, 5, "I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.660]   of his flesh so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.860]   He's talking about a particular sin of a man who was having physical relation, possibly,
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:29.860]   with his mother.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:35.900]   It could be his stepmother, but it doesn't specify, it just says mother.
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.340]   Now are human beings perverted enough where that can possibly happen?
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.620]   Has that ever happened in human history?
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.620]   Absolutely.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.620]   Right?
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:49.540]   I think most people would kind of rather think that maybe it's not the real mother, but the
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.020]   Bible doesn't qualify that.
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:58.340]   He said the sin was hideous enough that even the people outside of the church was not practicing
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.340]   this.
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.780]   And yet, because the church was divided, they weren't doing anything about it.
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.700]   The leadership wasn't strong.
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.300]   And as a result of that, they just kind of let it be, and Paul's rebuking the church
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.060]   for not dealing with this sin.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.900]   And so he says, "When I come, I will deal with it."
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.580]   That's what he's saying here.
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.980]   Matthew 18 is talking about church discipline.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.460]   If your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.980]   If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.220]   But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you so that by the mouth
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.100]   of two or three witnesses, every fact may be confirmed.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.140]   So I'm not going to go through all of it, but basically it's about church discipline.
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.140]   Right?
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:43.620]   Oftentimes you hear people using those passages where two or three are gathered together,
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.060]   they are in their midst.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.260]   You know, like, "Oh, that's great fellowship."
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.980]   You know, "The Holy Spirit is with us."
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.200]   It's in the context of discipline.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:57.020]   When somebody sins and refuses to repent, you've gone and sent other brothers with them
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.620]   and they refuse to listen.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.380]   And then to take it to the church basically means to elevate it to the leadership.
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:06.220]   So the whole church knows, the whole community knows, and they still refuse to repent, and
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.580]   then he says, "Then you carry out discipline."
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.580]   Right?
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:16.100]   It is dangerous not to practice church discipline.
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.060]   And it doesn't make you a gracious and loving person.
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.260]   Right?
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:28.500]   Because if your son is headed down a path that is harmful to him, being gracious is
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.500]   not gracious.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.500]   That's indifference.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.500]   That's a bad father.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.860]   That's a bad mother.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:40.460]   We confuse in our churches that being gracious and kind means that you just sweep sins underneath
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.460]   the rug.
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.300]   You would never do that to somebody that you really love.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.500]   You would never do that to somebody you really love.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.140]   You would never ignore that.
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.140]   Right?
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:58.860]   Because again, the confusion is we've talked about grace to the point where God's holiness,
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.700]   it's just kind of something that happened in the Old Testament, but it doesn't exist
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.700]   today.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:07.100]   God is the same God that gave the commandments at the tabernacle is the same God today.
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.580]   The only reason why we are not consumed is because the blood of Christ covers us.
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:17.140]   But it's the same God that demands and desires holiness in the church.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.500]   Right?
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.700]   We have to be careful how we practice that.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.700]   Right?
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.540]   Because we have a tendency to err on one or the other.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.300]   And I'll talk about that a little bit at the end.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.620]   But again, over and over again, the scripture talks about discipline.
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.060]   Again, this is not just a couple of verses.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.820]   Oh, you're taking it out of context.
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.780]   It's all throughout scripture.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.140]   It's all in the Old Testament.
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:45.180]   It's scattered all throughout the New Testament to keep the community of God's people holy.
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.700]   Right?
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.420]   This is why a seeker-friendly church is unbiblical.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.420]   Right?
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.860]   Yeah, I said it.
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:55.860]   Right?
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:01.340]   I'm sorry if you're offended by that, but it is unbiblical because the church is a gathering
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.520]   of God's people.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.500]   So can non-Christians come to church?
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.100]   Of course they can.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.100]   Right?
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:12.180]   But the church is not a gathering of non-Christians.
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:17.780]   So for the church to organize for the purpose of non-Christians feeling comfortable in the
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:18.780]   church is unbiblical.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.820]   That's not a church.
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.020]   You can call that an outreach.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.320]   You can call that an event.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.220]   You can call that whatever you want, but that's not the church.
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:31.360]   The biblical understanding of the church is people who have been called out for the purpose
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.900]   of God's worship.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.220]   Right?
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.740]   So I'm not saying that we should ignore the non-Christians, that we shouldn't love the
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:45.540]   non-Christians, reach out to the non-Christians, but the church is a gathering of Christians.
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.620]   And that's why the Bible talks about keeping the church holy.
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:55.380]   In fact, the early church took that so seriously, they wouldn't allow anyone who was not baptized
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.100]   into their church to worship.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:02.820]   So they would have communion, and so the people on the outside thought that they were cannibals
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.460]   because they were talking about eating the flesh of Christ and drinking his blood.
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:11.460]   And because it was such a mystery, the Christian worship, so people on the outside were saying,
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.420]   "These guys are cannibals."
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:20.500]   That's how exclusive the church was because they had to be baptized in order for them
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.500]   to participate.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:27.500]   So we went from that to changing everything in the church so that the non-Christian would
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.180]   be comfortable at church.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:34.460]   I can go off on that, and you've heard me go off, and I'm not going to go off on it
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:39.300]   because you already know what I think about that, but I want you to see biblically why
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:43.700]   our church ministry philosophy is the way it is because it's not because we don't love
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.740]   the non-Christians.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:52.740]   In order for us to be a light, the light cannot be mixed with the darkness in the church because
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.940]   the church is called to be a light, so the church has to be wholly set apart.
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:01.380]   So there's a reason why God tells the nation of Israel to purge this sin, because God's
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:08.380]   trying to keep the nation of Israel holy.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.740]   This section teaches three principles about justice.
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.380]   This is where you get the eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.860]   In carrying out this justice, there's three things.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:21.140]   First, they underscore the high value of human life.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.340]   I think in our circles, that's pretty given.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:29.300]   If you're a Christian, I don't think there's as much of a debate, and it's not even just
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.300]   a Christian debate.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:35.500]   I think if you're a theist, I think we're all in agreement, no matter what religion
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:40.380]   you are, there's a higher value to humans.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:47.380]   But sad to say, we do live in a culture where we have Pita who are saying, "Well, we can't
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:53.540]   eat animals because they have equal value as human beings," absolute ridiculousness.
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:58.260]   So the first thing it teaches is that there is a different value to human beings and to
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.260]   animals.
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.780]   He says, "If a man kills a," and he repeats this twice, "If a man kills another man, his
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.580]   penalty is capital punishment."
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:12.220]   Again, I'm not going to get, like if people say, "Is capital punishment Christian?"
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:20.540]   I'm not going to say it's Christian, but it's biblical, which means it's Christian.
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:25.980]   Capital punishment, again, and the argument against that, argument against it is, "Oh,
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.180]   we value human life."
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:34.620]   In fact, the reason why God commanded capital punishment is because he valued human life,
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:39.540]   because it was a serious crime, to deter murder.
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:44.060]   So it wasn't, you know, the argument is, "Oh, human life is so important," as well, you
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:49.180]   know, and that's the very reason why he commanded capital punishment.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:56.340]   Second, they point to the importance of punishment fitting the crime.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.720]   This is where we get the eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, right?
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.920]   This is not the only place.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:06.740]   We find it in Exodus 21, Deuteronomy chapter 19.
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.940]   But it was to say that the punishment must fit the crime.
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:14.940]   So in other words, a man, he commits murder, capital punishment is carried out.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:20.660]   But if he kills an animal, you compensate with another animal, right?
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.820]   You don't say, "Hey, you killed my animal, I'm going to kill you," right?
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:30.860]   It's to restrain, because our natural tendency is to give out more.
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:35.980]   Okay, some of you guys may think, "Oh, that's not me."
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.740]   It's like, maybe you think that's not you, right?
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:45.020]   But our natural tendency is to, if somebody wrongs me, I want to make sure that they are
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.940]   taught a lesson, right?
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:52.740]   I remember when I was young, when I would get into a fight with one of my brothers,
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.860]   my dad would always, he would never lose his temper, he would always be controlled.
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:00.440]   And the way he would punish us, he would have us sit across each other.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.660]   This is if we were fighting against each other, right?
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.020]   And it was usually between me and my younger brother, Philip.
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.140]   My older brother was too big, he would kill us, right?
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:15.380]   So he would have us stand, and he would have us slap each other, right?
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.780]   Because he said, "Well, you guys are fighting, so I want you guys to do it controlled."
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:24.120]   So it would usually start with a tap, and then I would tap back.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.980]   Then I would think, "Wow, that tap was a little bit harder than what I gave," and then I would
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.540]   tap back.
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:33.340]   And then now he's hurt, so he would tap back, and then it would usually escalate, right?
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.100]   He would escalate to the point where we're trying to literally hurt each other, and then
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.220]   that's when my dad would kind of step in, right?
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:44.940]   He would step in and say, "Okay, that's enough, and you guys, if you fight, that's the way
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:45.940]   you're going to fight."
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:51.100]   The reason why I tell that story is, every time my dad did that, it always ended with
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.980]   an escalation, 100% of the time.
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.940]   It would never end with a tap, tap, tap, tap.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.700]   It was never equal.
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:05.340]   At some point, I would think, or he would think I hit harder than he did, the previous
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:10.740]   one, and then as a result of that, he'd need to pay me back, and then he would pay me back,
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:15.020]   and then say, "Wow, I can't believe you did that," and I would pay him back, and that's
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:19.740]   how society gets ruined, right?
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:25.100]   You have a bunch of people who are offended, trying to pay back what they did, and then
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.140]   it escalates, and the next thing you know, you have a war, right?
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:33.580]   So the commandment, the second principle is make sure that the punishment fits the crime,
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:34.620]   right?
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:39.100]   And again, if you've ever sat through marriage counseling with me, you know one of the principles
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:45.500]   of biblical communication is to never fight when you're angry, even though that's usually
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.560]   when we fight, right?
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:52.060]   Because everything coming out of your mouth is going to be escalated when you're angry,
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.060]   right?
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.980]   When you're upset about something, say, "You never do this.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.340]   You always do this.
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.900]   I wish I never," and then you say these escalated things, and then when you're not angry, say,
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.500]   "Oh, man, I shouldn't have said that," but you said it already, right?
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:11.700]   So this is to kind of make sure that whatever the sin was, whatever the punishment was required,
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:18.100]   that it's carried out in justice, not retribution, right?
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:25.660]   Third, it teaches that there is no exception to this.
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:29.660]   So the second principle was, and which was the original question, this guy was not a
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.860]   complete Jew, so what do we do with him?
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:35.660]   So the one part of it was to punish him, but the second part was to keep the community
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.660]   pure.
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.740]   So for that reason, God said, "There is no exception."
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:46.300]   Whether you're a foreigner or whether you are a native, that if he defiles the community,
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:50.620]   it must be carried out, okay?
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:55.340]   All of this pointing to what God desired of his community.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.740]   This is how God was going to carry it out.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.020]   So this is not about retribution.
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:03.940]   This is not God saying that if they hurt you, I'm going to completely destroy them, right?
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.940]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.460]   He's saying, like, if you want to practice righteousness, this is what righteousness
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.780]   looks like, right?
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.820]   If you want to practice righteousness.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:15.100]   So in every government, they practice righteousness.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:22.380]   And he said that's why God establishes authority, because they carry out justice for those who
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:26.780]   deserve it in order to restrain sin, restrain chaos.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.660]   But when we get to the New Testament, the distinction between the Old and the New Covenant
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:34.940]   is the Old Covenant was based upon righteousness or based upon the law.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:38.540]   The New Covenant is based upon his grace.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.860]   And Jesus actually mentions that in Matthew 12.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:46.740]   No, this is not the passage.
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:51.100]   In Matthew 5, he said, "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.100]   a tooth.'
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.820]   But I say to you, do not resist an evil person, but whoever slaps you on your right cheek,
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.820]   turn the other to him also.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:02.900]   If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat also.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.620]   Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him too."
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:11.540]   So the whole point of this is he's not saying that the eye for an eye, tooth for tooth wasn't
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.540]   right.
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.540]   He's not saying, you know what, I changed my mind.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.980]   I'm going to do something different, right?
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:19.100]   He's basically saying the Old Covenant, this was the practice of righteousness, but the
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:25.060]   New Covenant, because of the blood of Christ, he's commanding us to do even more than that,
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.060]   right?
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:31.820]   And I remember a very good description of righteousness, no, justice, mercy, and grace,
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:32.820]   right?
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.940]   And it may not be the technical term, but I thought this was a great way to explain
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.940]   this.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.380]   You know, justice is getting what you deserve.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.900]   Mercy is not getting what you deserve.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.660]   And grace is getting what you didn't deserve.
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:49.660]   Does that make sense?
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.100]   So that's the distinction between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.380]   The Old Covenant was justice, right?
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.380]   Blessings and curses.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.460]   If you obey, you will be blessed.
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.620]   If you disobey, you'll be cursed.
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.820]   So this is God's teaching what justice looks like, right?
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.460]   And that's righteousness.
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:11.140]   And God will be perfectly just to wipe out mankind, because all have sinned and fall
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.740]   short of the glory of God.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:17.540]   We come to the New Covenant, he practices not only mercy, he goes a step further than
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.060]   that and gives us grace.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:24.340]   The fact that he didn't wipe out the nation of Israel, the fact that he didn't come and
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:29.260]   flood the nations over and over again, would have still been mercy.
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:36.700]   He would have still been merciful if Israelites lived as slaves to the Assyrians and the Babylonians
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:40.460]   because they committed sin and God didn't crush them.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:45.100]   But he went beyond that in the New Testament, where he came and he gave his only begotten
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:51.700]   son and he made us adopted children into his kingdom.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:56.340]   And so again, that's what Jesus is not saying the Old Testament law is nullified, he's saying
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:01.060]   those things were given, but now I call you to do even further.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:05.100]   Not to simply practice justice, but to practice mercy.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:10.300]   Now think about that in our community, as Christians.
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:18.460]   When we are wronged, we feel justified to retaliate, whether through words or through
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.460]   actions.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.340]   "Well, they did this, so they deserve this."
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:29.780]   And you are right, that may be the just thing to do, that may be the fair thing to do, but
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:33.540]   the New Covenant calls us to go beyond that.
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:38.060]   That's why Jesus says, "If you love as I have loved you, then the world will know you are
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:43.260]   my disciples, and the love that he practiced was not justice, was not simply mercy, but
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.500]   grace."
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:50.060]   And so that's what ultimately points to all of these things God placed in the nation of
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:55.860]   Israel, but ultimately when Christ fulfills it, he doesn't just fulfill it, he fulfills
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:59.260]   it and takes it to the next level.
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:02.180]   That's what all of this points to.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:06.460]   So the discussion questions for today, the three of them, what is an everlasting ordinance
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:12.020]   that we've been given in the New Covenant to remind us of God's presence in our lives?
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.180]   And there's more than one.
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:17.580]   You can probably think of many, but what is commanded?
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:24.220]   Again, I hear a lot of cliches saying, "We're not about religion, we're about relationship."
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.500]   It sounds great, but Christianity is a religion.
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:33.360]   There's a set of doctrines and rules that God has given us for us to follow.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:38.020]   So it's not like, "Well, as long as I feel this connection with God, all this other coming
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:42.020]   to church and communion, all this stuff is not necessary because that's religion."
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.380]   Absolutely false, right?
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:49.560]   Because Christianity also has boundaries and rules and regulations and commandments that
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.180]   God desires us to follow.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:57.740]   What are some things that are given to us in the New Covenant to remind us as an everlasting
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:01.020]   covenant?
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:04.420]   Number two, do you think you live with the awareness of God's presence in your daily
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:05.420]   life?
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.020]   How does a real awareness of God's presence affect the way you live?
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.140]   Think about that.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:17.100]   If you struggle with pornography, if you knew that Christ was sitting right there, how would
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.220]   that affect your life?
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.580]   I bet it would affect it tremendously.
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.540]   It would affect our speech.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.380]   It would affect the way what we watch.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.660]   If you're a parent, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:34.540]   There are certain things that you may have watched very loosely until you had a kid and
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.580]   you have a three or four year old sitting next to you watching the same thing and you're
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:41.740]   very aware that this is inappropriate.
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:46.140]   As a result of that, you say, "Oh, I can't watch this because of my kids, because it's
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.820]   inappropriate for him."
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:53.780]   I know because I'm a pastor, there are certain things that you will not do in front of me,
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:59.020]   not because I'm more holier than you are, but because I represent holiness, because
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.980]   I represent God.
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.500]   There are certain things you won't say or do, even though you're very free with your
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.660]   friends and I know what they are.
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:15.580]   I'm just saying, my point is, if you are aware of the presence of God in your life, the Holy
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:23.940]   Spirit that dwells in us 24/7 as an everlasting covenant, morning to evening, all the time,
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:32.460]   as God did with the bread or the cake and with the lamb, how would that affect our daily
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:33.460]   lives?
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:38.820]   That's my question, is how often are you aware of the presence of God, not just at the church,
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:42.460]   but with you at home, when you sleep, when you're in front of your computer?
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.980]   The Holy Spirit is right there with you.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:53.660]   He's there not just to watch us, but as an encouragement, to guide us and lead us, to
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:59.220]   intercede on our behalf, to grow on our behalf, but the Holy Spirit is with us and in us 24/7.
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:05.180]   Number three, how do you establish community that practices grace without creating a community
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:08.380]   that doesn't take holiness seriously?
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:12.140]   Because our tendency is to err on both sides.
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:17.420]   And I'll bet you even in this room, you have some people who are gracious to the point
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:23.820]   where people can literally do anything in front of you and you say nothing.
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:28.420]   And that is also disobedience.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:33.740]   If you have somebody who is living in sin, who is walking in sin, and you're so gracious
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:35.940]   that you say nothing, you're not being gracious.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:39.620]   In fact, you're very selfish, because you're not thinking about that person.
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:43.580]   You're only thinking about what that person might say of you.
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.660]   And that's the reason why you stay quiet.
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:49.380]   So we have a tendency to err on that side.
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:56.060]   The other side is where you become the detective in everybody's life, and you have to weed
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.620]   out all the yeast in other people's lives.
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.540]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:08.260]   Every sin, every thought, every behavior needs to be called out.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.220]   And then you have that other, and no one wants to be around you.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.220]   Because who wants that?
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:17.620]   But how do we practice this?
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:22.300]   And I'm just going to let you guys take some time to discuss it, but I remember a guy came
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:26.860]   to me years and years ago, and he said, "Does your church practice church discipline?"
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:30.060]   And I said, "Yeah, when it's necessary, we practice church discipline.
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:34.580]   We just don't do it like every members' meeting, we have three people, we need to discipline.
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:35.580]   That doesn't happen."
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:37.780]   And then he's like, "Oh, good, good.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:41.540]   I'm glad you practice church discipline, because I think the greatest problem in our church
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:46.060]   today is that the churches refuse to practice church discipline."
[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:50.620]   And I know what he meant by that, but I remember having that conversation with him, and I don't
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:51.620]   agree with you.
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:53.460]   I don't think that's the biggest problem.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:57.860]   I think the biggest problem is that we don't love each other enough.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:04.680]   We don't love each other enough where we look at discipline as a punishment, instead of
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.380]   shepherding and caring.
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:13.500]   And the reason why we just kind of let sin be swept under the rug is because we don't
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:17.300]   care enough to do anything about it.
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:22.900]   If we loved each other the way that Christ calls us to love one another, we would take
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:27.780]   sin more seriously, not only in our lives, but in other people's lives.
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:35.240]   So when you deal with sin in the context of practicing love, it's much easier to balance
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.640]   than if you're trying to practice one or the other.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.480]   Do I love them or do I stone them?
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:47.160]   And if that's a two-option in your head, then it's going to be very difficult to balance.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:52.920]   So I think the ultimate balance is, do I really care and love that person enough to be involved
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.040]   even when they're erring?
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.200]   So I want you guys to take some time in your group to discuss these questions.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:06.600]   So let me pray for us and then I'll have you guys get into your groups.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:11.440]   Heavenly Father, I ask for wisdom in your Holy Spirit to lead and guide the discussions.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:16.600]   And I pray that you would help us to be transparent, help us, Lord God, in our weakness, to be
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:23.960]   open, help us to care enough about each other's lives, that whether we need encouragement,
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:28.560]   we need grace and understanding, or we need accountability, help us to do it in a way
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.120]   that reflects you.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:35.640]   We are unable, Father God, to know how to balance all of these things.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:43.160]   But as we look at the perfect sacrifice of Christ where holiness was not forfeited because
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:48.600]   of His grace and love, it was demonstrated in perfect union.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:54.400]   Help us, Lord God, to be a reflection of Christ's righteousness and His mercy and grace.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.400]   So we pray that you would guide and lead us in our discussion.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.400]   In Jesus' name we pray.
