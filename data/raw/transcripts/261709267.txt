[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   All right, let's go right into this.
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.220]   So if you could bow your heads with me in prayer, we'll start the seminar.
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.980]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for this morning and thank you God that there are many who
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.920]   are here to ask this very weighty question, what is genuine conversion?
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:34.800]   And so would you teach us, as lengthy and as quantifiable this material is, oh Father,
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.880]   instruct our hearts to not just test our own salvation, but also to think about how we
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.040]   can better understand our interactions with the lost.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.200]   So God, thank you for this morning.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.760]   Would you give me clarity and would you keep us awake and alert because we know God that
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.720]   the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.240]   So would you train the workers this morning?
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.080]   Okay, so we're going to be talking about what genuine conversion is today.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.600]   And rather than talk about conversion, I'm going to most likely be using the word salvation
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.240]   throughout the length of this seminar.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.800]   And like I was praying, one of the big things is I want our college ministry and our church
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.120]   to become very aware of our surroundings and spiritual state.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.600]   So you know how like when you're living your life, you kind of break up your day into things
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.560]   you're doing, you're in class now or you're at home now or you're at church now and all
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.000]   these kinds of things.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.120]   But I do want us to be very sensitive to the fact that there are people existing in those
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.760]   spheres.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.560]   So when we look at it in categories, in terms of our own lives, we kind of become very self-centered
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.440]   and thinking like this is what I'm doing.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.240]   And so people become a program or an agenda.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.020]   But rather than that, I hope that our eyes are open to see people where they are.
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.400]   And everyone that you see, yes, people outside, but even here in this room, you are destined
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.320]   for one of two places, heaven or hell.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.200]   And that's it.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.840]   And that should put an eternal burden on your soul because we're dealing with eternal beings.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.360]   And so that's why we're covering this.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.040]   That's why this was maybe one of the harder studies I've had to do because you know, I
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.040]   was like, "Oh, a seminar.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.040]   I've done seminars before."
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.080]   And then as I was going into it, I was like, "Oh, this is kind of a big topic."
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.520]   So I don't...man, this was really tough for me.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.280]   So I stayed up pretty late last night doing this.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.960]   And so if some things come out a little bit incoherent, please use the question and answer
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.560]   time at the end.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.760]   Steven has put up on the Facebook page, like a Google form kind of thing.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.920]   So you can send your questions that way.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.900]   And then at the very end, after I give you guys a little bit of a break, we'll be going
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.040]   straight into the Q&As.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.080]   So I am going to be trying to run as fast as I can here.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.880]   But at any point, if you have a question that you feel like, "Oh, this would be better addressed
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.360]   like right now," please raise your hand and just ask it.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360]   Okay?
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.520]   So just do this and you can ask the question right away too.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.040]   And I don't mind stopping the teaching for that.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.320]   Okay.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.600]   So the schedule is going to be, we're going to be going through the teaching.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.400]   And then afterwards, we're going to be doing a Q&A.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.200]   And then at the very end, if you have further questions, we're going to have the staff kind
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.640]   of sitting around up front while people are going out and hanging out or going upstairs
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.460]   to get ready to eat and things like that.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.000]   If you have more questions about your own faith or even about like, you know, I have
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.080]   this roommate, I have this friend who's not a believer, and how can I track through this
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.040]   with them?
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.760]   And so the staff is going to be here to kind of help you out with that.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   Okay?
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.960]   So more than anything, please use this morning to gauge where you personally stand.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.000]   So let's get right there into the introduction.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.840]   The question is, how does a person know that he is really saved?
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.160]   Matthew 7, verse 21 through 23.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:31.760]   You don't have to turn there because I'm going to try to have this.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.200]   Okay.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.160]   Did I do that or did you do that?
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.160]   You did it.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.160]   Okay.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160]   All right.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.360]   Matthew 7, verse 21 says here, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.360]   kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.120]   On that day, many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and cast
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.800]   out demons in your name and do many mighty works in your name?'
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.200]   And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.560]   Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.280]   Now this is probably, you've read it before and seen it to be one of the scariest passages
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.080]   in scripture.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.400]   It's terrifying because there's a sense of these people who are proclaiming believers
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.800]   of some sort.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   And they do lots of things that a believer would do.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.680]   And yet they get to the gate, they get to the judgment seat, and they say, "Hey, it's
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.680]   me.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.320]   Let me in."
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.760]   And then Jesus says, "I never knew you."
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.360]   And it's scary because this isn't a hypothetical.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.440]   This is not something that we're reading like, "Oh, this is a scriptural metaphor."
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.600]   This is something that will happen and has already happened.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.400]   The people maybe even we have known in our lives.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.960]   This is maybe the track some of us in this room might be on right now.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.500]   And that's why it's so scary.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:16.520]   That address up here when it says, this guy who gets up there and says, "Lord, Lord."
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.640]   If you ask that question, why is he saying it twice?
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:25.880]   Because that's a form of intimacy and relationship in the Hebrew culture.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.880]   So...
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.880]   Oh, man.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.880]   Why is this not working?
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.680]   What does this thing do?
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.680]   Did you do that, sir?
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.680]   Or did I...
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.680]   You did that, Thijs?
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.680]   Okay, thank you, Thijs.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.680]   All right.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.680]   You might just have to do it the whole time.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.680]   All right.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.640]   So when the personal form of address is repeated, it suggests an intimate personal relationship
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.760]   to the person being spoken to.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:02.040]   So that's there on your worksheet.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.280]   In Genesis chapter 22, verse 11 through 12, you don't have to write these down.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:12.400]   Genesis 46 to Exodus 3, 4, 1 Samuel 3, 10, Luke 10, 41, Luke 22, 31, Acts 9, 4, Matthew
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.400]   27, 46.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.920]   Every time in a Hebrew sense when the name is repeated.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:22.680]   For example, when God calls out to Samuel, if you know that Bible story, what does he
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.680]   say?
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.960]   He says, "Samuel, Samuel, come."
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.480]   It's a sense of intimacy and relationship.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.600]   And so in Matthew 7, 21 through 23, when these people are coming to God and saying, "Lord,
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.360]   Lord," it's saying that they assume they had an intimate relationship with Christ.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.160]   And then Christ, with those heartbreaking words says, "We didn't.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.160]   You fooled yourself.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.960]   You were deceived into thinking that."
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.920]   I brought this up at the retreat, but since the PowerPoint didn't go up, Demas in Colossians
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:03.880]   chapter 4, verse 14, and Philemon 23 through 24, says, "Luke, the beloved physician, greets
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.560]   you, as does Demas."
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:12.120]   Meaning, for the Apostle Paul, Luke and Demas were very intimate, close friends and workers
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.680]   of the gospel together.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.520]   In Philemon 23 to 24, it passed for another great hero of the faith, "My fellow prisoner
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.960]   in Christ, Jesus sends greetings to you, and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke,
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.960]   my fellow workers."
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.680]   Demas was part of the inner circle of Paul.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.240]   They worked together.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.640]   And then again, another heartbreaking passage in 2 Timothy 4, 10.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.800]   If you don't know, 2 Timothy is the last letter before Paul's death.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.600]   At the end of his life, this guy has run with him, has walked with him, has cried with him,
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.720]   has done gospel work with him.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.120]   They've done many things together.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.720]   They've seen the fruit of the harvest reaped together.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:57.920]   And he says, "Come to me quickly," because you can read the tear-stained words of Paul
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.320]   as he's writing this.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.880]   He says, "Come to me quickly, I need you, for Demas, in love with this present world,
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.280]   has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica."
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:18.400]   Even a guy named Demas, a guy like Demas, who was so close to God and who did so much
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.480]   God work, ended up forsaking Christ.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.160]   There's none of us in this room that's kind of above this.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.800]   We really have to think through this together.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.240]   We don't have to turn very much further than a passage like John 13, verse 21 to 26, to
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:42.160]   see how someone so close to Christ can be so far than a guy like Judas.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.560]   In John 13, he washes Judas' feet.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.880]   It's a very intimate act, and even Judas.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.680]   So question for you before we begin, as we're still in the introduction here, if you were
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.160]   to die tonight, where would you be?
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.160]   Where would you go?
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.760]   Heaven or hell?
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.000]   This is not a question to end all questions because of this.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.320]   There are a lot of people who will say, "I'm going to heaven," and they believe it with
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.120]   all their hearts.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.600]   But the secondary question you need to ask them is, "Why do you believe that?
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.800]   Why do you think you're going to heaven?
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.960]   Why do you think you're going to be rescued from hell?"
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:29.840]   If God asks you, "Hey, so yeah, you're here, and you're saying you deserve to be here,
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.560]   but why should I let you in?
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.760]   What would you say in a scenario like that?"
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.880]   So let's go into our first Roman numeral point here.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.600]   What is not salvation?
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.600]   What is not salvation?
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.040]   Now we're going to run through these quickly, these five points.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:53.840]   First, salvation is not saving from your circumstances or trials.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.160]   It's not saving from your circumstances or trials.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.600]   It might be tempting in a lot of your testimonies, if you've ever written out your testimony,
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.720]   to say, "This is what God saved me from.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.320]   I was in the pit of despair.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.080]   I was in darkness."
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.360]   A lot of times it's because you guys break up with someone, and you're crying into your
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.840]   pillow every single night.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.200]   You're like, "Oh, Jesus saved me."
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.800]   That is not what salvation is all about.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.360]   Although he can use those circumstances to bring you to himself, he is not here to save
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.720]   us from our circumstances and our trials.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.480]   Secondly, he's not here to save us from depression.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:44.640]   Thirdly, he's not simply here to save us and to hand us a get-out-of-hell-free card.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.840]   It's not just hell insurance, the salvation.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:57.120]   Fourthly, he doesn't do it just to save us to a better life.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.800]   That's the health and wealth gospel.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.800]   People like Joel Osteen.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:07.440]   Obviously, you've got to be really careful on the pulpit of who you out, but Joel Osteen
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.080]   is an obvious guy that has led a charge.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.320]   This health and wealth gospel of thinking that Christ saves you, and so now you can
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.300]   live in all the prosperity that this world can offer you.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.840]   That is not why he saved you.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:30.120]   Fifthly, all of these might happen as byproducts of salvation, but they are not the point.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:37.040]   All of these things can happen and will happen, but they are not the point of salvation.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.040]   Roman numeral two.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.120]   As you guys can tell, this is kind of a longer worksheet than you're used to, so we've
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.480]   got to move quick.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.400]   What is salvation?
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:50.140]   Simply put, it's to place your faith in the message of the gospel.
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.820]   That is not only salvation, but how you apprehend salvation.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.860]   That's how you take salvation and make it your own.
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.720]   You place your faith in the message of the gospel.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.940]   Then you have to know what the gospel is, so let's run through the gospel.
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.580]   Four points of the gospel.
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.480]   First, God.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.180]   Everything begins with God.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.900]   He is the standard.
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:21.100]   He is holy.
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.940]   Creation begins with God.
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.260]   Salvation begins with God.
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.540]   The beginning of your life begins with God.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.540]   Everything that you're doing in your life is about God.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.160]   Everything that you see is there to glorify God.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.680]   Everything is God.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.860]   He is the standard, and he is a holy God.
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:52.980]   In Isaiah 6, verse 3, Psalm 96, verse 9, you see some things here.
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:57.900]   Isaiah 6, verse 3, "On one call to another and said," remember this is the seraphim,
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.540]   "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.340]   The whole earth is full of his glory."
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:09.700]   He is holy, and it says that the whole earth is full of his glory, meaning everything is
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.300]   meant for his glory.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.300]   Thank you so much.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:18.140]   All right, and then Psalm 96, verse 9, "Worship the Lord and the splendor of holiness.
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.060]   Tremble before him all the earth."
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.340]   This is an understanding of a high view of God.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:28.020]   God is not here to just become an accessory to our lives.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.060]   Everything is about God.
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.060]   God is the standard.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:35.700]   He is the meaning and reason and the sustaining work behind everything that we see.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:41.780]   And so in 1 Peter 1, verse 15, it says, "But as he who called you is holy, then you also
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.540]   be holy in all your conducts, since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'"
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.540]   Do you see that?
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.380]   He is the standard.
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.540]   Sometimes we want to become holy just because we feel like it makes us feel better or makes
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:58.740]   us feel like we're growing as a Christian, or it makes us feel like we can serve better
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.980]   or that we can evangelize better or things like that.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.500]   Those are all man-centered reasons of holiness.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.420]   And we know that the standard of why we want to be holy is because God is holy.
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.220]   He is the only standard.
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:17.020]   And so God and sin cannot coexist.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:25.900]   You know, we get into the gates of heaven and he asks us, "Why should I let you in?"
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.860]   You can't say, "Well, I've lived a pretty good life."
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.580]   You can't say, "I was better than my roommate."
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.820]   You can't say, "I was better than that criminal."
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:45.580]   God sets the standard and his very holy and perfect character is the thing that will become
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:50.660]   the rubric as to how we can enter into the kingdom of heaven.
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:57.620]   Sin and God cannot coexist, and by that, sinners and God cannot coexist.
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.460]   Sometimes we say things like God hates the sin, loves the sinner.
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.940]   True and false.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:13.580]   True, because yes, he loves people, but he cannot love sinners in their sin.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:19.100]   He will love us to save us and to redeem us, but there will be a day where sinners will
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:26.860]   have to face the wrath of God and they will be devoid of God's love for them.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.820]   There is no arguing, understanding that God is the standard behind everything.
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.740]   There is no arguing.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:40.700]   This question that society comes up with and as humanity we bring up, we say, "If God is
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.940]   so good, how could there be suffering?
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.380]   If God is so good, how could there be hell?"
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:52.260]   If we understand this point, we see that if God is so good and he is so holy like this,
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260]   how can any of us be existing right now?
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:01.060]   The simple, enormous truth that God is holy and nothing impure can reside in his presence.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.140]   Nothing.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.220]   And that brings us to the second part of the gospel, which is humans.
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.060]   Whoa, that is tiny.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.060]   Good luck.
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.060]   Humans.
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:15.140]   Humans are sinful.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.820]   Humans not only do sinful things, but are sinners to the core from birth.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:25.740]   Humans exist in total depravity, meaning that there is nothing that we can do in our sin
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.220]   to rescue ourselves.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.740]   There is nothing good in ourselves to even choose God.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.740]   Have you thought about that?
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.540]   We are not going to be talking about Calvinism versus Arminianism or anything like that today,
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:39.580]   but have you ever thought about the Arminian point of view that says that I can choose
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.580]   God?
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.300]   What is it inside of a person that says that that person would be able to choose God, whereas
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.260]   that person will not be able to choose God?
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.220]   You're saying that there is something inside of that person that is good to be able to
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:58.900]   choose, and that is not the case.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:59.900]   Humans are sinful.
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.240]   We're saturated in it.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.860]   It's not only that we do sinful things, but that we're sinners to the core.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.820]   Romans 3 9-12 says, "There is none righteous, not even one."
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.100]   There is no one who understands, none who seeks after God.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.940]   No one wants him.
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:21.740]   Who wants a God over our lives when we desire that position ourselves?
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.900]   And Romans 3 23, hopefully you've all memorized this one, "For all have sinned and fall short
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.140]   of his glory."
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.500]   Right after that is a great gospel message and have been justified, but let's stick with
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.740]   the falling short of his glory part here.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.120]   We fall short of God's glory.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:45.900]   We fall short in giving him his due.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:55.980]   In Hebrews 2 2, we begin to see as sinners before a holy God that judgment is coming
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.540]   to us.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.380]   Judgment is coming.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:08.900]   In Hebrews 2 2 it says, "For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable and
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:16.020]   every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution."
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.020]   That should like make you tremble.
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:27.700]   Every transgression, bar none, ever committed by every heart, by ever in existence of humanity,
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.380]   every transgression or disobedience receives a just retribution.
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.900]   It doesn't matter if you're Adolf Hitler.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.740]   It doesn't matter if it's your mom.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.220]   Everyone, all of us.
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.860]   Hebrews 10 30, "For we know him who said, 'Vengeance is mine.
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.100]   I will repay.'"
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:47.060]   And again, the Lord will judge his people.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.740]   This is the state of humanity.
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:53.860]   If God is holy, then we are sinful.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.900]   And then we're in trouble.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:02.100]   Jesus preached more about hell than heaven.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.980]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.420]   Jesus preached more about hell than heaven.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:15.940]   Now we are not fire and brimstone like the sons of thunder like James and John saying,
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.580]   "Bring down your fire upon this world, God."
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.700]   We're not going to do things like that.
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.300]   We're not going to go out and picket with like you're going to hell signs.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.340]   And yet it's telling if Jesus preached more about hell than heaven.
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.300]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.660]   What do you preach about more?
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.580]   What do you think about more?
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:40.860]   Just by sheer amount of quantity of Bible text that is reserved for talking about hell
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:52.180]   rather than heaven, how are we skewed in our thinking?
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:57.660]   And so it's clear to us and to every person in mankind, if you have not placed your faith
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:06.020]   in Christ, you are going to hell.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.700]   And I tried to make it as blunt as possible there.
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:13.940]   If you have not placed your faith in Christ, hell.
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.860]   There is no alternative.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.260]   There is no in-between.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.340]   There is no purgatory.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.860]   There is no annihilation.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.500]   You will not cease to exist.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.300]   Hell.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.980]   This is serious.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:34.420]   If this is truth, and if you believe this, then you should be thinking about hellbound
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:40.500]   people right now.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:45.380]   And so salvation, we talked about before what salvation is not.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:51.140]   Salvation isn't rescuing us from a bad life or being poor or a horrible breakup or anything
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.380]   like that.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:22:00.220]   Salvation is rescuing from God's furious wrath against sin and evil in light of his ultimate
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:05.520]   holiness.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:11.780]   Sinfulness is not just human error or human trials, but it's deep, pervading, cancerous,
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:16.020]   festering, terminal sin.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:24.780]   We are dead in sin, we are helpless to it, we are hostile towards God in it.
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:28.220]   And so this is humanity's greatest problem.
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.020]   This is humanity's greatest problem.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:34.220]   Can you guys read it?
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.500]   Sorry.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.500]   That brings us to our third point.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.540]   Here's the good news, right?
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.420]   We know this now here at Berean.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:44.060]   Like Jesus time!
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.460]   By this point, your heart is like weighing down and getting heavier and heavier and heavier
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:52.140]   and then it's like Jesus!
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:58.820]   Galatians chapter 4 verse 4 says, "At the right time, God sent forth his son Jesus."
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.500]   God sent Jesus as the answer.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:06.220]   In Romans 5a, it says, "While we were still sinners, while we were in the depths of that,
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:12.860]   while we were mired under the weight of the standard of the holiness and wrath and ferocity
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:17.780]   of God, Jesus came and he died for us."
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.780]   Because why?
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.780]   Because he loved us.
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:24.580]   How do you love someone unlovable?
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.100]   And more than that, how do you love someone unlovable to the point where you will sacrifice
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.660]   your life for them?
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.660]   Amazing.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.860]   John 3:16, "That whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.780]   And so by his perfect life and his death for our sins and his resurrection to prove his
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.380]   victory over our sin, Jesus gives his life.
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.940]   Salvation comes through Jesus' perfect life, that's the next point there.
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.780]   His death for our sins and his resurrection to prove his victory over our sin.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.140]   Let us see, the worst of sinners can come.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.180]   You cannot out-sin God's grace.
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:04.220]   We see this glorious gospel scene in Isaiah chapter 1 verse 18, it says, "Come now, let
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.100]   us reason together," says the Lord, "though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.460]   as white as snow.
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.980]   Though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool."
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:19.060]   In Isaiah 43-25, "I am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and I will
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:27.980]   not," listen to this and let it just marinate in this truth, "I will not remember your sins."
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:28.980]   Praise God, yes?
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.980]   Oh my goodness, look at that.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.980]   "I will not remember your sins."
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.180]   That should make us weep.
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.180]   This is what God offers the world through his Son.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:48.460]   So there it is, God, humans, Jesus, and now we get to the fourth part.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.660]   This is where the rubber meets the road.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.580]   Now here's the thing, let it read there, "Many people are in hell who have heard and mentally
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:25:01.380]   assented to the above message."
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:10.900]   Many people are in hell who heard and mentally assent to the God/Man/Jesus message.
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.340]   This is scary.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:21.100]   Letter B, "Many people stand at the line drawn on the sand and cannot decide whether or not
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.780]   to cross over that line.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:29.060]   Ultimately, this is the same as not crossing over at all and remaining in the clutches
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:38.220]   of hell."
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:42.200]   There are many people who are in churches today who just sit and falsely worship sitting
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.660]   behind this line.
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.820]   And this is where a lot of confusion happens because one might believe these things, you
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.700]   guys see my air quote?
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.620]   One might believe all these things but never understand what to do to cross over the line
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.540]   and make that step.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:08.740]   God beckons, He calls, the question being then, not only what do we believe as believers,
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.700]   but how do I cross into that?
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:15.980]   And I think that's the burning question when we think about genuine conversion.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.060]   How do you do this?
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:22.860]   You've read the contract that God sets before you, this is the truth, and you have to sign
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.620]   on the dotted line.
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:30.940]   Many of you guys can attest to the point that you've heard the gospel before, maybe in youth
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.300]   group or elementary school or things like that, and you were just sitting right on that
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.180]   fence.
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:42.860]   And your life began to change and you began to see fruit when you crossed over and said,
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:49.380]   "I give my life for this truth."
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:56.180]   This is the difference, there is a difference between what God does and what we do, so this
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.460]   isn't part of your worksheet but I want to make it clear that God is the one that does
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:04.820]   the electing, calling, regenerating, converting, justifying, adopting, and reconciling.
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:05.820]   What are we called to do?
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.180]   That's His part in salvation.
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:11.940]   We are called to repent and believe.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.460]   We'll keep it very simple.
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.060]   This can become very complex but let's keep it very simple.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.900]   Repent and believe.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:26.940]   That is how you cross over that line.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:32.220]   Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.860]   to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.180]   I'm going to read this again.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:44.980]   It's a heartfelt, this is deep, cutting, where your heart is just diced up.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:51.100]   You feel like a sword stuck through your chest.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.940]   Sin.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:28:01.860]   If you do not understand sin before a holy God, there will be no crying out for God.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:08.180]   There will be no need for you to step over that line other than fire insurance.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:14.460]   It's a heartfelt sorrow for sin and a renouncing of it, a sincere commitment, a commitment.
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.460]   We use that so lightly.
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.460]   Will you commit to this?
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.100]   Will you commit to this?
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.660]   Think about it like a marriage commitment.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:25.100]   It's a commitment to forsake this and walk in this, to forsake this world and to obey
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.180]   Christ.
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.220]   This is different from remorse.
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.980]   If you look at 2 Corinthians 7, verse 9-10, it says, "As it is, I rejoice not because
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.700]   you were grieved, but because you were grieved into repenting."
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.340]   Difference.
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:43.340]   You can grieve over your sin but there's a difference between that and grieving into
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.220]   repentance.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.000]   For you felt a godly grief so that you suffer no loss through us.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.220]   For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation.
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.180]   You see that?
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:29:00.940]   Without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death.
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.620]   So what is repentance?
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.500]   First it's acknowledgement.
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.900]   Your understanding that sin is wrong and that we reside before a holy God.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.860]   You're saying, I put these quotes because I felt like it encapsulates it in more layman's
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.860]   terms.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.940]   I get it.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.900]   I get this.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.140]   I understand the offense of sin before a holy God.
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.620]   I get that.
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.620]   Secondly, that moves us into agreement.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.220]   I agree with you.
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.300]   I agree with you God.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.400]   I agree that this is an offense, that this is sin.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.740]   Which moves us into a third part which is confession.
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:43.180]   You say, I did it.
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.620]   I did do this.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.540]   I am a sinner.
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:52.700]   You are, and that line there is, you are crushed by the reality of your sin and are drawn to
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:59.260]   confess under its weight.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.620]   So that whole idea of confession you can see in Romans, a lot of places, but in Romans
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:06.540]   chapter 10 verse 9 it says, "Because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.780]   and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.820]   There is confession that is needed in this.
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.340]   That moves us into the fourth point there.
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.060]   You ask for forgiveness.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:22.620]   So you've acknowledged it, you agree to it, you confess it, now you're asking for forgiveness.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.260]   So it's that question, very simply put.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:30.780]   You're coming before God and saying, "Will you forgive me?"
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:38.740]   It's funny how we can know about our sin, but we can feel grieved over our sin, and
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:43.700]   yet we never come before God and say, "Oh God, I'm really sorry.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:51.180]   I'm really sorry about this."
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:31:01.780]   You know, in asking for forgiveness, I want to make it clear that this is audible.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.820]   You're talking to God.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:09.660]   He's not some entity that floats around.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.780]   You're talking to him, you're saying, you're asking for forgiveness as you would in a relationship.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.300]   If you've ever had a friend who knows they did something wrong against you, but they
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:21.940]   don't say anything, they just know, and you know, they don't say anything.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.780]   A friend like this could even have confessed, like, "Yeah, I did that."
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.580]   But if they don't ask for forgiveness, there's always going to be this big elephant in the
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:35.380]   room that your relationship doesn't heal, it doesn't fix, until they say, "I'm sorry.
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.380]   Will you forgive me?"
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.340]   You're going to see that even clearer when you get married.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:41.340]   Oh yeah.
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:48.980]   Your wife is usually sleeping in the same bed.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.100]   When forgiveness is asked for is when the relationship can start being repaired.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.660]   And that brings us to the fifth part of repentance, is that you make a decision.
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:01.760]   There must be a renouncing of sin, and a decision of the will to forsake it and lead a life
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.540]   of obedience to Christ instead.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:14.660]   This is a 180 degree turn.
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:19.700]   Notice that this 180 degree turn is a decision.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.140]   It's not that you're perfect.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.340]   This is your resolve.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.620]   This is what I want.
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.620]   180.
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.620]   Not 179.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.620]   Not 181.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.860]   This is 180, right?
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:36.940]   All the way, you're beelining towards God.
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.980]   I saw the math majors right now go like this.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.860]   I get that.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.500]   It's a decision.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.140]   You acknowledge, you agree, you confess, then you ask for forgiveness.
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.460]   It brings you to this point of decision making.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.820]   At this point, it should be clear that you don't want to live the way you used to live.
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:59.100]   And this means that you make an active decision to change your mind, your emotions, and your
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.140]   will.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.020]   This is everything about who you are.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.020]   Don't get too caught up in those words.
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.260]   It's just everything about who you are, top to bottom.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.780]   Your mind, your emotions, and your will.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.100]   Everything changes.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.900]   And yes, that does mean your feelings change too.
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:22.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
