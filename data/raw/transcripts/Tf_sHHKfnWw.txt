[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.800]   Let's pray, everyone.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.360]   Lord God, we come to you, Lord, in prayer
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.280]   before each Bible study, recognizing, God,
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.720]   that there is the exercise and time
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.440]   that we need to spend over your word,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.320]   looking it over, observing, asking questions.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.720]   But also, we pray, God, that your spirit will illumine
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.280]   and cause us to see powerful and wonderful things in your word.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.920]   We also pray, Father God, that as much as we
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.880]   desire to have a learner's spirit and God,
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.160]   that we want to glean, Lord, we pray
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.520]   that you would help us in our both heart and our mind,
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.680]   God, that it would be washed by your word through your spirit.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.720]   And also, Father, as we study the passage this week,
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   God, sometimes it's difficult enough just to fight our flesh
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.080]   and even say no to our own desires.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.040]   And yet, we recognize there is a host of other distractions,
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.720]   temptations, and pressures that come from outside of us, too.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.280]   So in all things, Father, help us to truly be alert, sober,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.280]   and constantly walking with you.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.840]   We thank you for this time once again
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.840]   and lift up our song to you and praise and worship to your name.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.840]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.340]   Amen.

[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:52.720]   And sinners plunge beneath that flood,

[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:34.480]   The dying thief.

[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:58.360]   And there may I, though vile as he, wash all my sins away.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:07.320]   Wash all my sins away.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.280]   Wash all my sins away.

[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:33.520]   Okay, good evening again everybody. I just have two brief announcements for you
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.040]   guys. You know just as a heads up again that this Sunday we have our members
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:42.520]   meeting and just as a quick note number one if you're a member and you know that
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:47.200]   you can't attend we do have a little absence form. Look it up on your email
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:53.240]   and there'll be a couple links. Secondly because this Sunday is also the service
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:58.000]   fair please note that we're gonna have all of our service booths situated out
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.080]   in the courtyard and after the services they're gonna have handouts of
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.520]   information that you can just pick up or otherwise like previously after the
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.200]   membership meeting is done you can take time to visit with the reps from each
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:17.560]   team. I recommend that even if let's say you're not looking to volunteer for
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.320]   something immediately it's good just to be aware and informed about what's going
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.000]   on. You're gonna have opportunities if you're a parent to talk to some of the

[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:15.460]   If I can ask the people in the rooms to come back out.
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:18.300]   (people mumbling)
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:27.300]   (people laughing)
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:33.460]   Pastor Mark, Pastor Mark, Pastor Mark,
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:35.460]   do we need to check with them?
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.300]   (people mumbling)
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.140]   (people mumbling)
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.980]   (people mumbling)
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:13.980]   (people mumbling)
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:38.380]   Okay, is everybody out from the rooms?
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:41.220]   (people mumbling)
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:47.220]   Okay.
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:51.020]   All right, so there's 11 verses here,
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.520]   so obviously there's a lot to cover.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.980]   We're not gonna be able to get into too much detail.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.580]   I'm gonna just give you a highlight,
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:00.380]   spend most of my time in the first three verses,
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:05.380]   and then just an overview of verse four through 11, okay,
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.380]   and highlight some of the stuff that may be
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:11.380]   a little bit more difficult to understand, okay?
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.380]   Let me pray for us, and then let's get started.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:20.380]   Heavenly Father, we ask that you would guide us and lead us,
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.380]   that your word would speak to us,
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:26.380]   that you would give us clear understanding,
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.380]   that we would not turn from your word
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.380]   to the left or to the right.
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.380]   I pray that all our judgments, all our thoughts,
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:35.380]   all our emotions, our lives may be submitted to your word,
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:38.380]   so if there is any misunderstandings or our flesh,
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:42.380]   Lord God, that causes us to see things in a way,
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.380]   Father, that is not honoring to you,
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.380]   help us, Lord God, to be guided by your word and your spirit.
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:49.380]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.380]   All right, so I know you can't see this,
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.380]   those of you guys sitting in the back,
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:57.380]   but I wanted to give you a broad outline.
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:59.380]   Okay, you can't see, right?
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:03.380]   Yeah, I didn't want you to see, so it doesn't matter.
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:05.380]   Oops.
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:11.380]   Okay, so this week's text falls into three large categories.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:14.380]   I mean, you could have divided it into two, but you have...
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:34.380]   All right, give me a second.
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:37.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:40.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:43.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:46.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:53.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:59.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:03.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:10.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:13.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:18.380]   (laughing)
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:19.380]   Every time.
[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:22.380]   How do you get rid of the...
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:25.380]   Displace it, displace it.
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:26.380]   Huh?
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.380]   What, how did that happen?
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:33.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:39.380]   Slideshow.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.380]   Slideshow, right?
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.380]   Mm-hmm.
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:50.380]   How do you get rid of this?
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:55.380]   You wanted to just do a...
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:07:00.380]   So, I think I just go...
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:03.380]   From the beginning.
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:06.380]   Okay, hold on a second, let me...
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:09.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.380]   All right.
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:13.380]   Hopefully this works.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:16.380]   Okay, there you go, okay, thank you.
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:20.380]   All right, let's start over.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:24.380]   Okay, so you can divide this section into...
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:28.380]   Two large views, or three.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:31.380]   I divided it into three here.
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:36.380]   The first three verses, basically, description of the false prophets.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:39.380]   Okay, false prophets and false teachers.
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:44.380]   And here, example of God's judgment and...
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:48.380]   Sparing those who are righteous.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:52.380]   And then, he concludes with an encouragement here,
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:54.380]   "Then the Lord knows how to rescue the temptation."
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.380]   Right?
[01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:00.380]   So, the main point that he's trying to make here is it serves as an encouragement
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.380]   to those who are righteous to persevere, to pay attention,
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:07.380]   and it serves as a warning to those who are teaching false doctrines.
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:08.380]   Okay?
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:10.380]   So, that's kind of like the breakdown that I'm going to be going through.
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:12.380]   I'm going to spend most of my time in this section,
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.380]   and then I'm going to pretty much hurry through that,
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:17.380]   for the sake of time, okay?
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:22.380]   So, the first part of it, where it says, "False prophets arose among the people,
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:24.380]   just as there will also be false teachers among you."
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:27.380]   So, first thing, the guidance that I gave,
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.380]   if you looked at the Facebook last week,
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:33.380]   is whenever you see a list, it's good to kind of put them in order,
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:36.380]   so that you can see them, like, line by line.
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:40.380]   If you put it all in a paragraph form, sometimes it doesn't stand out the way it should.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:44.380]   So, whenever you see any kind of list of anything,
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:46.380]   put it in a way where it's easier to see.
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:48.380]   Separate each one, one by one,
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:52.380]   and sometimes you'll get better insight when you do that, okay?
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:56.380]   He starts out by identifying false prophets and false teachers.
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:09:00.380]   What's the difference between false prophets and false teachers?
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:09.380]   [inaudible]
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:12.380]   Okay, didactic. Okay, so false prophets,
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:16.380]   most likely is referring to the Old Testament prophets, right?
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:19.380]   Where they were declaring, say, "God told me this, I had a vision from God."
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:24.380]   False teachers are basically interpreting, like, interpreting the Revelation.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:28.380]   So, in the Greek, these two words, again, there's a lot of,
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:34.380]   if you have a good word study, I think I gave you a couple as an example.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:39.380]   If you have a good Bible program, it will save you so much time.
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:42.380]   Instead of flipping through pages, all you have to do is push a, like,
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:44.380]   if you had a Bible program, it says "false prophet,"
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:47.380]   and you just push a button, and then the Greek word would come out.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:50.380]   Even if you don't know the Greek, there would be English, you know,
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.380]   English version of that that would come out,
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:57.380]   and then it will give you the definition of that, word for word.
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:04.380]   So, I would highly recommend, right, don't drink boba for a week, use that.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:09.380]   One Disneyland ticket could get you two, okay, two Bible programs maybe.
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:12.380]   I would highly, highly invest, right?
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:16.380]   If you are, you're doing an inductive Bible study,
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:21.380]   having a good Bible program would literally save you, like, hours.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:24.380]   Because you just click of a button, especially the word studies, right,
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:26.380]   or cross-references.
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:29.380]   You just click of a button, and then boom, it will come out, right?
[01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:31.380]   You'll be able to go much deeper, much faster if you did have it.
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:34.380]   So, if you don't have it, I highly encourage you to get it.
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:41.380]   The Greek words behind these two words is "pseudo-prophetas" and "pseudo-didaskala,"
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:43.380]   teaching, okay?
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:47.380]   So, basically, they're false prophets, false teachers,
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:51.380]   and then he goes into the description of who they are.
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:56.380]   He says they will secretly introduce destructive heresies, first one, right?
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:02.380]   Why is it secret?
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:07.380]   Most likely, it's happening inside the church, right?
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:12.380]   So, if it was obvious that they're coming, that you know who they are,
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:19.380]   especially in our circles, right, you say, "Well, if they're teaching the health and wealth gospel,
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:26.380]   or they're, you know, the pastor or whoever is asking for $320 million airplane
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.380]   in order for them to preach the gospel."
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.380]   I mean, they're pretty easy to tell.
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:30.380]   They got purple hair.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:32.380]   They're on certain channels, right?
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:37.380]   So, they're not that hard to identify when they're outside, right?
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:43.380]   But they seek, it says that the dangerous ones are the ones who secretly introduce destructive heresy.
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:49.380]   You know, this word "heresy," right, "hereticus" in the Greek,
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:54.380]   there's a distinction between the two different type of words that describes false doctrine.
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:12:00.380]   One is "schism," which means where we get the word "to separate," right?
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:06.380]   This one, "heretic," the word itself literally means to have opinion,
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:09.380]   to have your own opinion, the word "heretic."
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:13.380]   So, the word "heretic" itself doesn't necessarily mean it's false.
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:18.380]   But a destructive heresy is somebody who is within the church, right,
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:22.380]   somebody who has doctrines that are off the wall, right,
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.380]   that we're going to have to pray to Mary to get to Jesus,
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:28.380]   or you're praying to, you know, Jesus was the brother of Satan.
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:30.380]   Those type of things are not within the church.
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.380]   Those are things pretty obvious outside the church.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:35.380]   Those are like you break off from those type of stuff.
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:41.380]   He's warning about doctrines that seep into the church that seem like they're Christian,
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.380]   but they're not, right?
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:47.380]   And that's why it says it's destructive heresies that are secretly introduced, right?
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:51.380]   It creeps into the church, and you have wrong thinking, wrong life,
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:58.380]   and it is completely contrary to sound doctrine, but it creeps in because it sounds right, right?
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:01.380]   That's what he's trying to really get them to pay attention to.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:08.380]   So the destructive stuff that comes into the church usually are not that obvious
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:11.380]   if you're not really paying attention, right?
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:15.380]   He said even denying the master who bought them.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:21.380]   So ultimately, all destructive heresies eventually lead to rebellion.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:25.380]   This word for master literally means a slave owner, right?
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:31.380]   And he's saying that we've been delivered from one master now to serve the other master,
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:39.380]   but a destructive heresy that's secretly introduced usually brings you away from submitting to the true God,
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:42.380]   and you end up ultimately serving yourselves, right,
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:46.380]   which is bringing upon them swift destruction upon themselves.
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:51.380]   So if you notice, one of the things that I ask you to do is look for words that are repeated, right?
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:59.380]   So this word destruction, right, destructive, destruction, or the word judgment.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:03.380]   Remember, if you go down the list, you probably, if you did this, you probably see, like,
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:06.380]   those are the two words that gets repeated over and over again.
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:14.380]   So throughout this whole text, the 11 verses, it's a warning against those who are bringing destruction into the church secretly, okay?
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:17.380]   And along with them, those who follow.
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:23.380]   He said, this is going to be so effective, he said, many will follow their sensuality.
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:33.380]   This word for sensuality in the English sounds like something sexual, and it could be, but it's a much broader term.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:39.380]   And so if you have other translations, you probably noticed that some of your translations says shameful, right?
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:42.380]   Or some of your translations says destructive.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:46.380]   Or the King James basically says a way of perniciousness.
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:53.380]   Any behavior that leads to, leads to destruction, judgment, right?
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:57.380]   He says, but many will follow their sensuality.
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:15:02.380]   It basically is describing somebody who's led by their flesh and not by the word, right?
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:09.380]   Remember how we talked about that in Romans chapter 7 and 8, and then we talked about that in the book of Galatians, right?
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:15.380]   Those who, those who, what, they invest in the flesh, they're going to bear fruit in the flesh.
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:18.380]   Those who invest in the spirit will bear fruit in the spirit.
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:23.380]   So some people who are following their flesh, whatever they desire, right?
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:28.380]   And they're going to be following them, they're also going to be led into destruction.
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:35.380]   Because of them, many, because of the way of, because of them, way of the truth is maligned, right?
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:39.380]   So, so much of criticism in the church today, right?
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:46.380]   So much, I'm not saying all of it, but so much of it is not against Christians, right?
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:49.380]   And I'm not saying Christians haven't made their mistakes.
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:56.380]   But so much of the criticism in the church are people who have the name of a Christian who are inside the church, right?
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:16:05.380]   Pseudo-Christians who are being led by their flesh, but especially in our generation where the line has not been drawn for the most part,
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:12.380]   because the churches have been working overtime to get everybody into the church no matter what, without any standards.
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:19.380]   And so some of you guys may have thought when you came to our church, it's so weird to have membership, right?
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:24.380]   Doesn't God welcome everybody? No matter what kind of sin you allow in your life, doesn't God welcome everybody?
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:29.380]   Isn't it about grace? And then, so there's no, there has been no line between the church and the world.
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:37.380]   So, so much of the criticism from outside the world comes not because Christians haven't been living a certain way,
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:39.380]   it's because there's non-Christians inside the church.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:46.380]   So I'm not saying everybody who sins is a non-Christian, but inside the church, many, right?
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:50.380]   Many have been following destructive thinking, right?
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:53.380]   And I'm going to mention some of that later.
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:59.380]   So we have to be careful that we're not quick to judge and say that guy's a Christian or that guy's not a Christian
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:01.380]   because he's not doing this or he's not doing that.
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:09.380]   But at the same time, if people are living by their flesh, they're denying the master, right?
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:17.380]   And they're following false thinking, it ultimately leads to maligning of the church and his, his, his gospel, right?
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:22.380]   And this is why God calls us to make sure that the church is holy.
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:29.380]   The church has to be a place of grace, but it also has to be a place of holiness, and neither can never be compromised, right?
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:33.380]   You cannot compromise holiness in order to be known as gracious,
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:38.380]   and you cannot compromise graciousness because you want to be known to be holy.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:41.380]   Neither is ever compromised in God.
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:48.380]   So he says that because of this, the church will be maligned, and their greed, ultimately, is their own greed.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:52.380]   And the word greed isn't simply talking about money, it's covetousness.
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:58.380]   Somebody who may not be greedy for money can be, can covet fame, honor, right?
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:02.380]   Prestige, notoriety, whatever it may be.
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:05.380]   He says their ultimate greed is themselves.
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:09.380]   They're not seeking to glorify God, they're seeking to glorify themselves in the name of God,
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.380]   and they will exploit you, take advantage of you.
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:14.380]   Who will they take advantage of?
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:17.380]   Right, now you can't see anything.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.380]   Who are they taking advantage of?
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:29.380]   People who are living by their sensuality, right?
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:35.380]   How do you get people who are living by their sensuality to follow false doctrine?
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:39.380]   If the false doctrine benefits you, right?
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:46.380]   If I start preaching a gospel that allows you to be comfortable living in your sin,
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:50.380]   who will embrace that?
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:53.380]   People living in sin, right?
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:59.380]   So when you're under guilt, you have two options.
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.380]   Either you repent of that guilt and come to Christ,
[01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:08.380]   or you will change your doctrine so that you don't longer feel guilty.
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:13.380]   So a false teacher will come in, and to do what?
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:15.380]   To tickle your ears.
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:18.380]   In order to leave you alone, right?
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:23.380]   So that you can continue to live in sin and still feel like, you know, everything's right.
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:25.380]   So all you've done is you haven't dealt with the guilt.
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:30.380]   So there's only two ways to get under guilt, right?
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:35.380]   Either you find justification in Christ by true repentance,
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:39.380]   or you justify yourself, right?
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:43.380]   So in order to justify yourself without repenting,
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:48.380]   you have to condemn whoever is causing you to feel guilty, right?
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:51.380]   So there's only two ways to get out of guilt.
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:55.380]   Justification by Christ through true repentance,
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:58.380]   or you start justifying your sin, right?
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:02.380]   And so he says, in their greeting, covetousness,
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:05.380]   they're going to come tickle your ears to exploit you with false words.
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:07.380]   They're not true, right?
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:10.380]   And that's why from the very get-go why we named ourselves Berean
[01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:14.380]   is because I've noticed, you know, early on,
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.380]   that people are not using the Word of God to come to truth, right?
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:22.380]   So we have a generation where we rely on catechism,
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:26.380]   where we rely on tradition, we rely on our discipler,
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:28.380]   we rely on whatever tradition that we came from,
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:30.380]   and we say, "Well, that's what I believe."
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:32.380]   And people are contested, "Why do you believe that?"
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:34.380]   They don't know, right?
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:37.380]   So it's not really you. You're relying on tradition, right?
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:40.380]   You're relying on your group thought,
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.380]   but it's not based upon the Word of God.
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.380]   Sometimes if you are faithful to the Word of God,
[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:47.380]   you will find yourself alone,
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:50.380]   and that's exactly where you should be, right?
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:54.380]   But when you are constantly concerned about staying with the group,
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:59.380]   that in itself is sensuality, right?
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:03.380]   Because your desire to be accepted by the group that you're in
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:08.380]   won't allow you to accept doctrines that will take you away from that, right?
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:11.380]   Sometimes God will take you away from that
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:13.380]   because people are going astray.
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:16.380]   So you have to test the Word of God, right,
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:19.380]   to make sure that every thought you have, every behavior you have,
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:22.380]   is according to God's Word, right?
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:25.380]   It's that their judgment is from long ago, is not idle,
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:28.380]   meaning that God is not just sweeping it away.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:31.380]   It may seem like they're getting away with it,
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:33.380]   and they may be getting notoriety,
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:35.380]   maybe they're becoming rich and famous,
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:39.380]   but at the end of the day, it says God's hand is on them actively.
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:42.380]   You just may not see it, okay?
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:47.380]   So these are all descriptions, not only of a false prophet or false teacher,
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:49.380]   but those who follow these false teachers,
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:51.380]   and that's why he says to watch out.
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:55.380]   So anybody who's living continually based on his sensuality,
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:22:01.380]   sensuality doesn't necessarily have to be something evil, right?
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:06.380]   It could be bitterness, anger, right?
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.380]   It could be coveting.
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:11.380]   It could be self-righteousness, right?
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:18.380]   All of those things are open doors for satanic presence in your life
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:23.380]   because these are things that God wants us to repent of and put behind us,
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:27.380]   but when we allow it to linger in our lives,
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:34.380]   those things will cause you to accept certain doctrines and reject certain doctrines, right?
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:37.380]   You emphasize certain things and de-emphasize certain things,
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:40.380]   not based upon the Word of God, but based upon your own prejudice,
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:42.380]   that this is what you want to maintain,
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:45.380]   so these things are from God or these things are not from God.
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:51.380]   That's why Jesus says the very first step of truly living is what?
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:54.380]   To die, right? To die.
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:57.380]   If you are seeking to live, you will die,
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:01.380]   but if you die because of Christ, you will really live.
[01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:09.380]   So the beginning of true life is recognizing our own life needs to be put away, right?
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:11.380]   In order for us to receive new life in Christ.
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:16.380]   Otherwise, whatever it is that you are holding on to blinds you, right?
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:18.380]   And you say, "Well, I don't think I'm blind."
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:20.380]   Of course, if you're blind, you're not going to think you're blind
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:24.380]   or else you wouldn't say you're not blind, right?
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:28.380]   How do you recognize that? What's in your heart?
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:30.380]   What's in your heart? What are you pursuing?
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:32.380]   What will you not let go?
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:36.380]   And that's a source of your weakness, okay?
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:39.380]   The second part where he gives us three examples.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:42.380]   I said two examples, but they're actually three, right?
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:47.380]   First, he says the angels, and then he says the ancient world,
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:50.380]   and then he says the city of Sodom and Gomorrah, okay?
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:52.380]   So you notice there's three things.
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:54.380]   Like why did he choose these three examples?
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:57.380]   You notice the degree in each one?
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:02.380]   The angels individually is as high as you can go, right?
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:09.380]   So he says if God's not going to spare even an angel when they rebel, what is he saying?
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:12.380]   The point is not look at the angels and study, like, how did they fall?
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.380]   What did they get judged?
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:17.380]   What is the point of this, what he's saying here?
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:22.380]   If God didn't even spare angels, of course false prophets aren't going to be spared.
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.380]   That's the point, right?
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:26.380]   So judgment is going to be carried out without prejudice.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:28.380]   That's the point that he's trying to make.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:30.380]   He says they spare the ancient world.
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:34.380]   The whole world got wiped out, right?
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:40.380]   He's saying clearly, so that's why if you're in a large crowd and you feel safe
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:48.380]   because a large number of people are thinking the same way, right, you should remember this verse, right?
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:55.380]   There have been periods when everybody was wrong, where everybody is under judgment, right?
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:25:03.380]   So it's kind of hard to imagine when the Bible says that the road to destruction is wide, right,
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:08.380]   and the road to life is narrow and few would be found on it.
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:11.380]   But how few?
[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:17.380]   We don't know exactly how few, but we know that when Christ went to the cross,
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:22.380]   majority of the people, even though he spent three years doing public ministry,
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:26.380]   preaching the gospel, and everybody said he must be the Messiah, he raised Lazarus from the dead.
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:31.380]   And when Jesus went to the cross, very few followed him, right?
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:37.380]   Now, would that be, we don't know exactly what the number is, but that is still true today, right?
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:42.380]   He said narrow is the gate that leads to eternal life and few will be found on it.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:47.380]   So he says the ancient world and then the city itself, Sodom and Gomorrah, right?
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:53.380]   So you see kind of like that individually, the world, and then specifically the city.
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:56.380]   So I think he highlights these for a reason, right?
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:26:00.380]   The angels, when they sinned, was cast into hell.
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:02.380]   So I'm not going to go into every part of this.
[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:06.380]   The word hell here is not Gehenna, is not Sheol.
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:07.380]   Those are the two words.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:14.380]   The Sheol is the Hebrew word that we typically think of hell, and then the New Testament word is Gehenna, right?
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:18.380]   But this word here for hell is only used here.
[01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:24.380]   And I'm not going to spell it out because I can't read it.
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:26.380]   Okay, well, let me spell it out for you, okay?
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:31.380]   It's not going to mean anything, but taratao.
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:34.380]   Okay.
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:38.380]   This is the only place in the New Testament where this word is used, right?
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:41.380]   So I'm not going to go back, go into the history.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:45.380]   Maybe some of you guys read it in your, I don't know.
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:52.380]   You're not supposed to look at your commentary, but if you did, you may have read it that this was a Greek mythological word.
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:27:00.380]   It was more of a cultural word, kind of like today if I said, you know, like if I said something and I said, "Oh, you know, you're going to end up in purgatory."
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:05.380]   Right? And if I say that, it's like, does he actually believe in purgatory?
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:09.380]   Right? Is he actually saying that he believes in purgatory?
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:12.380]   No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that you're going to be punished.
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:18.380]   But maybe the cultural word that everybody understands what purgatory means, punishment for your sins, right?
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:27.380]   So we don't know exactly what it means, but when you say he was cast into hell, if you were doing this study carefully,
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:33.380]   what's a question that you would have come up with this?
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:40.380]   Anybody had a question on this?
[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:46.380]   Are all the demons in hell?
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:50.380]   I think this is inductive study.
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:54.380]   Are the demons in hell today? All of them?
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:28:02.380]   No. Why? Why not? Where did you get that?
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:08.380]   Okay. No is good, but you could have followed that up, right?
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:14.380]   Huh? One third are in hell. Okay.
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:29.380]   I'm going to say one third fell. I'm going to ask you a third. I don't think they're in hell.
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:35.380]   Satan's the god of this world. He has demons. Right. When Jesus was walking on earth, what did the demons say?
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:40.380]   Why have you come before your time? Right? To torture us. Right?
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:46.380]   To send us to hell. So demons were walking around at that time. Right?
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:52.380]   So this couldn't be referring to all demons, right? All fallen angels who have been sent to hell.
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:56.380]   So this is something a lot more specific than that. Right?
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:29:01.380]   So we don't know. We don't know exactly what it is. There's a lot of guesses.
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:08.380]   Some believe that this is in reference to Genesis chapter 6, Jude 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:17.380]   I don't know if you guys read that passage, but if you looked up cross references, my guess is Genesis 6 and Jude probably 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 came out.
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:23.380]   In fact, I'm going to read Jude 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and then you'll see the parallel between this passage and that passage.
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:29.380]   But my goal today is not to get too deep into this. It's just to kind of explain why you're doing inductive Bible study.
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:35.380]   You should be asking these questions. Okay? Today, because of time, we're not going to get too much into it. Right?
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:43.380]   The ancient world, he said, Noah preached the preacher of righteousness. Is there a record of Noah preaching?
[01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:53.380]   Do you remember? No, there's no record of like Noah's public street preaching, telling everybody get in the boat.
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:57.380]   You know what I mean? Or you're going to die. There's no record of that. Right?
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:05.380]   They mock him. Right? God says to go in, lock up. He locks up. Rain comes. Destruction comes. The end. Right?
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:12.380]   But he's described as a preacher of righteousness. Preacher doesn't necessarily mean he is opening his mouth and preaching.
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:18.380]   His very presence was a witness of God's righteousness and holiness in his generation.
[01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:22.380]   But they call him the preacher of righteousness because of his life. Right?
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:30.380]   Obviously, there is a need for the physical preaching, the words being proclaimed.
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:38.380]   But sometimes when there isn't preaching in life, the preaching with words is nullified. Right?
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:45.380]   If your life doesn't represent the gospel that you want to preach, they're not going to take the gospel seriously.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:51.380]   Sometimes your life is much more powerful than any word you can speak. Right?
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:57.380]   Powerful meaning that it causes people to think and open up their heart, especially in our generation.
[01:30:57.380 --> 01:31:06.380]   Because there is a, there is a, already a prejudice toward the church. Right?
[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:10.380]   Hypocrites. Right? You say one thing and you live another.
[01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:15.380]   And so you have all these prejudices against the church or a lot of people who used to go to church who fell out.
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:20.380]   So we don't have a neutral culture that we're living in. Right?
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:25.380]   Either they're Christian or they have a positive view, some of them, because of their experience with other Christians,
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:30.380]   or many of them, as you probably know, have negative experiences in the church. Right?
[01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:35.380]   So in that context, there needs to be preaching of righteousness by our life. Right?
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:44.380]   In order that we can preach with our mouth. Here it says, he condemns Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction, having the example. Right?
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:50.380]   Ultimately, Sodom and Gomorrah served as an example. Example to who?
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:53.380]   The rest of humanity. Right?
[01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:58.380]   That when a society falls that deep into sin, God's judgment comes.
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:04.380]   People are saying that we are either there or getting there real quick. Right?
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:10.380]   As much as we are concerned about the state of, state of the world. Right? Right now.
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:15.380]   Like just the crazy things that are coming out right now. Right? Especially in California.
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:24.380]   I recently found out that they passed a law that young, I don't know how young, is it, correct me if you guys know,
[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:29.380]   like five, six, seven, eight, I forget how young, but pretty young, that if they want to get a sex change,
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:33.380]   they can get one without the parent's consent. Right?
[01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:40.380]   And I heard, and I don't know if this passed yet, but I heard that if a parent refused to give sex change to a child,
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:45.380]   they can actually come, child services can come and take away your children.
[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:49.380]   There's crazy stuff going on right now. Right?
[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:55.380]   And I've only mentioned one. If we kept on studying, I mean, this is where the time that we're living.
[01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:59.380]   I don't know if we're that far from Sodom and Gomorrah. Right?
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:04.380]   Maybe, maybe even beyond Sodom and Gomorrah, you know?
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:08.380]   So he says, this is serving as an example. We are living in a culture.
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:16.380]   But here it says, he says, he knows how to rescue a lot. He was oppressed by sensual conduct on principled men.
[01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:24.380]   Right? And then he says he was, his soul was tormented because of their lawless deeds.
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:33.380]   If we're living in the kind of culture that we're living in now, and our soul is not tormented by what we see,
[01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:42.380]   or we don't feel a sense of oppression and darkness around us, something's off.
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:52.380]   For us to hear that, to know that, that these are things that are actually happening, and it just doesn't bother us at all.
[01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:55.380]   Something's off. Right?
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:34:02.380]   So he says that Sodom, that Lot was a righteous man, and because he was a righteous man,
[01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:08.380]   he felt the oppression of the darkness around him, and he was tormented.
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:14.380]   Now, why is this important? Right? Because we need to pray.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:21.380]   And I know that right now, because of this evil in our culture, that there is a lot of movements,
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:26.380]   and a lot of things that are going on, the how do we combat this, that we need to have more people in office.
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:34.380]   All of these things are true, but I believe the very first thing that he calls us to do is to pray. Right?
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:40.380]   If you're tormented, first thing that we do shouldn't be marching. Right?
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:46.380]   If you're tormented by what's going on around us, the first thing that we should do is not simply to try to change legislation,
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:51.380]   although all of those things are important and essential, the first thing that has to happen is to pray.
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:58.380]   Call people to pray. Right? To pray, to fast. Right?
[01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:05.380]   Because this is not something that we can do simply by getting organized, simply by talking louder,
[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:09.380]   because this is a spiritual battle. Right?
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:14.380]   And so, again, I just want to highlight that as he is mentioning all of these things,
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:24.380]   that all of these things are here as an example, that before anything else, he said we need to come before God and pray. Right?
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:28.380]   I'll bring this back up later.
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:33.380]   He said, "And the end conclusion is, the Lord knows how to rescue godly from temptation,
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:45.380]   to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment, especially those who indulge in the flesh and its corrupt desires." Right?
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:56.380]   How many people are struggling with routinely going to porn? Right?
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:04.380]   I know this is an issue. I know this is a problem in every generation. I also know this is a problem in our church. Right?
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:10.380]   Because we live in this generation, the temptation is on your phone.
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:19.380]   If you just excuse that and say, "We all struggle. It's so hard." Right?
[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:25.380]   You are allowing yourself to continue down that path. Right?
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:32.380]   Your comfort, your ease is more important than your relationship with God. Right?
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:35.380]   There's no other way to say it. Right?
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:44.380]   This is something that if you continue to indulge in your flesh and your corrupt desires, there has to be a sense of urgency in our life.
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:51.380]   That beyond anything else that you're pursuing or you're concerned about, this has to be dealt with. Right?
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:55.380]   And it's not just about feeling guilty. Right?
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:37:00.380]   Because worldly sorrow, all it does is lead to condemnation.
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:03.380]   Godly sorrow leads to repentance and bears fruit.
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:09.380]   So in order to bear true fruit, we have to figure out how do I overcome this.
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:15.380]   But the worst thing to do as you are indulging in the flesh to excuse this. Right?
[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:20.380]   Because basically what you're saying is God is okay with this.
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:23.380]   But he's not okay with it. Okay?
[01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:34.380]   Because I guarantee you if you are living continually in this, Satan is already influencing your thoughts. Right?
[01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:44.380]   What you love, hate, how you listen to sermons, how you do Bible study, fellowship, your pursuits, desires, what makes you happy, what makes you sad.
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:50.380]   All of it is being influenced by this, even if you don't recognize it. Right?
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:55.380]   So again, for the sake of time, I'm going to move on. Right?
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:38:05.380]   But this is not something that a Christian could just excuse because you are actively heading down the wrong path. Right?
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:14.380]   And the Spirit of God cannot, right, guide you if you are constantly grieving the Holy Spirit in this. Okay?
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:22.380]   They despise authority. Usually somebody who's indulging in the flesh, they despise authority because they don't want to hear it. Right?
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:26.380]   Because typically it's the authority that's going to come and say, "Hey, maybe that's wrong."
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:31.380]   You're headed down the wrong path. So you end up despising authority. Right?
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:36.380]   Because people who are not authority are not going to be challenging you. Right?
[01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:42.380]   The Word of God is not going to come to you. But whoever's bringing the Word of God to you, you don't want to listen.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:46.380]   They're daring. This means bold. Right? Audacious.
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:53.380]   Meaning, in your sin, right, eventually you're going to despise authority because you don't want to hear it anymore.
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:57.380]   And then you're eventually going to become bold. Right?
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:01.380]   You say, "Oh, why? Why are they doing this? This is so judgmental. You guys are so legalistic."
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:06.380]   And then you double down on living that. Right?
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:13.380]   Self-willed. Another word for this is self-centered.
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:19.380]   Meaning, you don't care how to fix other people. You don't care if the Word of God is being maligned.
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:23.380]   Because you're okay. Right?
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:29.380]   So, self-willed. You see the progression here? Somebody who indulges in the flesh, despises authority, becomes bold,
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:35.380]   and he lives his life self-centered. As long as I'm okay, it's okay. Right?
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:43.380]   They do not tremble when they revile even angelic majesties. In other words, there's no fear.
[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:48.380]   Even though your soul should be tormented by the sins around you,
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:54.380]   even though there's sin that has crept in and you've allowed it, there's no sense of fear.
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:40:00.380]   No sense of urgency. Right? Because your heart has become calloused.
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:06.380]   He says, "Whereas even angels are greater in mind power, do not bring reviling judgment against them before the Lord."
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:13.380]   And again, I'm not going to go too deep into this. I would suggest that you go and read Jude 4 and on
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:18.380]   because it's a reflection of this. But at the end of the day, the application of this is
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:26.380]   there's a spiritual battle going on, and there is no sensitivity to their spiritual battle. Right?
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:32.380]   So we're not fighting against flesh and blood, but against principalities and power in high places. Right?
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:38.380]   And that's why he says to put on the full armor of God, and then he says, "Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray,"
[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:46.380]   at the end. Pray above all of this. Right? So either if you are continuing to live in sin,
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:54.380]   that you are, you don't have faith and you're just faking it, right? Or your heart's become so callous.
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:59.380]   Right? And you're embracing, "I like this. I don't like this. This is judgmental. This is not," you know.
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:05.380]   And then you've just kind of like created your own little God that is not consistent with what the Bible teaches.
[01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:13.380]   Right? And so he says he's warning them. Again, there's one theme in this whole text. Right?
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:21.380]   God never sweeps sin under the rug. He never sweeps sin under the rug.
[01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:27.380]   Because when God says it's going to be clean, it's going to be truly clean. Not appearance of cleanliness,
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:34.380]   but real cleanliness. Right? But the way he does that is through grace. Right?
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:40.380]   The way he brings us to righteousness is through grace. He says that God will forgive you.
[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:45.380]   No matter how deep, no matter how vile, no matter how difficult, he says,
[01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:51.380]   "If you are willing to fight against it, God will forgive you." Right?
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:59.380]   He's not saying like, "Get right or get out." He said, "No, you need to get right. That's why you need to come to Christ
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:06.380]   and admit it and bring it out. Confess it. Find forgiveness. Find accountability. Find true fellowship."
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:13.380]   Right? And so by the grace of God that we are led to holiness. Right?
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:20.380]   Otherwise, we are all susceptible to all kinds of heresies coming in.
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:26.380]   And usually the heresy that destroys us the most are not the obvious ones.
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:31.380]   Jesus is not God. He was never resurrected from Christ. It's not those heresies.
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:36.380]   It's usually the heresies like, "Oh, we're going to be gospel-centered.
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:41.380]   So therefore, every imperative is legalism or moral teaching."
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:50.380]   Well, that sounds great, but it's not biblical because that's not how the Bible teaches it. Right?
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:58.380]   Social justice. Doesn't Jesus want us to care for the poor? Isn't that pure religion? Right?
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:06.380]   And then you can, "It's not just the gospel. We got Jesus. God sent us here so that we can flip the world upside down,
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:11.380]   you know, and take care of poverty and racial injustice."
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:18.380]   He said, "Oh, doesn't that sound biblical?" He said, "No, God called us to preach the gospel.
[01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:23.380]   And if we preach the gospel, people's souls are saved.
[01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:28.380]   And when their souls are saved, saved souls deal with prejudice.
[01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:36.380]   Saved souls care for the poor. Saved souls, right, will fight for social injustice.
[01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:41.380]   But our primary call is to preach the gospel." Right?
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:45.380]   And a lot of times the false things that come in, it causes us to say, "Well, it's the gospel.
[01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:51.380]   Yes, it's the gospel, but it's not just the gospel. It's the gospel and this. It's gospel and that."
[01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:58.380]   And so when we begin to kind of, you know, turn left or to the right, it's because it seems right. Right?
[01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:08.380]   It seems right, but it's not. And the only way to be able to discern that is to pay very close attention to the Word of God.
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:13.380]   Right? Test everything. Test if what I just said is true. Right?
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:17.380]   That's why the Bereans were considered more noble in character than the Thessalonians,
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:20.380]   because they tested to see if everything Paul was saying was true.
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:24.380]   They put the Word of God at the highest standard.
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:31.380]   Not people, not their own prejudice, not their denomination, not their church, not their leaders, but the Word of God.
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:39.380]   Okay? All right. So let me give you the discussion questions for today.
[01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:43.380]   What are some false doctrines that you've seen propagated within the Christian circle?
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:46.380]   How were you able to identify them as being false? Right?
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:54.380]   Worst thing to say is, "I don't agree." Why? "I just don't think it's fair." Right?
[01:44:54.380 --> 01:45:02.380]   That's the worst way to come to a conclusion, because your sense of fairness is from a fallen point of view. Right?
[01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:11.380]   Okay. Let me not go off tangent. Okay. I got things to say, but I'm going to hold myself back. Okay.
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:18.380]   If you notice it, if you like something or don't like something, how did you come to that conclusion? Okay?
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:22.380]   Number two, have you had any major doctrinal shifts as a result of carefully studying the Bible?
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:27.380]   What were they, if any? Right? It doesn't have to be recent. It could be many years ago.
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:34.380]   Like, you had a paradigm shift because – not because a sermon that you heard, not because you were a part of a community,
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:39.380]   but you were looking at the Word of God, and the Word of God caused you to think differently. Right?
[01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:42.380]   Number three, should Christians be fearful of God's judgment?
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:47.380]   We are called to fear God, and yet in 1 John 4:18 it says that love casts out fear.
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:54.380]   How do you reconcile these two thoughts? Right? Clearly the Bible says both. Right?
[01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:57.380]   How do you reconcile these two things? You understand the question, right?
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:46:03.380]   And then four, how does the reality of spiritual world affect the way you live your life? Right?
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:12.380]   If you believe God is real, you believe angels are real. If you believe angels are real, you believe the devil is real, and the demons are real.
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:16.380]   If you believe heaven is real, you believe hell is real. Right?
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:23.380]   How does the belief in the reality of the spiritual world affect you?
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:26.380]   Does it cause you to be fearful? Right?
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:35.380]   When I first became a Christian, I lived in terror because I was saved in a charismatic circle, and they attributed everything to the devil. Right?
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:45.380]   The music is devil, the movies are the devil, you know, and I had a hard time waking up in the middle of the night because I was afraid I was going to meet the devil.
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:48.380]   No joke, you know, but it kept me sober.
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:56.380]   And later on, I realized that my fear was more based upon my prejudice of what I thought the devil was.
[01:46:56.380 --> 01:47:03.380]   And then the more confidence I had in the Spirit of God in me, it started to slowly drive out fear. Right?
[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:12.380]   But how does the reality of the spiritual world, the demonic world, the angelic world, does it cause just fear or indifference?
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:17.380]   Right? It just doesn't seem real, so it doesn't really affect you.
[01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:23.380]   Or soberness. That's why, again, let me just say something real quick, okay?
[01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:28.380]   That's why these scary movies are not good for your soul.
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:31.380]   Okay? Some of you might not like it.
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:39.380]   This is a… The reason why it's not good for your soul is because it desensitizes you to the demonic world.
[01:47:39.380 --> 01:47:45.380]   And so, because you're entertained by it, you know, it no longer seems real.
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:49.380]   It's real. It's real.
[01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:52.380]   If it's not real, what are you doing here?
[01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:57.380]   Why are you here every Wednesday studying a bunch of stuff that has no effect on you?
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:48:00.380]   What are you doing? Every Wednesday, what a waste of time. Right?
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:05.380]   Every penny that you spend, you could have had several Teslas. Right?
[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:08.380]   Why are you giving that to the church?
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:13.380]   Why are you going to weird places around the world to share the gospel? Right?
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:17.380]   It's because you believe it, right? You believe it. Right?
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:27.380]   But if you become desensitized to the spiritual world, yeah, it affects how you view your spiritual life. Right?
[01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:32.380]   So, I don't know how many of you guys are going to listen. Right?
[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:37.380]   But personally, like, I don't think it's good for your soul. Right?
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:40.380]   Because it does desensitize you.
[01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:45.380]   All right, let me pray for us, and then I'll get you in your groups.
[01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:48.380]   Heavenly Father, I pray for your blessing upon the small group time.
[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:58.380]   May it be fruitful and practical that all our discussion would not end in theory, but in application, Lord God, of what you convict us.
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:02.380]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:10.380]   [Silence]
