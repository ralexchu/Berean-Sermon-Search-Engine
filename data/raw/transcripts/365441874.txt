[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   Alright everybody, hope you guys had a good time of discussion and looking over the passage.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.080]   We'll draw our attention up here and then we'll start with our Bible study.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.920]   Let's, what I'd like to do is just read the passage, we'll take a moment to pray
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.360]   and then jump into the study.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.360]   Philippians 2, 19 through 30, and the passage says, "But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.880]   Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.520]   For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.160]   For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.360]   But you know of his proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.680]   like a child serving his father.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.040]   Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.360]   And I trust in the Lord that I myself also will be coming shortly, that I thought it
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.920]   necessary to send to you a prophet Dytus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.360]   who is also your messenger and minister to my knee.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.520]   Because he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.600]   sick.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.080]   For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.520]   but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.960]   Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly, so that when you see him again you may rejoice,
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.960]   and I may be less concerned about you.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.240]   Receive him in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high regard, because
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.280]   he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.000]   in your service to me.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.200]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.000]   Lord, we want to again thank you for the word, and God as we look at these model servants
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.400]   and people of the past, Father we want to all the more see the effect of Christ in their
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.520]   lives.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.080]   We want to see their faith in the Lord.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.480]   We want to see the outworking God of the transformation in their lives, so that God we would continue
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.320]   to learn to grow in our affections, in our resemblance of Christ, in our desire to further
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.240]   the gospel ministry, and so to this end God I do pray that you would help your word continue
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.720]   to challenge our lives.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.480]   We thank you it's in Christ and we pray.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   Amen.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.600]   Okay, so by way of introduction, you know I typically like to ask the question, how
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.920]   do we get here to this paragraph?
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.240]   What is the flow of thought is what I always ask, and what I like to highlight is this.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.920]   When we think about this current section where Apostle Paul highlights two individuals in
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.160]   his life who are essentially model servants, we ask the question how did his thought get
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160]   there?
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.440]   Well remember that in chapter one, Apostle Paul in just kind of almost incredible fashion
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.240]   expressed his heart, expressed his desire, and what I like to say is he expressed his
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.000]   hope in Jesus.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.360]   And remember what he said is, "To my earnest expectation and hope that I will not be put
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.560]   to shame in anything, but that with all boldness Christ will even now as always be exalted
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:29.400]   in my body, whether by life or by death, for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.360]   And what was pretty amazing was that this hope, this hope of being a shining light,
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.560]   a hope of being an exaltation of Christ was something that helped him interpret or make
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.160]   sense of everything.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.960]   Make sense of the suffering, make sense of his current condition in life, make sense
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.000]   of why he could have joy within the circumstance.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.960]   And so he spent a lot of time in chapter one talking about this incredible hope that carries
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.840]   through to the rest of the passages.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.400]   And then in chapter two, he commanded and encouraged that we should have this attitude,
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   right?
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.680]   Remember that if there is any encouragement and if there's any of this, he says, "Make
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.200]   my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit,
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.040]   intent on one purpose.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.460]   Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.760]   as more important than yourselves.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.320]   Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.560]   others.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.060]   Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus."
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.520]   So he describes that this attitude of humility, this attitude of self-sacrifice, selflessness,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.080]   this attitude that is found in Jesus where he did not regard his deity to be grasped
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.080]   and held onto, but he emptied himself.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.600]   He says, "You have that."
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:03.720]   And then in the last passage that we studied two weeks ago, he said for us to join in this
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.600]   work.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.640]   What he says was, "But even if I'm being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.240]   and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with all of you.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.400]   You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me."
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.200]   And if you think about it, when Apostle Paul ended the last paragraph by saying, "Share
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.120]   this joy with me," right?
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.920]   He wasn't just saying like, "Be happy, man," right?
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.640]   That's not what he was saying.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.720]   He's actually all that he was saying from chapter one till now, he wants them to experience
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.160]   the full gamut, which means then, yes, joining in the hope that is in Christ, joining in
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:51.160]   the attitude that is with Christ, but also then the work of Christ that involves suffering,
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.360]   self-sacrifice, a desire to minister to the people around and considering their, right,
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.920]   their interest in welfare far above and beyond your own.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.800]   And so it totally makes sense that as his mind is there saying, "Join me, share this
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.000]   joy," he presents to you two case examples of two individuals who are walking with him
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.760]   sharing this joy, right, which is Timothy and Epaphroditus who have this hope in Christ,
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.500]   who clearly has this attitude of the Lord and is engaged in the work of our Savior.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.940]   And so I wanted to give you that introduction just to show you that this isn't just this
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.440]   random move into, "Hey, these two guys happen to be working, can you guys make sure to receive
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.880]   them?"
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:41.120]   His flow of thought actually is seen in all of this, where he began with this idea that
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.560]   the exaltation of Christ should be at the forefront of his mind.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.080]   Now as I think about that, as we think about this, and we just read the passage, I want
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.320]   to introduce this idea, right, that Apostle Paul, he is clearly thinking about the well-being
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.120]   of the church.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.360]   So although he's presenting two case model servants who are exemplifying hope in Christ,
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.920]   attitude of Christ, work of Christ, he himself also is still showing forth his care and love
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.920]   for the flock, right?
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.840]   And as we do that, one of the questions I asked you to prepare for this, tonight's study,
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.880]   was this idea of as Apostle Paul is seeking to send these servants and we see his attitude
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.360]   towards the church, what kind of principles or what is being said then about his attitude
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.900]   and mentality towards the church?
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:38.000]   And so clearly, we're going to kind of unpack this idea of all three men, Paul, Timothy,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   and Epaphroditus.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.680]   They show this genuine concern and they show that concern with an incredible level of self-sacrifice.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.840]   And so when we think about individuals who should be at the forefront of caring for ministry,
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:08:00.400]   leading the flock, it should be those who are willing, absolutely willing to sacrifice
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   and lay down whatever it is they have for the sake of the interest of the church.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:11.080]   All right, jumping into this first section, okay?
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.560]   So this passage nicely divides into first section about Timothy and then the second
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.160]   section about Epaphroditus.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.880]   Let's take a look at this first section.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.920]   Starting from verse 19 through 22, let's take a moment to reread the passage and he says,
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:32.960]   but I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly so that I also may be encouraged
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.820]   when I learn of your condition.
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.320]   So we regularly get this idea that Apostle Paul was constantly checking up on how the
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   churches are doing.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.600]   I want to hear this, I want to hear your faith, I want to hear your works, right?
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.560]   And that's a sign of genuine care.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.920]   Verse 20, for I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:56.680]   your welfare, for they all seek after their own interests but not those of Christ Jesus.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.560]   But you know of his proven worth that he served me in the furtherance of the gospel like a
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.360]   child serving his father.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.440]   Therefore, I hope to send him immediately as soon as I see how things go with me.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.600]   And I trust in the Lord that I myself also will be coming shortly.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:22.040]   Okay, as we take a look at that passage, we see a lot of Apostle Paul giving, you know,
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:27.400]   highlighting the noble character and commendations of Timothy's character.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.240]   And so I ask what are some of these character traits that Apostle Paul highlights?
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.160]   What are some of these character traits?
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.160]   Well I highlighted those things in green for you guys, the things that I saw.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.120]   You can highlight this idea of like he's got this kindred spirit that's really basically
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:48.440]   like-minded with Apostle Paul, genuine concern, proven worth, and he served the furtherance
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.020]   of the gospel like a child serving the father.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.720]   Let's take a moment to talk about each one of those things in a little bit more further
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   detail.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:02.080]   First, when we think about a kindred spirit, okay, the way I outlined it is what he does
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:08.640]   is he gives one main character trait and he gives a little further explanation of it.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.960]   He begins by saying he has this kindred spirit.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:18.780]   And the whole idea there is that there is this like-mindedness, right, that as Apostle
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:25.760]   Paul has this like, you know, singular drive to exalt Christ, as Apostle Paul is interpreting
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.560]   all that's happening in his life, including the suffering, and he's finding joy in it,
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.400]   right, he's saying Timothy has this same worldview.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.040]   Now let me ask you this interesting question.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.720]   How difficult do you think it is to find somebody who's going to have the exact same worldview
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.320]   as Apostle Paul?
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.760]   Where you're experiencing persecution, the confiscation of your rights, currently he's
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:53.640]   being held unfairly, they don't have a legitimate accusation, but he's held in Roman prison
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.960]   for a long time.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.760]   They kind of don't know what to do with him, right?
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.600]   Within all of that, his perspective is joy.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.660]   His perspective is look at these opportunities to share.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.600]   His perspective is I am counted worthy to share and exalt the glories of Christ.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.040]   Join me, right?
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:16.160]   I mean, how difficult is it to get somebody to be on that exact same page?
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.600]   What Apostle Paul is saying is, dude, Timothy is not missing a beat here, he's right there
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.720]   with me.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.440]   He's got this kindred spirit, right, where he's not focused on himself, where he's not
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:33.280]   focused in on woe is me, shouldn't God help me get out of this, why do we have to X, Y,
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.400]   and Z, but actually he's thinking about and being concerned for the well-being of the
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.160]   flock, right?
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   So in that, he says that Timothy is of kindred spirit having this genuine concern for the
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.440]   welfare of the church.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.600]   And so this is kind of like an interesting question we should stop at and put a stake
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   in.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.720]   And for your discussion later, there will be this question.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:07.080]   When you think genuine concern as opposed to superficial kind of light concern, what
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.640]   are the definitive markers?
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.760]   Meaning what's the difference between just having a care for somebody, just like let's
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.160]   say, you know, it's like, oh, I care about everybody here at church versus something
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.840]   that's really genuine.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.420]   What are the characteristics of a concern that goes above and beyond, right?
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.920]   Those are some things that we should talk about.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:29.960]   But we want to highlight and look at the passage and see that Apostle Paul contrasts this genuine
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:38.040]   concern with verse 21, "For they all seek their own interests and not for Christ Jesus."
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:44.280]   You know, when I was making observation of this passage and I was trying to connect this
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.800]   whole idea, I just realized like, you know, Apostle Paul, again, his thoughts in the letter
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.080]   is all connected.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.040]   Earlier, he said, "You need to have this humility.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.220]   Don't be looking out for your own interests, but look out for the interests of others."
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:04.400]   And then I started asking myself, "Hmm, what are some moments in specific cases where I
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.480]   was trying to care for somebody, but my own self-interest got in the way?"
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   Right?
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   And we should think about that.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.760]   What are some moments and times when you are trying to care for somebody or you're already
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:21.560]   in a position where you're expected to care for somebody, but then your own care for yourself
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.560]   started to get in the way?
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.400]   And I started thinking about some examples, right?
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.440]   So there are times when you are trying to help somebody, maybe you're trying to advise
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.480]   someone in their life decisions, and in those moments when they're not listening, you get
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.480]   all frustrated.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.520]   You're like, "Oh, aren't you listening to me?"
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.520]   Right?
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.760]   Do these apostles, have they ever experienced that?
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.760]   Of course.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.140]   Almost every city they get into, there's this frustration.
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.320]   People don't listen.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.240]   People aren't paying attention.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.680]   There could be a moment when you just go, "You know who I am?
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.720]   Aren't you listening?"
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   Right?
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.920]   Or have you guys ever experienced a moment when somebody's maybe asking you advice, they
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.080]   don't listen, but then they go ask somebody else because they think somebody else might
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.240]   have better advice, and you're sitting there thinking, "What?
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.120]   Why did you ask me if you're going to go ask somebody else?"
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.560]   Have there been moments when you got super offended because somebody maybe you've been
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.360]   caring for, maybe it's a younger sister, maybe it's a younger brother, maybe it's your little
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.000]   family or whatever it may be.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.600]   Your family, so you should know, but they don't tell you, and you're all offended.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   "You didn't tell me?"
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.760]   You know, there was this moment actually when somebody came to me and started apologizing,
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.760]   "I'm so sorry."
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.760]   And I was like, "Why?"
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.120]   It's like, "I started dating and I didn't tell you."
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.800]   And I just took this moment, and I don't know why something came over me, and I just started
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   kind of messing with them.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.680]   It's like, "You didn't tell me?"
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.200]   It's okay, you don't have to tell me.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.120]   But there are those moments when if, let's say you're close to somebody, but they don't
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.360]   share with you, all of a sudden you're like, "Who am I to you?
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.440]   You told everybody else but not me."
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:04.120]   What I'm talking about is these case moments when your own thought of yourself reacts.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.480]   Your own consideration of your value within that whole scenario of caring for somebody,
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.480]   it reacts.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.480]   "Why don't you tell me?
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.480]   Why aren't you listening?
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.060]   What about me?"
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.600]   Remember the moment you say, "What about me?"
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:20.840]   All of a sudden, that distinction of genuine care begins to get muddied.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:27.440]   And then I started thinking, "Well, I don't know that I necessarily struggle in that way.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.840]   I don't have an issue.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.840]   I don't have an issue.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.560]   If you want to date, you can come to me for advice because I love giving advice.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.760]   But it's not like you have to cross-check everything with me."
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:43.800]   But then I started asking, "What in me, as a self-interest, prevents me from genuinely
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.440]   caring for somebody?"
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.560]   And one of the moments that I had, I just had to confess, was typically for me, is I
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:57.440]   shy away from sharing or saying what I need to because I worry whether you'll like me
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.800]   still.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.520]   Like if I'm honest, and this is just me being honest with you, perhaps some of the other
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.000]   stuff of like, "I need to know.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   You need to listen to me.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.680]   How come I'm the one always buying coffee?"
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.960]   Those are the things that I just really don't care about, right?
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.400]   But what I really care about is, if I say this, then what if you stop coming to me,
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.400]   right?
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.800]   What if you react in a way where you're defensive?
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:29.200]   What I wrestle with is my consideration of myself and the future, am I going to say what
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.000]   you need versus what you like?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.200]   Honestly, that's a hard thing.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.720]   And I got to say, sometimes that kind of struggle, it doesn't even hit me until later, right?
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.040]   It's like, "Oh, I should have said."
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.280]   I should have said.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.960]   And then I got to go to the Lord and say, "Hmm, you know, Lord, the biggest hurdle wasn't
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.360]   even their defensiveness because they weren't even defensive to me.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.360]   I just assumed.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:59.760]   And in my fear and assumption, I didn't say what I needed to say."
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.480]   So this is important.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.480]   You know why?
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:08.680]   It's because we take notice of the fact that in verse 21, when he says, "They all seek
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:16.520]   after their own interest," it's not just about the interest of the two parties involved.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.600]   It's about the interest of those two parties in the context of Christ, what Christ is wanting
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.000]   for their lives, what Christ is wanting for their sanctification.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.720]   And so that portion of it was incredibly convicting for me because Timothy, he's saying, is an
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.500]   individual who is genuinely concerned about your welfare, but clearly implied in that
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:43.440]   in contrast to the other individuals, Timothy is dedicated to the interest of Christ, right?
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.240]   Timothy is a young man, but we know from the other passages that Apostle Paul challenges
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.560]   him, "Don't let these other people diminish who you are because you're young, but rather
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:57.240]   speak boldly, preach the word, in season, out of season, give the truth."
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.560]   Why?
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.960]   Because he's supposed to be a servant of Christ, that he needs to do the work of the evangelist.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.880]   And Apostle Paul is saying, he has this genuine interest.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.840]   Wow, what a great commendation of a young servant.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:19.040]   What's more, he talks about how Timothy has a proven worth, and he says, "You know this,
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.520]   you've seen it," right?
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.640]   "That he served me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child."
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.040]   Let's talk about that a little bit.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:32.920]   When he talks about proven worth, he says that everybody knows of this.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:37.440]   And what's really interesting is some of you guys have asked, I got a text saying, "Huh,
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.960]   how come he says there's no one like Timothy?
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.680]   I have no one else like this."
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.720]   And isn't that unfair to everybody else, right?
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.520]   Because truthfully speaking, yeah, Apostle Paul had Silas, Apostle Paul had even Luke,
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.200]   Apostle Paul had Barnabas, lots of other people.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.680]   And you can imagine, if I'm in small group and I look over and I was like, "All I have
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.600]   is Garrett, and then nobody else."
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.840]   And then Jonathan's over there like, "What about me?"
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.440]   It'd be kind of weird.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:14.360]   What I'm saying is, yeah, Apostle Paul is not just using hyperbole just to be all dramatic.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.080]   Genuinely speaking, Timothy was a unique individual.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.960]   I've included for you an appendix at the very end of your packet.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.080]   So just turn your eyes there.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:27.840]   Timothy has gone through the journeys with Apostle Paul.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.920]   I have a map for you here.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.880]   His journey is incredible, right?
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:38.560]   You look at this and it actually kind of is mind-baffling.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.480]   What I want to highlight for you is that, I'm not sure if you can see my pointer, but
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:49.200]   here on this dot in Lystra is where Apostle Paul and Silas pick up Timothy.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.960]   This is where he gets converted.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.760]   But what happens is, in their journey, Timothy starts to follow and he travels all the way
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:01.080]   down that whole red path, all the way over to Ephesus, and that's where he remains for
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.120]   longer as Apostle Paul continues on ahead.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.120]   Think about that.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.960]   I mean, that journey is no small stretch of land.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.820]   We're talking like over 1,200 miles.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.820]   It's crazy.
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:18.360]   1,200 miles on foot, on boat, on donkey backs.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.360]   And here's the funny part, okay?
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.000]   I was thinking about what Timothy has gone through, and you see the journey.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.900]   We're not going to go over it for the sake of time, but almost all these churches that
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:32.440]   we hear of, all the churches that we have, the letters in the Bible, understand that
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.200]   Timothy was an integral part in most of those churches.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.200]   But think about this.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.380]   This part's going to be a little bit funny, okay?
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:49.160]   Before he begins this second missionary journey, Apostle Paul decides to have Timothy circumcised
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.340]   so that it wouldn't be a hindrance to him sharing.
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:58.360]   And then I thought, "Oh, dude, when Paul says, 'Dude, you know he's proven,' back of their
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:03.480]   minds are like, 'Dude, he got circumcised.'"
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.480]   I was thinking about this.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.760]   This is kind of meditating, like, number one, Timothy didn't know that he was going to go
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.760]   on this massive journey to this extent.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.120]   Clearly they were going to -- he was going to leave everything and go.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.040]   Timothy was down, proven.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.560]   Clearly he was following, right?
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.520]   He was following with faith, not knowing what's ahead, proving.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.840]   But to be willing to be even circumcised?
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.840]   I mean, I'm just being honest.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.040]   If I was him, I'd be like, "Dude, I just lie," and be like, "I got it, right?
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.040]   No one's going to ever know, right?"
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.140]   Like, do we really have to do this?
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.240]   I mean, just think about that whole idea.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.360]   And I know it's partially funny, but at the same time, it's like, clearly even as a young
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:53.680]   man, his willingness to serve the cause of the gospel was evident to the degree Apostle
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.600]   Paul could say, "You guys all know," right?
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.000]   So when Paul says, like, "Timothy is being raised up, and it's realistically so."
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.040]   He wasn't just one of just many people who did all the same stuff.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.240]   He was willing to go to great extents, great extents, to further the cause of the gospel.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:19.920]   Now, the other thing here is, though, when he says back in the passage that Timothy served
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.160]   him like a child with a father, I thought about that for a moment, and I just want to
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.400]   ask you this question, like, how should we appreciate that to a greater degree, right?
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.680]   Because I don't think it was just a cultural thing where, like, yes, they did have a kind
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:39.240]   of culture where they had mentors and disciples, and you had these significant figures who
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.480]   were teachers, and because, you know, they elevated, especially in that Greek culture,
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.880]   they elevated people with knowledge, so if they had knowledge, they would give them gifts
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.040]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.080]   But I don't think this was just cultural, right?
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.520]   Because it wasn't like, "Oh, yeah, you know, he really respected me as his instructor."
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.160]   He says like a son to a father, and that really challenged me.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.600]   I mean, it took me a moment.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.760]   I just had to kind of gather myself, because, you know, honestly speaking, I got to even
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.120]   ask myself, like, do I even treat my own father really well?
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:14.240]   My father's retired, he's older, he has some health issues.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.480]   Typically speaking in this generation, our parents complain, like, "You never call me.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.480]   You don't check up on me."
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.800]   And all of a sudden, I was like, "Oh, my gosh."
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:28.040]   You know, like, Apostle Paul and these servants of the Lord are checking up on people, seeing
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.560]   how they're doing.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.680]   We kind of live in a generation where our parents are being neglected.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.760]   It's months goes by and we don't even visit, right?
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.280]   Well, you got to ask the question.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.960]   If we are to care up and down, right?
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.480]   Timothy cares for the people above him.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.520]   He's not just being a brown-noser and a, you know, just a suck-up or something like that,
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.000]   like, "Oh, I want to be a leader, too, so I got to do this for you."
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.720]   No, he treats him like his own blood, like his dad.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.560]   And then clearly, he treats the people underneath him exactly the same.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.140]   He treats them like family.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.480]   And so what I see in this young servant is this amazing character trait.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.320]   He is loving them and being concerned for them, both up and down, no matter who they
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.520]   are.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.160]   What a servant of all.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.480]   And again, I can't necessarily give all the details of what that might look like, but
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   I want to challenge you.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.620]   Try to envision.
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:27.080]   You meet this individual who is a radical missionary, but you start caring for him because
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.480]   of the gospel he carries, because of the love that God is showing through him and building
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.280]   in you, you start treating this person like your own dad.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.280]   Could we get there?
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.640]   Do we know what that looks like?
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.720]   Do we know what that means?
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.120]   What an incredible challenge, right?
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:49.440]   So in summary, Apostle Paul really lifts up Timothy as a model servant who is, in summary,
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.360]   genuinely concerned for the welfare of the people and genuinely concerned for the interests
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.600]   of Christ.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.320]   And clearly he's willing, he's absolutely willing to go the distance and to lay the
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:07.960]   sacrifices down and to treat all those around exactly as Christ would, with a sense of selflessness
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.600]   and sacrifice.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.480]   Okay, we need to move on to the second section.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:20.600]   Here in verse 25 to 30, we move to Epaphroditus.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.320]   And I read the passage, this portion for us is, "But I thought it necessary to send to
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:32.080]   you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:38.680]   and minister to my knee, because he was longing for you, longing for you all, and was distressed
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.360]   because you had heard that he was sick.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:47.240]   For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only,
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.640]   but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:57.120]   Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly, so that when you see him again, you may rejoice,
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.960]   and I may be less concerned about you.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.960]   Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high regard, because
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:10.640]   he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.240]   in your service to me."
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.160]   Okay, a couple things about him, right?
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:21.360]   First, we think about the first section in verse 25, where he says, "I felt it necessary
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.840]   to you to send Epaphroditus."
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.520]   Just real briefly, Epaphroditus, cool thing, his name means charming, okay?
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.520]   Charming.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.520]   So, I don't know.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.120]   Alright, but the cool thing is, Apostle Paul gives him various titles, or I guess certain
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:41.600]   labels that summarize his role and his relationship with Apostle Paul.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.600]   What are those labels?
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.840]   He says, "My brother, fellow worker, soldier, messenger, and minister."
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.920]   Okay, I made a little chart for you guys there.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.480]   And the reason why I did this is because we don't have time to do it right now, but in
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:59.320]   your own time, you gotta think about what those things really represent, right?
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.440]   'Cause meaning, you don't just call anybody who's not your brother, like, "Man, you're
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.640]   like a brother to me," you know?
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.280]   'Cause you know what he's talking about is that kind of blood tie loyalty.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.280]   We're gonna be now in a certain relationship where it's gonna be thick.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.280]   It's gonna last.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.880]   No matter what happens here, we're not changing our status, yes?
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.560]   I'm not defriending you, basically.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:27.000]   What's more, he talks about there is this being a fellow worker, being a fellow soldier.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.120]   I mean, all of these things we could describe, but I want you to think about this, envision
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.120]   it.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.920]   There is levels of dedication.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.040]   There are levels, especially among soldiers.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:41.600]   When I think soldiers, I think, "I depend on you to cover me.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   You depend on me to cover you," right?
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:50.600]   Fellow soldiers also having mutual experiences, experiences that are incredible, experiences
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.920]   that are severe, experiences that are not the norm, right?
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.800]   And so there is this focus of intent, focus of purpose.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:02.200]   That kind of stuff is what I'm talking about, and we need to pay attention to those things.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:07.560]   Now, moving forward, I had asked this question, which was important.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:12.640]   Apostle Paul clearly says, "I really, really want to send Timothy to you, but I felt it
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.800]   necessary to send the prophet Titus," and the question is why?
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.960]   If he really wants to eventually get out of prison, and he has hopes, he's confident that
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:27.720]   things are going to essentially work out, and history has it, yes, in the second journey,
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.640]   after the second journey, there is this long period.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:36.360]   We're talking almost two years of imprisonment in Rome, where people, again, they're holding
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.240]   him without right reason, all that kind of stuff, but then he is released.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.560]   There's about three years from this time until the time where he actually gets executed,
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:49.960]   but within that time, he has opportunity to revisit the Macedonian area.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.760]   Scripture describes generally that he visited the Macedonian area, but it makes sense, prime
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.960]   location in Macedonia is Philippi, but in thinking through this, Apostle Paul says,
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.360]   "I want to send to you Epaphroditus," and we ask the question why?
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.020]   Well, it gives the reasons.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:14.160]   So going back to the passage, he says, verse 26, "Because he was longing for you all, and
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.080]   was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:23.320]   For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only,
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.200]   but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:33.760]   Therefore, I have sent him all the more eagerly, so that when you see him again, you may rejoice."
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.640]   This is pretty incredible stuff.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:41.200]   When you take a moment to slow down and think about this, what I'm saying is this, okay?
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.920]   Number one, what's really, really clear is that Paul felt the need to send Epaphroditus
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.520]   because Epaphroditus wanted to.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.040]   He loved these people.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.280]   He longed for them, right?
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.540]   He wanted to be in their presence.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:30:00.100]   He wanted to see them, and there was this desire in his heart to go to them.
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:05.200]   But I show you this map, and this map has the flight, airplane flight, the car, and
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.160]   this other stuff, because this is from modern day Google Maps.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.920]   But remember, Rome is over here, and Philippi is way over here.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.120]   This is close to 1,200 miles.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.240]   Here it has it in kilometers, 1,300, 20-something kilometers, okay?
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.040]   That's crazy.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:27.760]   Just the fact that he would travel this distance to be a minister to Apostle Paul, that alone
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.040]   is crazy.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   Why?
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.800]   Because what's evident is that the church, Philippi, loved Apostle Paul.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.320]   And what's more, in Apostle Paul's regular ministry, Apostle Paul was regularly giving
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.600]   financial help to churches that were in need.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.340]   He would carry gifts.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:48.740]   So what's more, those in the Macedonians were giving money both for Apostle Paul's ministry
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.200]   and for the sake of other churches.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.560]   Epaphroditus was carrying that over.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.880]   Think about Epaphroditus' character.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.880]   He is sick.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.440]   I'm guessing traveling this contributed to his sickness.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.880]   And if it was any one of us, we would have probably been tempted to stop right here before
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.840]   he hit the water, because traveling waters at that time was dangerous.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.040]   Maybe at this time, if he got really sick, he'd be tempted to stop, use some of that
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.440]   money for Airbnb and whatever it may be, right?
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.740]   Like that's what we would do.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.280]   That's what you would expect any normal person to do.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:24.440]   But what I'm saying is, in the highlight of Epaphroditus' character, he carried that all
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:29.240]   the way through, and then to go back?
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.000]   And then to go back, that's crazy.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.560]   But nonetheless, Epaphroditus is saying, "I want to."
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.480]   And Apostle Paul is in agreement with this.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.480]   Why?
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:44.560]   Because the church thought their dear messenger, their dear minister to Apostle Paul was sick
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.920]   and could have potentially died.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.240]   They don't have instant messaging.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.880]   It's like, "Arrive safely."
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.880]   "I'm here.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.880]   Don't worry.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.880]   Go to bed."
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.880]   Right?
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.080]   Like, there's not that stuff.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.320]   And so he sends this saying, "I want you to rejoice."
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.140]   Can you imagine that scene?
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:06.720]   If you send this man who is essentially kind of like cream of the crop of your church,
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.360]   Apostle Paul sees him as like a model, model servant.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.200]   And then that scene, if he comes back saying, "I successfully carried your message and gift
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.200]   to Apostle Paul.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.680]   Apostle Paul is doing well and sharing the gospel, and he's overjoyed."
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:24.280]   And when they see each other, what a beautiful sight that would be.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.200]   So what I'm saying here is this.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:32.640]   My goodness, if Epaphroditus was a lesser man, he wouldn't make this trip.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:37.040]   He would have been like, "Nah, I'd rather stay.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.640]   Plus, Paul, you don't have other help.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.840]   If I leave, who else do you have?"
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:48.960]   So again, commending Epaphroditus as a fellow servant or as a servant, he carries this.
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.200]   Now, one of the things I want to highlight before I start wrapping things up by way of
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.040]   conclusion, I want to say this.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:02.680]   In the description of why Epaphroditus wants to go, there's two.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:07.240]   He says there is a longing for you all, but there's also this.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:12.040]   He heard that they heard that he was sick.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:18.720]   Somehow the message got through that the church is worried because Epaphroditus is sick, right?
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.600]   I want you to think about that for a moment.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:28.440]   Have you met those people who don't want to be a burden so much to others?
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.160]   A, they're the people who are constantly saying, "Oh, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.440]   Oh, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry," right?
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.200]   And then there are those people who, because they're always like that, they get sick and
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.200]   they don't tell a soul.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.880]   And then you're all worried and you're all frustrated, like, "Tell me.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.800]   I can drive you to the hospital."
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.120]   You don't have to drag yourself over, but there are those people who are like that.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.520]   Now that kind of stream I don't think is good.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.680]   I'm not saying do that, okay?
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.200]   Because we need to be interdependent.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:03.800]   But clearly what's really interesting is Epaphroditus hears that they're worried and he wants to
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.080]   relieve their worry even though he's dead sick.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.320]   Do you see that?
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:14.920]   The concern and burden goes so deep that even though he's the one who's super sick, he's
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.280]   all the more worried about them.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:22.600]   Brothers and sisters, I want to give you this interesting challenge.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:27.280]   Sometimes in our love, one of the greatest things we're going to carry is incredible
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.560]   concern and burden.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.040]   Are they doing well?
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.040]   Right?
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.400]   Are they sick?
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.400]   Are they worried?
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.080]   Are they lost?
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.160]   Are they striving after the Lord?
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.000]   And sometimes we're super frustrated with the people we're ministered to.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.480]   It's like, "Why don't you get it?
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.080]   How come you're not changing?
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.440]   Like, how come you haven't fixed it yet?"
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.440]   You know?
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.440]   Why?
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.320]   Because part of that is their weakness is a burden on you.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:59.960]   But as a challenge to every single one of us, if we are to love, we're going to always
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.160]   carry the concern.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.120]   I'm worried about you, right?
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.200]   I'm thinking about you.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:10.720]   And that's one of the interesting things where it's not a physical pain, it's not a physical
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.880]   discomfort, but it's going to be internal, right?
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.880]   That their well-being is going to, especially if they're not doing well, it's going to bother
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.240]   you.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.640]   And so Epaphroditus reveals his affection for these people.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.680]   There is this real care.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.920]   Although he's sick, he's over here, he could have easily been like, "We're sick, man.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.640]   Send some more stuff.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.720]   We need money for medicine.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.720]   We need..."
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.640]   It wasn't like that at all.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.480]   He even wanted to travel that distance to relieve their worry.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.080]   That's pretty incredible.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:47.240]   And so by way of conclusion, Apostle Paul gives this command, "Receive them."
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.520]   We're not going to have time to go over all the details, but I'm going to wrap these things
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:56.920]   up by saying, "In so doing, in carrying these things, he's carrying the worry and distress
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.780]   and concern for them.
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:03.440]   And because he is like that," Apostle Paul says, "men like this," and it carries through
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:08.800]   both Epaphroditus, Timothy, and Paul, "men like this hold in high regard.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.480]   Men like this receive.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.720]   Men like this have joy with them."
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:18.800]   And so we ask this question, "How should the church regard these people?"
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:24.960]   Well, what I'd really like to say is, in all honesty, the point is not so much, "How are
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.480]   we supposed to honor these people?"
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:32.160]   Because that's a legitimate question because we don't want to put people on a pedestal.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.800]   Like, "Oh my gosh."
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.360]   Paul's still a man.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.240]   Timothy is still a man, right?
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.600]   And there are model servants in our lives.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.320]   They're just men, too, and women.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.600]   And we shouldn't necessarily put them on this false pedestal.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:51.880]   But nevertheless, there are people of noble character that we should elevate.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.320]   But for us, that's not too hard.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.320]   Why?
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:02.040]   Because naturally, we already give our ear and eyes to the people we admire.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.400]   But then the main question is, "What are we admiring them for?"
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.000]   Because they're eloquent?
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.520]   Because they're smooth?
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.280]   Because they're skilled?
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:16.280]   Because clearly, clearly, if they're productive, clearly if they're fruitful, clearly if they're
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.200]   successful, is that why?
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.040]   Paul's saying, "No.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.160]   These individuals are noble because of their heart of affection for you.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.600]   These individuals are noble because their care for you is genuine.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:32.320]   These individuals are noble because their love for the Lord is genuine.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.600]   They're willing to sacrifice.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:38.600]   They're willing to go, yes, clearly to death."
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.600]   What a challenge for us.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.920]   The people we admire, we're going to automatically listen to and emulate.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:49.480]   And the challenge therefore for us then is that's already natural in us.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.880]   We already try to be like the people we like.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.580]   The question is, "What are we actually looking at?"
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:02.560]   And so today we have, remember at the beginning I said, "These men are not above and beyond
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.560]   us.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.680]   What they have is the hope of Christ, the attitude of Christ, and they're engaged in
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.680]   the work of Christ."
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.400]   We, too, can do the same.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:17.560]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.640]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you, God, for your grace.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:30.100]   Lord, because all of us, we have this amazing privilege in this generation where you have
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:34.820]   sent your messengers, you've sent your servants, and then you've called every single one of
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:39.940]   us to be these things for one another, to be the caretakers of each other, to be the
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:44.540]   supporters, encouragers, and edifiers of each other.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.980]   And so, God, we thank you that you as our Heavenly Father, you've looked at your children
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:54.460]   and caused us, Lord, to have the maturity that you want us to have, and you've inspired
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.820]   us, Father God, to do all the more.
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:00.380]   I do pray, Father God, that every single one of us will be challenged in the way that we
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:04.060]   love, and we'll challenge in the way that we love each other.
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:09.220]   And I pray, Father God, that although, yes, we struggle with our own selfishness, although,
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:15.380]   yes, Father God, our hearts are sometimes so mixed, we do pray for your sanctifying
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:20.060]   work, that God, our care for you and our care for the church will be pure.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.060]   We thank you, it's in Christ, and we pray.
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:21.060]   Amen.
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:21.900]   Amen.
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.720]   [ Enjoying the comfort of your new computer. ]
