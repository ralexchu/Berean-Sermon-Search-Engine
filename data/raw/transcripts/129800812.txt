[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.160]   So if you turn in your Bibles to chapter 1 and then we look at verse 10, this is where
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.600]   he addressed that first problem.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.720]   The first problem was division.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.280]   And he said, "Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.560]   you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you may be complete in
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.040]   the same mind and same judgment."
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.040]   Right?
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.480]   So he began with that exhortation.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.320]   And the next section in verse 18, he said, "For the word of the cross is foolishness
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.840]   to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God."
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.160]   Okay?
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.400]   And I made the case to you last week that Apostle Paul is presenting an argument saying
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.240]   the gospel that we have is superior, it's greater, it's profound.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.380]   Right?
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.840]   And in so doing, you realize he is exhorting them to be united because the gospel already
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.120]   has done a dividing work.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.200]   Okay?
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.680]   The gospel has already divided all of mankind into two categories, those who are perishing
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.720]   and those who are being saved.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.360]   And so we are those who are being saved, bound together by this gospel truth, this wisdom
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.360]   of God.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.360]   Right?
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.720]   So he's saying we need to be united.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.920]   We can't have this kind of division amongst us.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.240]   And in so doing, he started to mention that perhaps you guys are divided, and this is
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.240]   the case I made last time was, you guys are divided because underneath this, "Hey, I'm
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.480]   of Paulus, I'm of Paul, I'm of Jesus only," that kind of thing, underneath all this is
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.660]   worldly thinking.
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.740]   Underneath all this is worldly wisdom.
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.640]   So he desires to attack and challenge their worldview, their scheme of how they value
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.200]   what they value.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.200]   Okay?
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.200]   So in review of last time, the very first, I guess, section that I want to read is verse
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.360]   19 and 20.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.320]   So after he says this, "For it is written, 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.920]   the cleverness of the clever I will set aside.'
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.320]   Where is the wise man?
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.320]   Where is the scribe?
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.600]   Where is the debater of this age?
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.600]   Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?"
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.480]   And I made the first point, which is, the wisdom of God is permanent.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   Right?
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.960]   From that verse, you recognize he's saying, "Where are all these wise people?
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.080]   They're gone, they're dead.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.800]   All the ancient philosophers, guess what?
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.660]   They're in the grave."
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.900]   But God's wisdom is permanent.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.340]   And so that's why God's wisdom is superior.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.480]   Number two, in the next section, I'm not going to read it for us, but Apostle Paul says,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.960]   "God's wisdom is powerful."
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.240]   As a matter of fact, I used the adjective limitless.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.520]   Right?
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.240]   It's powerful without limit.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.440]   And the flip side of that is, those who are of worldly philosophy, those who are of worldly
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.640]   wisdom, they are powerless to save.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.560]   They are powerless to have knowledge of God.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.920]   They are powerless in the wisdom that they offer.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.860]   Because their wisdom truly, it's contradictory.
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.780]   Their wisdom is passing by fads.
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.360]   Their wisdom is sometimes disconnected all of its own.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.320]   And so he says, "The cross, the gospel of Jesus, overcomes all human wisdom."
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   Now, the train of thought that I wanted to rehearse with you in going through this was
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.480]   simply that train of thought.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.520]   These people are fighting.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.280]   They're fighting obviously because they're trying to one up each other in pride.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.960]   "Oh, you're of a Paulist?
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.840]   Well, I learned under Paul.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.120]   And Paul taught a Paulist, so there."
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.560]   "Oh, you're of Paul?
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.680]   Well, I'm just Jesus only, so there."
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.320]   They're trying to one up each other with their pride and arrogance, and that always causes
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.320]   division.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.320]   Right?
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.960]   And in so thinking, Paul presents the gospel and says, "You need to be gospel-minded.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:59.880]   You need to be having the worldview that God wants you to have in addressing this situation."
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.960]   But in so doing, the connection between the previous verses that we're reading and then
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.840]   the connection between the passage that we just read and you guys talked about is this.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:18.720]   Apostle Paul uses the church as an example of God's wisdom, and he uses the example of
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.360]   God's calling, God's salvation calling of them.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.280]   So let's read it again, because I always benefit in reading something multiple times.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.400]   In verse 26 through 31, it says, "For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.120]   many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, but God has chosen
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.560]   the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.560]   the world to shame the things which are strong, and the base things of the world, and the
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.400]   despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that he may nullify the things that
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.960]   are, so that no man may boast before God, but by his doing you are in Christ Jesus,
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.720]   who became to us wisdom from God and righteousness, sanctification and redemption, so that just
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.440]   as it is written, 'Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.'"
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.400]   Okay.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.000]   So as we begin this section, I would like for us to start jotting down some of the things
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.760]   that we observe.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.720]   He calls the church to consider their calling, and really if you think about their calling,
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.320]   it's their calling as his general salvation, the call of God, you know?
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.600]   And as he asks them to think about it, he doesn't necessarily ask them just to think
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.960]   about the calling itself, he's gonna ask them to think about that a little later.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.620]   He asks them to think about themselves, when they were called, their personal circumstance.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.360]   So let's jot that in.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.560]   So letter A is just consider yourself when you were called, and this is also for us in
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.200]   our Bible study, consider yourself when you were called, right?
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.840]   Letter B, what's the first description that you see?
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.560]   What's the first description of them?
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.080]   Consider yourself when you were called.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.000]   The first thing I noticed was, not wise.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.840]   Sorry, I laughed 'cause I heard, "Stupid, stupid."
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.160]   Not wise, okay?
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.880]   That they were not wise, and he is talking about actual education.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.400]   Education was not like today where, yeah, if you wanna get a job, you get educated,
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.480]   so everybody who wants a job is gonna get educated.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.640]   No, that's not the way it worked back then.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.680]   Education was for the privileged, you know?
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.680]   To have a mentor, to have a disciple, to have a educator above you, that must have meant
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.040]   you were already rich.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.520]   What's the second thing?
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   Powerful?
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.000]   Is that what it said?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Yeah, not powerful, okay?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.800]   Some translations say, "You're not mighty."
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.680]   You're not mighty, you're not powerful.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.760]   And that's really talking about the idea of influential, like you have no sway on people.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.760]   You have no power in the sense that you have no control over anybody.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.800]   What's the next thing that you see?
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.680]   You're not noble, okay?
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.120]   Noble.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.960]   And that one, he's talking about birth order, actually.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.120]   There is a sense in which, obviously, in our day and age, here and now, we don't have this
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:34.060]   kind of culture, but if you've seen any of the TV shows or movies from the past, a vast
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.340]   majority of history functioned where you were born into a certain class.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.100]   As a matter of fact, if you're Korean, and you know of the Korean culture, even back
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:49.740]   50 years ago, there were the noblemen and then there were your peasant people.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.260]   And those two never crossed.
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.220]   Their kids didn't play with each other.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.660]   They dressed differently.
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.700]   They could never cross this barrier, right?
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.740]   A bunch of history was like that.
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.820]   And so, Paul's looking at them, saying, "So, how many of you guys are like, noblemen?"
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.860]   I don't see very many.
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.900]   There were some people who were higher class, so to speak, or more powerful.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.380]   Remember, I talked about there was a gentleman who got saved earlier on, Stephanus?
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.700]   He's the one who was kind of leader of the synagogue in Corinth, okay?
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.660]   So there were people who were reputable, people who were powerful, but the vast majority,
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.460]   he says, "You guys really weren't that impressive."
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:33.220]   Now, I ask this question, "Would you have been offended by this?"
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:38.700]   And the reason why I ask this question is because, did you notice how earlier, he was
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.700]   talking about doctrinally, how important the gospel is?
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:53.180]   But as soon as we begin this section, what changes?
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.420]   He's not talking about the unimpressedness of the gospel.
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:01.620]   He's talking about the unimpressedness of the people.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.860]   So what you find is, he's getting personal.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:11.860]   What you find is, he's actually having them think about themselves in light of the gospel,
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:19.060]   but more specifically, when God called them, when God drew them, what was their condition?
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:26.300]   If they are, as we began, in this battle to see who can outdo one another in honor, reputation,
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.140]   respect, if they can outdo each other in kind of the accolades, or even just the name dropping
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.580]   of the association that they have, he's getting a bit personal and says, "Look at you.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.100]   Look at you, real good for a moment."
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.100]   Right?
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:45.380]   And Apostle Paul does that, and there's a sense in which, I guess, if you were reading
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.980]   this, you could potentially get really offended.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.980]   It's like, "What the?
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:55.660]   Just call me, like he's a stupid, you know, weak, and just all around unimpressive."
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.380]   And I want, you know, we have to think about that for a little bit, because there's a sense
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:05.820]   in which, let's say some of us in here are not that, as in, you're really smart, and
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.860]   you have a lot of power because maybe you're like a higher up in your company, and you
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.180]   have a lot of possessions, and people just find you quite noble and respectable, and
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.780]   everybody kind of lifts you up.
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:24.620]   The fact of the matter is, as a Christian, you either recognize that you're in that position
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:32.140]   before, or you know very well that as a Christian, as you're adopted into Christ's household,
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.980]   that's how you're going to look to the rest of the world.
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:41.100]   So it's not just the doctrines that are unimpressive to the world, it's the people, right?
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.740]   And that's something we have to recognize.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:49.700]   Moving forward, though, in the next section, he gives a contrast, and he says, "So you
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:55.180]   guys think you are like this, because you guys obviously are trying to fight for positions,
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:00.860]   or fight for reputation, but the fact of the matter is," he says in verse 27, "that God
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.540]   has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.780]   weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong, and the base things of the
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:14.980]   world, and the despised God has chosen the things that are not, so that he may nullify
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.780]   the things that are, so that no man may boast before God."
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.780]   Okay?
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:27.220]   What I'd like you guys to do for a moment is, there on your papers, please try to underline
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.700]   as many purpose statements that you can find.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.540]   I count four, or actually I wrote it in there, sorry.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:38.220]   Please underline the four purpose statements in verses 27 through 29.
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.020]   And if you're done with that, please circle the descriptions of the kinds of people he
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.020]   has chosen.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.020]   Okay?
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:51.020]   Take time to do that for a moment.
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.020]   Yes?
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:02.580]   Okay, great.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:08.140]   So purpose statement, purpose statement is stuff when you see like, "so that," "in
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.260]   order to," sometimes they leave out the "in order" and you find just the preposition
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.820]   "to" do something, right?
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.620]   So you find, "this is what he did," and you ask why, and he reveals to you what he
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.940]   was aiming at, and there you have your purpose statement.
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.300]   Okay?
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:36.260]   And there's a specific reason why I ask first why, before having you identify what.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.260]   Okay?
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.260]   Okay.
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:13:02.260]   All right.
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:18.260]   Okay, so table to my left with Isaac, John, and John.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:25.420]   First purpose statement is, "to shame the wise."
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.500]   This table here with Andy and...
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:38.500]   Second one is, "shame the strong," right in front of me with Chris and Andy.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:45.220]   The third one is, "to nullify the things that are," and the third one, this table
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.780]   here with Dr. Mobley and Dr. Payne.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.060]   Great, so that no one would boast.
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.060]   Okay?
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:14:00.500]   So you see what he's doing, and sometimes stuff like this really is kind of surprising
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.860]   to me, I guess, because you know, we typically have a notion of God as like, he's always
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:10.420]   wanting to relent, which is true, but then you realize he's doing things, this is the
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:15.300]   way he functions, like this is the way he operates as God.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:21.340]   He is shaming people, he is nullifying the things that are, and he's making sure people
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.460]   never boast.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:28.460]   And remember, at the very beginning of this study, I said, I found it really kind of shocking
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:33.940]   and a bit like, again, enlightening, when God said from the Old Testament, ever since
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:39.900]   then, that he is not only going to, you know, not regard the wisdom of man, but what was
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.180]   he going to do to it?
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.700]   Destroy it.
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.780]   Okay?
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:53.980]   And so, one can legitimately ask the question, why would God go to this extent to shame people?
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.380]   To nullify them?
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.100]   And just put them down so that they never, like, you know, is God that kind of fearful
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.340]   God where he's like, don't you dare toot your little horn in front of me, and he gets all
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.340]   angry and he's like, bam, and he always squashes people?
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:10.020]   I mean, is that the kind of picture of God we want to have because of these verses?
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.180]   No.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.700]   So what is he doing?
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:21.900]   Well, we noticed, as you guys circle, we noticed the people of the world who thought
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.740]   they were first what?
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.140]   Wise, and then strong.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.020]   They thought they were, that they're something.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.100]   And scripture even says it in the almost verbatim, stop thinking you're something when you're
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.620]   really nothing.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.460]   And then those people who boast.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:47.460]   And what I find really interesting about the way God operates is he always gives just desserts.
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.260]   So I ask this question, what is he doing?
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:56.060]   And letter B, I write, the principle of God on how he works, he gives just desserts.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:01.260]   And this is something that I've noticed from Genesis.
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.340]   You know?
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.460]   This is something that I noticed through the kings, something I noticed through even the
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:11.460]   New Testament, and something that I noticed even in the end times.
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.340]   Right now it's kind of interesting because I've been studying Genesis and Revelation
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.440]   at the same time and I see this principle working.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.660]   God is not a God who irrationally reacts to stuff.
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:28.420]   Sometimes for us, we go overboard, somebody does something like make fun of a body part
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:33.100]   on you, people tend to make fun of my hands a lot, and then you overreact.
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.500]   "What'd you say?"
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.180]   Never talking to you again, all that kind of stuff.
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.860]   Well God is not a God who just overreacts because he's temperamental.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.500]   God is not a God who says, "Oh no, no, no, don't you dare be proud in front of me," and
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.060]   just squashes it because he's that kind of angry God.
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.060]   God is a God who always gives just desserts.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:17:00.700]   For example, a lot of the punishment that God gives to people matches their sin.
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.060]   Okay?
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.060]   Matches their sin.
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.900]   I'm going to give some examples.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.180]   From the very beginning, Eve.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:14.300]   You know, Eve, it says that God said that Eve is going to have this desire for her husband
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.100]   as to overtake him.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:20.740]   But then the punishment that he gave Eve right after he says that is what?
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.540]   But your husband is going to?
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.540]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.260]   He's going to be over you.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:31.900]   And even to the man, there's a sense in which both man and woman together, and mankind,
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.900]   wanted to what?
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.900]   Elevate.
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.180]   They wanted to know what God knew.
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:39.060]   They wanted to be more than they were.
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.060]   What does God say?
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:44.260]   "Let me remind you, you're going back to the dust."
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.460]   There's this kind of just desserts that happens throughout scripture all the time.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:53.460]   When people are prideful and they want to boast about all they've done, what does God
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.740]   do then?
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.380]   This passion says he's going to shame them.
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.900]   There are people who think, "I am more than what I really am."
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.620]   They try to make much of who they are.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.620]   Guess what he says?
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.620]   "I'm going to nullify you."
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.500]   Nullify in the Greek literally means to make nothing.
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.140]   To make nothing.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.380]   So the way that that part in the Greek reads is like those that are something are going
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.540]   to become nothing.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:22.340]   And so what happens is God is a God who functions in this way where he always gives just desserts.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:26.180]   And to the proud, what does he say?
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.180]   He says, "I'm going to shame and bring you down to nothing."
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:35.380]   So for this, I feel like there's a point for us to take home.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.300]   There's something for us to learn.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.380]   I guess a motivation to fight our pride.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:48.860]   Because we realize truly if we are tempted to go toot our horn, if we are tempted more
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.180]   practically and more relevantly to this passage, to compare ourselves with other people in
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.500]   our church and start playing this comparison game.
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.220]   By playing this, I can outdo you game.
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.620]   Where if you name drop, then I'm going to name drop.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.220]   If you talk about how much Bible you know, then I'm going to talk about how much Bible
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.820]   I know.
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.820]   Or whatever it may be in the church that we sometimes struggle with.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.580]   Realize that the way God operates is he is going to do the opposite of what you're trying
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.580]   to accomplish.
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.180]   Here you are trying to accomplish a name and reputation for yourself.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.420]   He is going to humiliate you.
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.020]   That's oftentimes how God operates.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:31.580]   Still you realize, I mean, when it comes to the issue of pride in our hearts, we truly
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.340]   have to recognize God.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:40.700]   I put that application, we recognize that God operates in this way which challenges
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.540]   and motivates us to tackle our pride.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.500]   But also we recognize our own hearts.
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:51.980]   This is where I would like to have you guys just do one of those self-evaluating moments.
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:59.700]   Are there ways in me where I wish I was something more, when as a matter of fact, God is blessing
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.460]   where I'm already at?
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.180]   What I mean by that is, there are many times when I think I wish I was more.
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.580]   I think and I daydream and I fantasize that I wish I was more.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.660]   I've shared this with you guys multiple times, so this is an old example.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.140]   I so wish that I could read faster.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.740]   I was so jealous of Pastor Aaron.
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.540]   Pastor Aaron came over to my house one time and we were reading together.
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:26.420]   He finished a small book about this size, this typical reading book like that in about
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.420]   an hour and a half.
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.420]   I went, "What the heck?"
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:33.260]   I was still on chapter one, page 15.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.620]   He leaned over and he was kind of like, he didn't say anything.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.380]   Then another time I was reading with James Hong and he noticed how slow I was reading
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.780]   and he was kind of like, "You got to move on, brother.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.900]   You just have to keep going, man."
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.740]   I actually took a reading class where I learned how to use a pen, like a marker thing, and
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:57.580]   then go underneath the lines and how to maximize your time by holding the page with your finger
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.500]   already by the time you get to the bottom of the page so you can quickly turn and move
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.220]   to the next page and stuff like that.
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.460]   I've been learning all this stuff, but there are a lot of times when I just sit there and
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.300]   say, "I wish I was smarter.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.300]   I wish I was smarter."
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:16.620]   The reason why I share that with you is because the problem isn't the smarts.
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:23.100]   Being smart, obviously, is not what God requires as a criteria for being a good follower of
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.220]   Christ.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.260]   And being dumb necessarily is not what he is saying that he is going to bless.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.780]   Yes, did he choose the things that are base?
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.820]   Yes, I'm going to make a point of that really quickly.
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:40.060]   But the fact of the matter is, whether really slow in reading or fast in reading or really,
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.380]   really intellectual or not, they're nothing.
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.780]   Neither contributes to godliness.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.380]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:52.740]   But the person who sits there thinking that is going to make him more than he is, there
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.740]   lies your problem.
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:59.380]   The person who sits there making much of smarts because he thinks that's his answer, there
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.660]   is a problem, right?
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:08.340]   The person who thinks, "I wish I was a little taller, baller," all that stuff, the person
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.180]   who's making a lot of that, that's the problem.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:20.220]   God is not saying, "Try to be dumb, ignoble, and all that, then I'm going to bless you."
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.660]   God is saying, "The problem is you think those things are the criteria that make you better
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.860]   than the other people in your church."
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.300]   So he rebukes that kind of attitude.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:34.740]   And so for us, we're just reminded of this fact.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.940]   Ephesians chapter two, we don't have to turn there, but I want to ask you a question.
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:46.020]   What kind of people did he choose according to Ephesians chapter two?
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:54.620]   For you were once?
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.340]   In chapter two later he says you were foreigners, you were strangers, completely like exiled
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.540]   from God, far and distant.
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.540]   Dead.
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.540]   Yeah.
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.540]   Dead.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.540]   Okay?
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.340]   So even if you think, "Oh, I'm low," you're not thinking low enough.
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.420]   We have to recognize that.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:18.180]   There's a sense in which the people of the time had to empty themselves of their own
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:24.100]   wisdom and self-worth in order to truly gain the wisdom of God and the worth that God was
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.100]   going to give them.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.580]   There had to be a renouncing of their own wisdom, their own accolade and smarts and
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.580]   so forth.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:37.020]   And so the passage I have there, this Jeremiah one is really cool and I think we should,
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.460]   if you guys can devote to memorizing that one, that's a good one.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:46.860]   Jeremiah chapter nine verse 24, "But let him who boasts, boast of this, that he understands
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.700]   and knows me, that I am the Lord who exercises loving kindness, justice and righteousness
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:57.300]   on earth, for I delight in these things, declares the Lord."
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:02.180]   And right before this in Jeremiah he says, "Let not the mighty man boast in his might.
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.540]   Let not the rich man boast in his riches."
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.140]   Really powerful passage, okay?
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.380]   Let's take a look at verse 30.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:15.940]   So he says, this is the way God operates.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:22.220]   And he says, "The way God is operating is giving just desserts, but know that God has
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.460]   designed it so no one is going to boast before God.
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:30.260]   No one is going to blow his horn in front of God.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.620]   Every single instrument is going to be for the worship of God.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.540]   In the presence of the Lord, no man is going to have pride."
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.540]   Okay?
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.700]   And then in verse 30, there's a contrast.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:45.180]   "But," okay, so there's a huge contrast here with this word, "but."
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:53.180]   "By his doing, you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God and righteousness
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.180]   and sanctification and redemption."
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.180]   Okay.
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.420]   I have a question for you, interpretive question.
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:04.340]   And it's because it kind of reads funny.
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:12.340]   Are you the subject that is in righteousness, sanctification, and redemption?
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:19.620]   Or she would read this more like, "By his doing, you are in Jesus Christ, who became,"
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.780]   and then list the rest.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.140]   Wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption.
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.980]   And the follow-up question is, does it matter however you translate the two?
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:29.980]   Think about it.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.860]   If you guys have different versions, try to read it.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.980]   If you guys, I think most of you, how many of you guys have NASB?
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.980]   Okay a couple of you guys.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.980]   How many of you guys have ESV?
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.900]   Probably the majority of you.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:41.900]   Okay?
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:42.900]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.860]   They actually read pretty different, each translation.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.420]   So read it a little bit and try to figure that out for a moment.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.180]   You guys get my question, right?
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:55.540]   Who is the subject of those descriptions, righteousness, or those nouns, righteousness,
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:56.900]   sanctification, redemption?
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.780]   And I think in ESV it says righteousness, holiness, and redemption.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:14.940]   So are you in those things, or have Jesus become those things?
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:38.780]   I'm not sure.

[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.620]   This is good. What are some of the things that you guys kind of concluded to?
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:58.620]   Again, to tell you honestly, there's like not only those two views, but there's three more views.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:02.620]   But I didn't want to confuse you guys with the three more.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.620]   OK, over here with Eric.
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.620]   [ERIC] Well, after you skipped the ESL, I could be wrong.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.620]   You always preface that like...
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:16.620]   [ERIC] But the comma who refers to what's before, so that's Jesus.
