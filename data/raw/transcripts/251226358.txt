[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   You probably will agree with me, if Revelation was confusing, Leviticus is going to be much
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.640]   more confusing.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.360]   But part of the reason why I wanted to tackle Leviticus, there's several reasons.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:24.040]   One is I think it's important for us to have some working knowledge of every part of Scripture.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.080]   There's no part of Scripture that God wrote where it says, "We can understand God if we
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.860]   don't really need to have this book."
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.160]   Every part of it has something that God has placed where it's essential for our understanding
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.040]   of who He is and what He is doing.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.600]   So whether you fully understand it or you get just a glimpse of understanding of what
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.840]   it means, it's important that at least we have some working knowledge of His intent
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.000]   in the book of Leviticus.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.400]   Leviticus is one of those books that if you do not commit to it, I can already tell you,
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.960]   if Revelation went over your head, and I know that some of it did, I hope you were able
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.160]   to catch a lot of it, but if Revelation went over your head, Leviticus is going to sound
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.240]   nothing more than studying legal document about something that you have no interest
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.600]   in ever applying.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.800]   It's no different than if I just gave you a law book and just say, "Read it."
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.200]   And you just have to, just out of duty, you just have to read one chapter this week, next
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.680]   chapter next week.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.080]   So I really encourage you to engage.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.720]   Even if you can't study it diligently, at least read what the content is and at least
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.520]   know what the questions are, right?
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.280]   Even if you don't know the answers, at least know what the questions are in the text that
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.280]   we're looking at.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.720]   Say, "I don't understand it.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.160]   Why did the bulls need to be given?
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.960]   Why is it unclean to do this or to do that?"
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.000]   At least if you know those questions, when we deal with it, you'll know what we're talking
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.160]   about instead of just it going over your head.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.840]   So again, just want to really encourage you to commit to the study.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:13.080]   And I can personally say that of all the books that I've studied personally, Leviticus, again,
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.520]   was one of the books that I've probably benefited from the most.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.940]   Partially it's because I knew so little about it before I studied it.
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.160]   And then when I did study it, I realized just how crucial it was to my understanding of
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.900]   all the rest of Scripture.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.160]   So I guarantee you, if you didn't know the content of Leviticus and you studied and committed
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.320]   with us from now until we finished the book of Leviticus, I guarantee you, you're going
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.960]   to come out of it thinking, "Wow, I really did not fully grasp the gospel until I came,"
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.080]   or at least you had a very superficial understanding of it until you began to understand the content
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.440]   of Leviticus, okay?
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.960]   So I can't emphasize enough how important this book is.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.640]   In fact, in the Jewish synagogue, the very first book that was taught any child was the
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.240]   book of Leviticus.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.940]   So again, it was that important to them.
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.880]   So today, for the New Testament church, we typically say, "What book should we study?"
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.400]   If you're a brand new Christian, probably the Gospel of John is the first one that somebody
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.480]   would recommend.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.520]   If you want to really dive in and really understand the gospel, we would recommend the book of
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.360]   Romans to really go and dissect that.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.640]   And if you understand the book of Romans, you'll say you understand what God has been
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.640]   doing.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.080]   In the Old Testament, if you were to pick a book to understand God and what He is doing,
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.360]   it would be Leviticus.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.520]   So many commentators will call Leviticus the Romans of the Old Testament, okay?
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.160]   So considering how important it is to have very little knowledge of its significance
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.400]   and its meaning, again, it means that there's a big gaping hole of our understanding of
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.240]   God and what He's doing in the Old Testament.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.520]   Again, so I can't emphasize enough how important this is.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.200]   Just as some logistics, just to kind of give you a heads up, obviously I'm headed out to
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.800]   India this Friday, so I won't be here next Wednesday, but Pastor Mark will be here teaching.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.120]   He won't be teaching specifically in a text, but just covering over the subject of holiness.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.080]   And so the Bible study will continue.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.040]   So we will not have a break next week, so Pastor Mark is going to cover for me until
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.360]   I come back.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.920]   And when I do come back, we'll jump into the text chapter one, two, and three.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.800]   And so the homework will be given to you at the end of the session, okay?
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.360]   Another thing is after my teaching, a quick overview of the book of Leviticus, we're going
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.380]   to break you guys into small groups.
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.720]   So Pastor Mark has assignments, the group assignments, and he's going to post it up
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.720]   here.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.360]   So that way the small group leaders know who's in their group.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.880]   And so we're going to have you guys look for your small group.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.920]   So it's going to take a little bit of time, but we want to get the chaos over with today.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.280]   And if your name is not up there afterwards, please go see Pastor Mark and then he'll assign
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.960]   you to a group, okay?
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.000]   I'm going to repeat this again at the end so that you'll know this.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.040]   And then another announcement is in our schedule, one of the things that we wanted to address
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.440]   in the coming year is we want to address corporate prayer and worship.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.120]   We used to do this a while back, but for whatever the reason, we stopped doing that.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.760]   But once a month, about once a month, instead of our normal Wednesday Bible study, weekday
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.280]   Bible study, we're having praise and prayer.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.400]   So the whole church, this is our group, the college group, and the youth group, once a
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.600]   month on Friday, it's going to be about once a month.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.360]   The whole church is going to come together and we're going to take time in extended prayer.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.440]   And so prayer is one of the things that we've identified and discussed in evaluating where
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   we are as a church.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.240]   We really want it to be devoted to corporate prayer.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.600]   Once a month is not enough, right?
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.740]   But at least we want to start there.
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.600]   So just to give you a heads up, so those are things that are a little bit different for
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.800]   this session.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.780]   So normal Bible study, but once a month we're having praise and prayer.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.360]   So we'll be giving you a heads up when those times come, okay?
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.000]   Let me pray for us and we'll jump right in.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.400]   Gracious Father, we pray for wisdom and your Holy Spirit's direction as we study this book.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.280]   There's so much in here that is so significant and yet so much of it, Lord God, escapes us.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.160]   I pray, Father, that you would give us wisdom and insight, not simply to understand, but
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.600]   to be convicted that as we gain insight into your work in your heart, that we may know
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.480]   who you are in a deeper way and how we ought to respond to that, Lord God, in a way that
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.480]   honors you.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.160]   I pray that you would bless the time that we have, again, that it would be more than
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:45.200]   just simply academic knowledge, but that you would move us, sanctify us, rebuke us, encourage
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.400]   and strengthen us, Lord God, that we may be better worshipers of you.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.600]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.280]   All right, so as you can see, the picture is a picture of the tabernacle.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.680]   Let me just...
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.800]   So this introduction to the book of Leviticus, the study of Leviticus is vital to understanding
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.920]   the full gospel message.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.600]   So we've been going through the book of Romans and obviously we're going to detailed message
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.580]   of redemption, propitiation, adoption, and all these things in the book of Romans.
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.360]   But the foundation in understanding the gospel really is you have to understand the book
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.120]   of Leviticus because so much of the language of the gospel comes from this book.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:38.560]   The idea of atonement, redemption, sanctification, holiness, wrath, clean, unclean, all of these
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.480]   ideas that are embedded in the gospel message, the foundation comes from the book of Leviticus.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.320]   So you probably heard of many of these terms or you know it because you've heard it so
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.760]   many times, but Leviticus will give you the context in which these ideas of atonement
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.760]   comes from.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.040]   Okay, so again, I can't emphasize enough how important this book is.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.680]   Second Timothy 3, 16, 17, as you guys know, it says, "All scripture is breathed out by
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.440]   God and profferable teaching, reproof, correction, training, and righteousness, that the man
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.920]   of God may be competent and equipped for every good work."
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.520]   So when Second Timothy 3, 16 is referring to all scripture, is it talking about the
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.760]   New Testament or the Old Testament?
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.520]   The New Testament hasn't been put together yet.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.680]   It's in the context of writing the New Testament.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:30.240]   So when Paul says, "All scripture is God-breathed and is profitable," the only collected text
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.840]   that he had was the Old Testament.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.400]   So our study of the Old Testament is vital.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.000]   All of it is profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, training, and righteousness.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.320]   So to a New Testament Christian, to be so ignorant about the Old Testament means that
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.880]   there's a huge chunk of our Christian life that we don't fully grasp.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.440]   And I think partially the reason why there's superficial application of our Christian lives
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.320]   is because we only have a partial understanding of our faith, partial understanding of the
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.320]   gospel.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.320]   Okay?
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:09.760]   The book of Leviticus is quoted in the New Testament over a hundred times.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:16.600]   Again, just to clarify how important this book is to the New Testament writers and understanding
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.600]   of the gospel.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.920]   Because so much of the content of what Christ has done on the cross and the meaning of the
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   kingdom and all these things come from this book.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:33.040]   Leviticus is a shadow of the gospel that is ultimately fulfilled in Christ.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.640]   See that in Colossians 2, 16 and 17?
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.400]   "Therefore, let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink or with regard
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:46.160]   to festival, new moon, or Sabbath, which is all taught in Leviticus.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.340]   These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ."
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.520]   So what we're studying in Leviticus is a shadow of the gospel.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.520]   This is basically a pre-gospel.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:03.720]   Again, in Hebrews 8, 3 to 5, "For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.120]   Thus it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.560]   Now, if we were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.480]   offer gifts according to the law.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.040]   They serve a copy in shadow of the heavenly things.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.680]   For when Moses was about to erect a tent, he was instructed by God, saying, 'See that
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.680]   you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.'"
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.960]   So again, in Hebrews it says what they are practicing here is a pattern of the reality
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.480]   in heaven, ultimately in Christ.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.740]   So what we are studying is a shadow of the gospel.
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:42.040]   So Leviticus, the study of Leviticus is a challenge because it's mostly about the law.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.520]   And it's an instruction manual for something we will never build, so unless we understand
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.200]   what it points to, we won't profit from the study.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.000]   So let me make that absolutely crystal clear.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   If you don't understand, the way that we are going to study the book of Leviticus ultimately
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.760]   is we're going to, just like we do any other interpretation, what did it mean?
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.720]   How did the recipients of the letter receive this?
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.320]   Before we spiritualize and point to anything else, we want to understand in the historical
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.360]   context that it was written.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.760]   But our ultimate goal is not simply understand how they understood it, but what does it point
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.160]   to?
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.520]   Because it is a book of rules and regulations, for the most part, 95% of the writing in the
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.120]   book of Leviticus are rules and regulations.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.120]   What kind of sacrifices to give, how you ought to give it, what is considered clean and unclean.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.960]   And so if you read it without understanding what it points to, it'll just sound like an
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:45.300]   instruction manual to build a building that you have no intention of ever building.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.440]   So it's going to tell you how to give sacrifices when you will never make give these sacrifices.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.640]   You're never going to offer up a bull.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.080]   You're never going to sacrifice a pigeon or a bird.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.400]   You're never going to practice these things.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:03.040]   So if you don't understand what it points to, then the study of it is not going to be
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.040]   profitable.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.440]   So just to kind of give you a heads up, that's going to be the context in how we're approaching
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:14.200]   this that ultimately, what do these things, like how are these a shadow of the reality
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.960]   that we find in Christ?
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.960]   What does it point to?
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.160]   And that's what we're going to be looking for as we are studying.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:27.400]   John Stott, in Study of the Leviticus, he says, "Reading Leviticus is like rummaging
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.680]   through an old chest in the attic.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.760]   Though confronted with many strange items from bygone era, the photos you encounter
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.360]   present faces of ancestors with striking resemblance to your own.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.760]   Likewise, the rituals of Leviticus are unfamiliar relics of bygone era.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.760]   But in them, we discern the early outlines of the same gospel we cherish as Christians."
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:53.000]   So I wanted you to read that because I thought he really grasped the spirit of the study
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.520]   of the Book of Leviticus, where the way he describes it is, it's just kind of going
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.280]   to the attic and finding old pictures.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.640]   It's not pictures of you, but it's pictures of maybe your great-great-grandfather, and
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.400]   you begin to see the traces of, "Hey, maybe my son looks like that grandfather."
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.040]   And you could see the lineage, even though it was many, many years ago.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.680]   And so that's exactly what you will find in the Book of Leviticus.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.880]   So many things that you already understand about the gospel, about blood atonement, about
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:27.680]   sacrifice, about redemption, all of these things, these ideas that you already know,
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.140]   and you're going to see where these ideas and these vocabularies came from in the Book
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.460]   of Leviticus.
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.280]   So it's not going to be as clear to you as the Book of Romans, but it's going to
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.560]   be, again, it's going to be like looking at ancestors' pictures.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:44.600]   And so I thought John's thought really captured that well.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.260]   What is the benefit of studying the shadow before seeing the reality?
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.520]   Why does God give us the gospel in the form of a shadow to begin with?
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.520]   I listed a couple.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.840]   One, it builds anticipation.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.200]   Years ago, there used to be a game show where a famous person would stand behind the screen,
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.480]   and then you would see their shadow.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.280]   And the whole game was trying to guess who they are, and then they'll give you hints.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.320]   And the point of this game, again, was to, again, identify the reality.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:21.540]   And so studying the shadow builds anticipation for the reality, right?
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:30.060]   So God gave what he was going to do in Christ in a shadow form so that when Christ came,
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.680]   if you were paying very close attention to the shadow, you would have recognized him,
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.680]   right?
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.160]   That only Christ's nose would fit that, only Christ's hair and his arms and his
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.800]   height and all of this.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.680]   But if you weren't paying attention, and you know nothing about the shadow, then you
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.500]   probably would not have recognized him, right?
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.840]   So the point of why he gave us preparation for the coming of Christ in the form of shadow,
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.640]   again, was to build anticipation.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.760]   And then it brings clarity, right?
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.480]   Certain things that you were looking at intently, the height, maybe the measurements and all
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.720]   this stuff, and then when Christ comes, it becomes much more real.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.680]   So it's kind of like if you were watching black and white TV and then you had color,
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.680]   right?
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.240]   I mean, the contrast is much bigger than that, but that would be a good way to understand
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.480]   where you saw something dimly lit, and all of a sudden they turn on the light and you
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.380]   say, "Ah, that's what it is," right?
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:28.940]   So when the light gets turned on, so that the picture will become even more clear because
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.040]   you paid attention to the shadow, okay?
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:40.200]   Thirdly, it keeps the reality a mystery until the right time to fully reveal it, right?
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.720]   So much of the prophecy that God gives, he gives it to us in bits and pieces, just like
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.360]   when we're studying the book of Revelation.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:53.600]   He doesn't say, "Jesus is going to come in 2035 on Tuesday at 6 p.m."
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.600]   He doesn't say that.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.800]   He gives us all of these imageries, right?
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.280]   So that if we paid very close attention, we don't know exactly when he's going to come,
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.840]   but if you've been studying and paying close attention, that you'll be able to recognize,
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.760]   "Ah, that's what he said," right?
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.920]   You'll be able to recognize, "Oh, there's the white horse," or, "There's the red horse."
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:18.000]   We don't know if it's going to be fulfilled literally, but he gave us glimpses of the
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.720]   end times so that when the reality comes, you'll be able to connect the dots, right?
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.400]   But until then, he keeps it a mystery, right?
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:32.000]   Mystery, not that he's trying to hide it, but the fullness of time has not come for
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   that to be fulfilled.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.540]   So it says that Christ came when the fullness of time had come.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:43.480]   So the reason why the Old Testament saints studied about the atonement and coming of
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.600]   the Messiah was because the fullness of time had not yet come.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.600]   So if they studied and paid very close attention to it, they should not have been caught off
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.600]   guard.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.760]   That when Christ came, they should have been able to recognize and say, "Jesus fits the
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.280]   shadow that we've been looking at," right?
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.360]   And so that's what we're studying in the book of Leviticus.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:10.360]   We're studying the shadow of the reality we already know in Christ, right?
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.000]   Another illustration, I found this in commentary, says, "Studying Leviticus is like studying
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.140]   a marriage ceremony.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.140]   Marriage ceremonies are filled with rituals that point to the gospel message, and each
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:24.080]   ritual is followed to highlight the drama of redemption acted out through the ceremony.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.120]   Leviticus is following rituals that highlight the drama of redemption that points forward
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.040]   to the coming of Christ and his death and atonement."
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.960]   So all the ritual things that we will study in the book of Leviticus is kind of like a
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.160]   marriage ceremony.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.240]   Like some of you, some of you, a few of you who've been married and went through the ceremony,
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.480]   you know, we go through and we talk about like, "Why do you walk down the middle aisle?
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.080]   Why do you have the lighting of the candles?"
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.080]   Right?
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.840]   You know, "Why do you have, you know, one side sit on the other side?
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.360]   How come, like every part of the ceremony, there's meaning behind it, right?
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.440]   There's, especially for Christians."
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.520]   And all of that points to the marriage drama that we're going to see when Christ comes,
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.520]   right?
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.680]   It points to the marriage drama that the scripture prophesies about the future.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.460]   So every time somebody gets married, we play out this drama.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.000]   Sometimes people know, a lot of times people don't know the meaning.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.080]   They just do it because out of tradition.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.840]   But a lot of these traditions are the gospel message is embedded, looking forward to the
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.840]   coming of Christ.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:33.880]   So the rituals that we see in the book of Leviticus are dramas that basically is acting
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:39.400]   out the gospel message about redemption, about sacrifice, about judgment, that ultimately
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.360]   points to the fulfillment in Christ, right?
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:48.400]   So it's almost kind of like somebody, if you've never attended a traditional Christian-American
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.800]   wedding, you know, maybe you come from the jungle and you've never seen it, and you walk
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.920]   in, you sit there, and you're just, imagine what you would be thinking if you're sitting
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.680]   there watching this wedding ceremony.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.160]   "Oh, she's wearing all white with a veil.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.480]   And no one else dresses like that.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.480]   She's dressed like a princess.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.640]   I wonder what that is about, right?
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.920]   How come everybody's, how come she's coming down the aisle?
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.680]   What is the meaning of lighting of the candle?
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.680]   Why are they bowing?
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.680]   Why are they in the middle?
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.680]   Why is that guy talking in the middle?"
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.360]   So you can imagine coming and thinking not understanding the ceremony because you don't
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.480]   understand what it points to.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.480]   So it's kind of like that.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.420]   Leviticus, if you don't know what it points to, you're basically sitting and watching
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.160]   a foreign ceremony, and you're just doing it because they told you to do it, but you
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.140]   don't know the significance, right?
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:36.340]   So that's what our study is going to be, is trying to figure out the significance of these
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:42.320]   rituals that God embedded into the culture of the Jews that ultimately is like the Christian
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:49.360]   marriage ceremony that, again, is fulfilled in Christ.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.200]   Some background information.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:20:01.800]   Exodus concludes in Exodus chapter 40, 34 through 38, where the tabernacle is constructed,
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.200]   right?
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.920]   And the glory of God fills the tabernacle.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.600]   So let me just read that passage real quick.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.640]   Exodus chapter 40, 34 through 38.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.960]   And this is how the book of Exodus ends.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.880]   "Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle,
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:24.120]   and Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it, and
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.120]   the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.360]   Throughout all their journeys, whenever the cloud was taken up over the tabernacle, the
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.360]   people of Israel would set out.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.240]   But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out till the day that it was taken
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.240]   up.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.480]   For the cloud of the Lord was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, and in
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.440]   the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys."
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.160]   So the glory of the Lord comes upon the tabernacle, and that's how it ends.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:54.320]   So if you look at chapter 1, verse 1, "The Lord called Moses and spoke to him from the
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.800]   tent of meeting, saying, 'Speak to the people of Israel.'"
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:04.360]   So Moses is speaking to God, or God is speaking from the tent of meeting.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.720]   I want you to turn your Bibles to Numbers chapter 1.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:14.560]   I want to see if you can see the difference between Leviticus chapter 1 and Numbers chapter
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:20.560]   1.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.680]   The Numbers chapter 1, verse 1, "The Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:32.840]   the tent of meeting on the first day of the second month in the second year after they
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.880]   had come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 'Take a census.'"
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.740]   So okay, it's just verse 1.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:44.520]   Can somebody tell me that this difference between Leviticus chapter 1 and Numbers chapter
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:52.200]   1?
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:57.240]   Leviticus chapter 1, verse 1, Numbers chapter 1, verse 1.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.760]   What is the key difference?
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:08.400]   There's one particular word.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.720]   I mean, obviously, there's a lot of different words that are different, but there's a key
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:20.560]   word that is different in Leviticus and Numbers.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   Called and spoke.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:26.080]   Yes, there are many things that are different, but that's not what I'm looking for.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.680]   There's a key word.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.160]   Say it.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.800]   From and in.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.800]   From and in.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:45.440]   Okay, so if you look at Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:51.880]   Exodus, God is at a distance from Israel.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.440]   In fact, God says, "If I go with these people, I'm going to kill these people."
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.800]   So God stays at a distance.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.840]   Leviticus, he draws near.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.120]   He's in the tabernacle, and he's speaking from the tabernacle.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:10.880]   In Numbers, after he establishes how to come to God, and through these rituals and sacrifices
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:17.280]   and being pure and impure, after he establishes and tells them how an unholy people can be
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.720]   in the presence of a holy God, and then he begins to set out to go to the promised land.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.040]   And so Book of Numbers is the history of Israel getting ready and going to the promised land.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:37.480]   But the way he speaks to Israel in Numbers is he speaks in the tabernacle.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.480]   It was wild for me.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.680]   It doesn't look like it was wild for you, but it was wild for me.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.680]   So you see the progression of God's presence in the nation of Israel, right?
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.760]   Where before the tabernacle is established, God says, "If I go with these people, these
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.880]   people are going to die because I can't tolerate their sin."
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.360]   He establishes a way for Israel to come to him through the tabernacle, and before he
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:01.160]   establishes it, he's speaking from the temple to the people outside.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:07.240]   And then after he establishes it, and then they begin to live this out and atone for
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   their sin through these sacrifices, he's speaking to them in the tabernacle.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.720]   Oh, now you get it?
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   Okay.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.720]   A few more people.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   Okay.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.720]   Let it sink in.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.720]   Okay.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   So that's Leviticus.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:27.180]   Leviticus is the step, process that God is taking to dwell among sinful people.
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.960]   And that's what the Book of Leviticus is.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.480]   He's establishing who he is, he's establishing who they are, and then he's establishing
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:38.760]   a way for them to get to him.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.520]   Okay?
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.240]   Okay.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:53.280]   You can just fill in the blanks because we already went over that.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.320]   And the title of the Book of Leviticus is appropriate considering most of the content
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.280]   of the book is about the rules and regulations given to the Levitical order of worship.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.160]   And again, that's why they call it Leviticus.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:11.560]   It's instructions for the Levites to intercede on behalf of sinful people.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.560]   Okay.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.720]   So purpose and content.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.680]   Now that Israel has been freed to worship God and the tabernacle is established, Leviticus
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.680]   is a detailed instruction on how to go about worshiping God physically, morally, and spiritually.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:33.440]   Physically, morally, and spiritually.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.360]   Much of Leviticus is devoted to distinguishing between what is clean and unclean.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.640]   So God is going to determine what is clean and what is unclean.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.560]   Now when we get to start talking about what is clean and unclean, there are some things
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.680]   that you're going to understand and there are some things that you're not going to understand.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.400]   So he said if you have leprosy and you have boils and then it's running, you know, you're
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.880]   considered unclean.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.960]   Right?
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.840]   So there are some things that just logically from the knowledge that we have, we understand
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.480]   why that would be considered unclean.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.240]   And then there are some things that he's going to say we're not going to understand.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.240]   Right?
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.540]   Like the animals with split hooves or, you know, with certain type of birds.
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.800]   One type of bird is clean, the other type of bird is unclean.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.220]   Now we don't understand because it doesn't explain why.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:26.360]   But the standard of what is clean and unclean is established by God, not by us.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.720]   God tells them what he considers unclean.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.320]   And if he says it's unclean, it's unclean.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   Right?
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.400]   You don't come before God and say, "Well, I don't, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.400]   I'm going to bring him anyway."
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.400]   Right?
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.400]   I determine.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.720]   So ultimately God determines what is clean and unclean.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.760]   Leviticus tells us what he determines.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.960]   Okay?
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:49.000]   The ultimate goal of Leviticus is to reveal the extent of God's holiness and the need
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.440]   for perfect sacrifice to atone for our sins.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.200]   So as we mentioned, that we know God's holy, right?
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:01.980]   But this is a drama acting out his holiness through the sacrifices.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:09.200]   We know that we need atonement, but the scripture, the sacrifices are going to detail of what
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.200]   kind of atonement is needed for what kind of sins.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.600]   And so it'll give us insight into how God views sin.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.160]   And it gives us insight as to when we say holy, that we don't just picture in our own
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.640]   mind what we think holiness is.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.920]   God tells us what holiness is in this book.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.040]   Right?
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.000]   So these are things that we already know.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.180]   We already know he's holy.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.080]   We already know we need atonement.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.760]   But this is the drama that acts it out so that we have a clearer picture.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.500]   Right?
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.320]   So Leviticus is the foundation upon which all the explanation of the gospel in the New Testament
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.200]   covenant is ultimately built.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:54.520]   The word holiness is mentioned 93 separate times in the book of Leviticus.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:01.040]   Our English word for holy comes from an old English word, halig, which means to be whole
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.920]   or to be healthy.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.480]   But it is not complete.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:14.240]   Again, the only reason I put that up there is to establish that we can't determine what
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.400]   is holy.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   Right?
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.080]   Even our idea of holiness is something that we create.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:24.640]   We have to make sure that when we say holy, that it's coming from a biblical understanding,
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.560]   biblical teaching of what he says holiness is.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:35.840]   The book of Leviticus has five different categories of holiness that, again, we're going to just
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.840]   tackle one by one.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.240]   A holy God.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.760]   How does a holy God dwell among unholy people?
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.120]   To what extent is he holy?
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.440]   What is the consequence of not taking his holiness seriously?
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:57.200]   All of these things are going to be acted out and shown through these ceremonies.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.740]   A holy priesthood.
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.480]   Someone who comes to mediate.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.560]   How does God view them?
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:07.680]   So you'll notice one of the things that early on in the sacrifices that when a priest sins,
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:14.160]   that the sacrifice that God requires for the priest is much higher than somebody from regular
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.520]   congregation.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.040]   And we see that reflected in the New Testament, too.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.480]   That the higher calling of a leader, the consequences are greater.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:26.080]   And so that idea is embedded in the very beginning of Leviticus.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.040]   The holiness of the priesthood.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.120]   The sacredness.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.840]   God's calling for holiness of God's people.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.360]   There are different degrees of punishment, different degrees of sacrifices based upon
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.620]   where you stand before God.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:50.400]   But again, God calls all of his people to be holy because he is holy.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:56.740]   A holy land, meaning the nation of Israel, where they dwell, because God called his people
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:02.160]   to be holy, he declares the land in which they live to be holy.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:08.840]   And one of the reasons why Israel goes into captivity is because they did not obey God
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.000]   and give the land the Sabbath.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.200]   Remember that?
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.480]   They didn't give the land Sabbath for 70 years.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.600]   That's why they were taken out for 70 years, because for 70 years they neglected the Sabbath.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.560]   Or more than that.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.520]   Again, all of these ideas.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.000]   And ultimately, a need for a holy savior.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.160]   Sacrifice being the sacrifice, and over and over again, he'll emphasize that the offering
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.000]   has to be without defect.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.120]   That any animal given to God, whether it is a bird, whether it's a bull, whether it's
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:46.800]   a goat, or whether it's a sheep, over and over again, if there's any defect, it cannot
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.560]   be accepted as a sacrifice.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.720]   What does that ultimately point to?
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:57.520]   That the lamb that has come to be sacrificed had to be perfect without defect.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:03.880]   And so again, that idea, imagery, is embedded in the book of Leviticus.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.400]   Need for blood sacrifice.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.720]   The word cleansing is mentioned 71 times.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.480]   How God views sin.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:18.160]   Sometimes when we talk about sin, again, we had this discussion earlier when our small
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.120]   group leaders meeting, and a lot of times people determine what is sinful, not sinful,
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.480]   based upon how they feel about it.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:32.480]   It doesn't bother my conscience, and so sometimes we determine whether something is profitable
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:38.120]   or not profitable, or sinful or not sinful, based upon if it bothers my conscience.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:43.000]   You're going to see through the book of Leviticus that sin is not determined by your conscience.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.120]   Sin is determined by a holy God.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:50.560]   What he says is sinful, even if it doesn't bother your conscience at all.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:55.200]   So sometimes our conscience in and of itself is defective because of our sins.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.960]   And so God's view of sin.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:06.800]   And then ultimately, God's remedy for sin.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:15.320]   So all of these things are embedded into this book.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.260]   Two key verses.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.060]   The first one is Leviticus 11.45.
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:24.720]   So you'll notice that I don't have memory verses for you.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.480]   I know some of you guys are very disappointed.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:35.200]   I can send one to you personally if you want, but I don't have memory verses each week for
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.600]   this session.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:42.080]   But I do want to strongly encourage you to memorize these two verses, because these are
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.720]   the two key verses of Leviticus.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:50.040]   The one is Leviticus 11.45, and then a very similar wording is mentioned in 19.2.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.160]   "For I am the Lord who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.400]   You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy."
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:01.780]   So that phrase that is repeated in the New Testament comes from Leviticus.
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.800]   The second one is Leviticus 17.11.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.560]   "For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it for you on the altar to
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:13.980]   make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life."
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.560]   So those two verses I want to encourage you, since we don't have memory verses each week,
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.280]   try to memorize those two verses as key verses.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:32.760]   God's call to holiness and God's plan for holiness.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.720]   And then the outline of Leviticus.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.560]   This is something I really want to encourage you guys to know.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.560]   Because if you understand this outline, I think it will help you in your study.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.000]   And it's going to be a very broad outline.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.160]   This outline of the whole book is written in a chiastic form.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.960]   How many of you have ever heard that term before?
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.480]   Some of you guys.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:34:01.120]   So the chiastic form of writing, if you understand what it is, it will help you to understand
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:07.120]   the writer's logical sequence in which he's trying to make a point.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.720]   So typically, if you're writing a paper, at least in our generation, you would start with
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:16.920]   an introduction and you would have some kind of a thesis.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:21.880]   You know, the world's, you know, the, what do you call it?
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.800]   There's global warming is real, as an example, okay?
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.320]   Whether it's real or not.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:31.160]   But you would, hey, here's my point, here are my subpoints, here's my support, and here's
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.900]   my conclusion, right?
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.800]   That's typically how you would write it.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:39.120]   Sometimes that conclusion may be in the, the thesis may be in the bottom, but typically
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.320]   you would begin with, here's my point and here's what I'm going to say to support my
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.800]   point, right?
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:51.840]   In a chiastic form, the main point, main thrust of the message is in the middle of the book.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:57.080]   And let me just give you, so in chiasm, the first half of the text presents a series of
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.360]   topics which the second half repeats in reverse order.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.840]   I'm going to give you the outline, but I want you to understand what a chiastic form is,
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:04.840]   right?
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:09.240]   So the first half gives you point by point what the point is, and then those points are
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.980]   repeated in the second half of the book in reverse order.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:17.580]   So basically it would be ABC, CBA.
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.500]   That's kind of what a chiastic form is.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:23.220]   And then right in the middle of that would be the main point.
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:30.600]   So let's say it would be ABC and then X, CBA.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.960]   And X would be the main point.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.860]   That's a chiastic form.
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.220]   All right?
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:39.940]   You guys' brains fried from working too hard?
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.940]   Did you get that?
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:41.940]   Did you follow?
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:42.940]   All right?
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.460]   So Leviticus is written in a classic chiastic form.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.260]   So let me just give you, okay?
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:53.260]   Again, so the focal point of the text is in the middle.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:36:00.160]   And if you understand this, you'll have a broad outline in your head, okay, how Leviticus
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.300]   is written, right?
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.440]   And it's really not that complicated.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:12.540]   So the following chiasm points to the Day of Atonement as the focus of Leviticus, which
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.420]   comes out in chapter 16.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:19.260]   It's right in the middle of the book where there's a strict teaching about the Day of
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.260]   Atonement.
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:24.100]   Now, if you know anything about the Day of Atonement, I probably didn't have to tell
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.100]   you that.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:29.620]   Because you probably already know the significance of this Day of Atonement that I didn't have
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:35.140]   to tell you that the Day of Atonement is what all of this ultimately points to, that it
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.580]   is the key, right?
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.380]   Just because we know what that day is.
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:45.420]   But just following this chiastic form, even if you didn't know what the Day of Atonement
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:51.100]   was and you never read chapter 16, you would understand that whatever was written in chapter
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:54.460]   16 was probably the main point, which happens to be the Day of Atonement.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.780]   So let me give you a quick outline, okay?
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.160]   Here's the outline.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:08.980]   So if you notice, chapter 1, so chapter 1 through chapter 7 are the five major sacrifices,
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.260]   right?
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.940]   Anybody know the five major sacrifices?
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:20.940]   You have the burnt offering, grain offering, do I have it up there?
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:25.260]   Peace offering, sin offering, and guilt offering.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.020]   So you have the five major offerings.
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:32.620]   And so chapter 1 through 7 deals with the five major offerings and how to handle that.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.480]   So chapter 1 through 7.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.940]   Chapter 8 through 10 lays out the priesthood.
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.940]   What are their requirements?
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.940]   How are they to be cleansed?
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.900]   How are they to enter the temple?
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.460]   How are they to be prepared and to be established?
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:49.640]   Chapter 11 through 15, he begins to go through what is clean and unclean, what God views
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.860]   as clean and what God views as unclean.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.740]   And then we get to chapter 16, the Day of Atonement, right?
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:01.660]   And so when you get to chapter 17, in the reverse order, chapter 17 to 20, what is considered
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:02.660]   clean and unclean?
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:06.500]   So it's not the exact same content, but the theme is the same.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.700]   So you'll read, when you get to chapter 17, you're not going to see the exact same thing
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.260]   repeated.
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:17.220]   But if you were to title it, the title would be very similar to what you see under point
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.900]   three.
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.740]   It's basically laws about what God considers clean and unclean.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:26.200]   And then chapter 21, again, it's about the priesthood, right?
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.100]   And then the sacrifices, again, in chapter 23.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.740]   And then the last one, the blessing, discipline, and responses, is basically kind of like the
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.420]   application.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.880]   So this main point is done.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:42.700]   And then the last point in chapter 26 is, therefore, this is what God is doing.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.220]   Do you understand that?
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:50.020]   So if you can understand this outline, right?
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:57.740]   A, B, C, X, C, B, A. So what is the A?
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.300]   Without looking, what is the A?
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.300]   Sacrifice.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.300]   What is the B?
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.300]   What is the C?
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.300]   Huh?
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.480]   Clean and unclean.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.740]   So all you need to know is that, right?
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:15.500]   Sacrifices, priesthood, clean and unclean, and then day of atonement, and then that in
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.500]   reverse order.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.980]   So now you've got the whole outline.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:23.820]   And then chapter 26, the very last part of it, is God's blessing and discipline and our
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.140]   response.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:26.140]   You got it?
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.500]   That's, you got the whole outline of 26 chapters, okay?
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.540]   Now another way to look at it, and it's going to be the final thing that I said before I
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:39.340]   conclude, Leviticus can also be in the two big parts.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:46.580]   The first, A, B, C, talks about similar themes, but the emphasis is in priestly holiness at
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:50.540]   the tabernacle and what the priests are to do and how they ought to apply it.
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:55.940]   In the chapter 17 to 27, the second part of the chiasm is talking about the practical
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.940]   holiness of the people themselves.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:02.780]   So the emphasis in the first part of chiasm is toward the priest and the tabernacle.
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:08.380]   The second part of it is emphasis and application toward the people.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:09.380]   Get it?
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.380]   Okay.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:14.980]   So if you can memorize that without me, without you having to look and you have that in your
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.820]   head, I think that'll help you when we're studying.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:22.740]   If we're at a particular chapter, you know where we are in the outline, right?
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.780]   Hopefully.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.340]   You seem very tired tonight.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.540]   Okay, hopefully this is enough.
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:34.220]   Okay, so that's all I have for today's study, but hopefully this is enough for you to kind
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:39.940]   of get a broad outline so that we can jump into the text next time we're here.
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:45.380]   Again, so just to reiterate, so this part of it is for priests.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:49.700]   This part of it is for the people, but the theme is the same.
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.700]   Okay.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.940]   Your groups.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:56.100]   One, what is the first thing you think of when you think of holiness?
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:00.100]   There's a tendency to view holiness and grace as opposing ideas by some.
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.940]   Why do you think this is the case?
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.180]   Hopefully you understand what I mean by that.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.480]   Why is the practice of grace and holiness vital to our walk with God?
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.100]   What is the danger of neglecting one or the other?
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.380]   Clearly the scripture calls us to both, right?
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.900]   Grace does not negate holiness and holiness does not negate grace.
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.860]   It needs to be practiced both at the same time.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.220]   How do we do that and why is it important?
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.800]   And fourth is a very practical question.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.640]   In practicing holiness, and this is something that I've already discussed with our small
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:32.760]   group leaders that hopefully through our study of the book of Leviticus and as the subject
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:38.240]   of holiness comes up, I want our church to really wrestle with the application of holiness.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.840]   We don't just talk about the idea of holiness, but how should holiness be applied in our
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:51.000]   daily lives, in what we watch, where we go, what we talk about, our conversations, the
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.880]   music that we listen to.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.480]   So what is holiness practically in the life of a Christian?
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:02.360]   Now we don't want to get into a situation where we say a holy life is these ten things,
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:07.100]   but I think we should be mindful about how to apply it in a practical way.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:13.240]   And so the question that I have here is pertaining to entertainment because it is so prevalent
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.520]   in our culture.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.920]   What principles are given in the scriptures for us to follow and determine whether something
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.600]   is or is not wise for a Christian to participate in?
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.520]   So the other extreme of this is where I hear people say, "Well, where do we draw the line
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:31.160]   so we can't draw the line or else we become legalistic so we don't draw the line at all?"
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:38.320]   Where we're so in fear of being called judgmental or legalistic where we don't discuss enough
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.160]   about what it means to live holy lives.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:45.040]   So I'm hoping that your small group discussions will get into the nitty-gritty of what that
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.040]   means.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:52.320]   Again, we're not determining for you what holiness is, but as we're studying it, I'm
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.280]   hoping that the small groups will lead to these practical applications of what we're
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   talking about.
