[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:52.020]   - And welcome to our Good Friday service.
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.820]   I hope you're able to follow along
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.520]   and reflect on the events of this week,
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.020]   leading up to the crucifixion of Christ,
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.220]   the greatest display of God's love towards sinners.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.600]   And I was reminded this week
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   of just how unworthy I am of Christ.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.600]   And yet I have great worth because of Christ.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   Christ died for me and you,
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.100]   not because we are worthy, but because we are unworthy,
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.100]   and there was no other way to make us worthy.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.600]   And it's not a fair trade.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.600]   The Son of God died.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   Rebels, sinners like me live.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.600]   And that's not fair.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.600]   But that's grace, that's kindness, that's mercy.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.100]   So let us praise the Lord together for His mercy is more.

[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   - Good evening, everyone.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.600]   I wanna again welcome everybody to this evening service.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   What an absolute privilege for us to worship
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.600]   and give thanks to our Lord.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.600]   As we continue on reflecting this evening,
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.600]   we're gonna be hearing a message
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.600]   concerning the sacrificial death of Christ
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.600]   from Pastor Nate, and afterwards,
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.600]   we're going to be participating in the communion together.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.600]   Just as a quick reminder that this Sunday,
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.600]   we're gonna have our 6 a.m. early rise service,
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.600]   but I wanna make mention that that's going to be
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   only in the outside courtyard.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   And because it is early, it's gonna be cold.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.600]   Please make sure that you come kind of ready,
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   whether with blankets and being dressed warm.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   But again, with everything that's been taking place,
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.600]   we do ask just come a little bit early
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.600]   so that we can get situated and start service promptly.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.600]   As we enter into worship tonight,
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.600]   let's take a moment to pray together.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   Let's bow our heads.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:59.600]   Heavenly Father, we are so grateful to you.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   What an absolute blessing to us
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.600]   that God, we can join together
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.600]   and give to you this thanks for your incredible sacrifice.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.600]   Father, as I think about the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus,
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.600]   Lord, we recognize we want to just take a long look
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.600]   and dwell upon what that means for us.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   For we know, Father God, that in the death of Christ,
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.600]   that to us is freedom.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   That means, Father God, for us forgiveness and so much more.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.600]   And to think, Lord, just as Peter mentioned, God,
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.600]   what an exchange, what incredible paradox
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   that the death of Christ would mean for us life.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.600]   And so, God, I pray that we would reflect,
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.600]   that that would turn into worship and praise,
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   and to think, Lord God, in some sense,
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.600]   for us just to simply lift up our songs, lift up our words,
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.600]   it's no sacrifice to us, it's nothing.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   But, Father, we recognize what you've given us
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   is so beyond anything we can pay back.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.600]   It's so incredibly weighty that we can do none other
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.600]   than to thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.600]   And so we pray, Father, that as we worship you,
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.600]   may it reflect our heart's desire to offer up everything to you,
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.600]   and God, may you be pleased.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.600]   We thank you and love you for all that you are
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.600]   and all that you've done for us.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   It's in Christ that we pray, amen.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.600]   Would you please stand with us as we continue our worship?
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   [music]
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:58.600]   When I survey the wondrous cross
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:09.600]   On which the Prince of Glory died
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:20.600]   He enriches me, I am the lost
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:34.600]   Therefore content of all my pride
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:44.600]   From His hand, His hands, His feet
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   Sorrow and love flow before me, pour down
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:06.600]   Death, as such, love and sorrow meet
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:16.600]   O Lord's comfort, so rich a crown
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:27.600]   O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   Leads me from end to end, and from that end to be free
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:49.600]   O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:55.600]   All who gather here, I pray strongly
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:02.600]   Bless your name
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:13.600]   Let the whole realm of nature bow
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:22.600]   That we're an offering far too small
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   Love so amazing
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.600]   So divine
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:44.600]   Deep as my soul, my God, my all
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:55.600]   O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:06.600]   Leads me from end to end, and from that end to be free
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.600]   All who gather here, I pray strongly
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.600]   Bless your name
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.600]   Wonderful cross
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:50.600]   Leads me from end to end, and from that end to be free
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:22:01.600]   O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:08.600]   All who gather here, I pray strongly
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.600]   Bless your name
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:25.600]   [music]
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   Should nothing of our efforts stand
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:37.600]   No legacy survive
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:45.600]   Unless the Lord has raised the house in fire
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.600]   It's filled with strife
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:57.600]   Tomorrow's tomorrow's can tell me
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.600]   What is your life
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:08.600]   A mass that vanishes and doth
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:14.600]   All glory be to Christ
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:20.600]   All glory be to Christ our King
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:26.600]   All glory be to Christ
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:33.600]   His rule and reign will never cease
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:40.600]   All glory be to Christ
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:48.600]   His rule, His rule, His eye, His kingdom come
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:54.600]   All glory, His is above
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.600]   Who is He so far
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.600]   Steady by the grace of heaven
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   In the world of our hearts
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:13.600]   Living water, satisfied
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:19.600]   The thirsty red-mouthed fowls
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:25.600]   Will take the cup of Thy will
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.600]   All glory be to Christ
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:37.600]   All glory, all glory be to Christ our King
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:43.600]   All glory be to Christ
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:49.600]   His rule and reign will never cease
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:57.600]   All glory be to Christ
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.600]   [music]
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.600]   On the day the plague died
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   I am the faithful and the true
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.600]   The Lamb who was spoken
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   Sinners slain is made
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.600]   And all things found
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:27.600]   Old and young, old and young
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.600]   Shall live with us
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:36.600]   And in our steadfast house
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:42.600]   And we shall ever, Jesus people be
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:48.600]   All glory be to Christ
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:54.600]   All glory be to Christ our King
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:00.600]   All glory be to Christ
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:06.600]   His rule and reign will never cease
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   All glory be to Christ
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:19.600]   All glory be to Christ our King
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:25.600]   All glory be to Christ
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:31.600]   His rule and reign will never cease
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:37.600]   All glory be to Christ
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:43.600]   All glory be to Christ our King
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:49.600]   All glory be to Christ
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   His rule and reign will never cease
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   All glory be to Christ
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.600]   Amen, may it be so.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:15.600]   [music]
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:21.600]   Okay, well, welcome to our Good Friday service once again.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:30.600]   My name is Nathan, and this is actually more and more as I've been walking with Christ.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:35.600]   Growing up, Easter and Passion Week wasn't that big of a deal.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.600]   It wasn't something that we especially celebrated.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   And what's been interesting is, man, I've grown to appreciate Easter so much
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:49.600]   where I think it's slowly becoming one of my favorite holidays.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.600]   Which is very strange, you know, because how do you displace Christmas?
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.600]   But what I realized is, especially walking through the Passion Week over the last few years here at Berean
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:05.600]   and together with all of you, is that we are able to walk the steps of Christ
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:11.600]   all the way to the cross and eventually celebrate the resurrection of Christ on Sunday.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:20.600]   I think it's a holiday that is possibly one of the, like, maybe the freer of distractions from all the other holidays.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   I think we have an opportunity every year at this time to celebrate something that is so strange for the world
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:33.600]   if we tell them what we're celebrating, the death of the one that we proclaim to be our king.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   And tonight, Good Friday, and we've said this many, many times in the past before,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   man, why would we call it good?
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.600]   Why would we call something like this something to be celebrated?
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   What are we doing here, gathering together, taking time to think about his death?
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.600]   Shouldn't we be people who think about the resurrection?
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.600]   Shouldn't we be people who consider that to be the pinnacle of everything?
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:11.600]   Like, what is it about the death that is so important that we would gather here on some random Friday night
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:19.600]   to take a whole week to lead up to this time when Jesus finally is killed?
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:24.600]   All week we've been doing this. We've been going down this path that Jesus walked
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.600]   to crucifixion.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.600]   We've been saying day after day that every step was intentional,
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.600]   that everything he was doing was volitional,
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   that he was making choices and decisions.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   No one had a gun to his head to force him down this path.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:53.600]   Jesus was doing it because he wanted to.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.600]   And we know that Jesus was innocent.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.600]   He was the only one in history to have never sinned.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   Consider that. Take a moment to really think about that.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   He was the only person in history to have never sinned.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.600]   We're talking about a flawless person.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   He never lusted. He was never slothful.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   He was perfect in righteous anger.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:25.600]   He loved everyone he came across. Again, take a moment to think about that.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:33.600]   He loved every person.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.600]   This wasn't just a restraint of sin in his life.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.600]   This was who he was.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   If out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks,
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:50.600]   then the taming of the tongue isn't going to be the thing that changes whether we're sinning or not.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.600]   It's from where it flows.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:59.600]   It's the heart. And Jesus' heart was sinless.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.600]   When we visit that age-old question,
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.600]   and I think it's healthy to think about that every once in a while,
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.600]   which is if you're to die tonight,
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   if you came face to face with the creator,
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   with the God who made you,
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.600]   regardless of who you are right now, right?
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.600]   All of us, one day, if we were to die tonight,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   and we came face to face with the God who created me,
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.600]   who made me,
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:33.600]   and he judged you upon a good standard,
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   a righteous standard,
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:43.600]   what would be the only way for you to be allowed entrance into the kingdom of God?
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.600]   It's perfection.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.600]   It's zero sin.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   You have to be flawless.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.600]   It's not just the controlling of the tongue.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   It's the heart.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.600]   It's not just a restraint of sinful activity.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.600]   It's who you are.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   You have to be perfect.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:14.600]   Meaning this, Jesus alone would be able to fulfill the standard to enter into the kingdom of God.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   Right?
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.600]   That's a logical conclusion.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.600]   There was only one person in all of history ever to be sinless,
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.600]   flawless, and without any blame,
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.600]   wholly righteous, and that's Jesus.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.600]   And he is then the only one who should be able to enter into the kingdom of God,
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.600]   which leaves us at a conundrum,
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.600]   a very fascinating place.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.600]   Who is in heaven now?
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:49.600]   Who will be in heaven in the times to come?
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:54.600]   The answer is, besides Christ, no one else should be in heaven.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   Right?
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.600]   If that is the standard, and Jesus is the only one,
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.600]   then no one should be allowed entrance into the kingdom of God ever.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.600]   Heaven ought to be empty.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.600]   That's the logical thing.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.600]   The only way that God could remain a good God,
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.600]   a just God,
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   perfect in his standards,
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.600]   and upholding his righteousness,
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.600]   would be an empty heaven.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:34.600]   And hell should house every single one of us.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.600]   Every single one.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.600]   Every single human.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.600]   The Bible is clear.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.600]   It says this in Romans chapter 3 verse 10,
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.600]   "There is none righteous, not even one."
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.600]   I love that.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.600]   Not even one.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.600]   Not a single person who is pure.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.600]   Good intentions are not enough.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:59.600]   Morally doing more good than evil is not enough.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.600]   Because it's not only what you do, but it's who you are.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.600]   We are sinners.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.600]   We are objects of God's wrath.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.600]   We are born rebelling against God.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.600]   We hate God.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   We are insolent.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.600]   We're arrogant.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.600]   Altogether filthy.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.600]   Which leads us to the next obvious conclusion,
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.600]   which comes in Romans 3 verse 23,
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   We fall short of his glory.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   We fall short of his standard.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.600]   We fall short of the person of who he is.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   And we fall short of heaven's door.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   In fact, it's not only that we are denied entrance into heaven,
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   but in Romans 6 verse 23, it goes further to say,
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.600]   "For the wages of sin is death."
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.600]   So it's not only that we are not allowed entrance into the kingdom of God,
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.600]   but what that means is that this is certain death for us.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.600]   And it's not death.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.600]   Death would be nice if I was annihilated,
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:04.600]   but this is eternal death.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   There's a problem we're left with here.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:18.600]   You see, there should have been a sure, swift, and immediate death for all of us.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:26.600]   There should be no hope of heaven for any of us.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:31.600]   The problem is there shouldn't be eventual death.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.600]   There shouldn't be a delayed death.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   As soon as we exist, we should be eternally dead.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.600]   We should fall under his eternal wrath.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   This is weird because I'm breathing.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.600]   There are 7.5 billion people breathing in this world.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:02.600]   7.5 billion hearts that are beating right now.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:12.600]   This is a problem because if God is good and just, how can we exist?
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.600]   There should be no space or opportunity for life
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:27.600]   because every breath I take as a sinner should be an outrage for God.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   This is the only fair thing, but people continue to walk.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:37.600]   Our very existence ought to cause us to question God's goodness and justice.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:44.600]   The fact that any sinner walks around should not make any sense to us.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   Just as if you were to see a raping, murderous, hateful, walking person free for even a single day,
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.600]   that should be like, "No, that should not be allowed to happen."
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   That any of us are existing, are breathing, are living, should be an outrage.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   But God, He keeps saving.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   He keeps preserving.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   And the fingerprints of God's grace is found all over history from day one.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:27.600]   Some people see the God of the Old Testament as someone who is judging and wrathful and awful.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:34.600]   And to you, and sometimes, honestly, sometimes my heart questions.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:41.600]   So to my own heart, I ask this question like, "Really?"
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.600]   Because the more I read Scripture, the more I come to know who God is.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:52.600]   Did you know the Old Testament God, I find Him to be absurdly gracious,
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:38:00.600]   incredibly, incredibly kind and patient?
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:16.600]   Because again, every breath taken by a single human is God's sustaining, intentional gift of grace and mercy and love and kindness to us.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:21.600]   In the Old Testament, I'm going to take us through a few Bible passages here just to paint a picture.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:26.600]   In the Old Testament, we see that death, though it should have come immediately, doesn't come.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   Look at Genesis 2, verse 16.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:34.600]   "The Lord God commanded the man, saying, 'From any tree of the garden you may eat freely,
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:40.600]   but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it, you will surely die.'"
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:47.600]   Again, this should leave us with the problem, because it says, "In the day that you eat from that fruit," what will happen?
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.600]   "You will surely die."
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.600]   It even says, "Surely."
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.600]   It doesn't just say, "You will die."
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   It is certain to happen.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.600]   "You will surely die."
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.600]   But the problem is chapter 3 happens.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:08.600]   That's a big problem to God's goodness and justice and to His Word.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.600]   Look what happens.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.600]   Genesis 3, verse 6.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.600]   "When the women saw that the tree was good for food," and here it is.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.600]   She's walking up to this tree and to this fruit and says, "And it was a delight to the eyes,
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.600]   and that the tree was desirable to make one wise.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:28.600]   She took from its fruit, ate it, and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate it."
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   They should be dead.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.600]   But it says, "Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked,
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.600]   and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings."
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.600]   You know what this is called?
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:45.600]   This is called grace.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.600]   In Genesis 4, verse 8, Cain.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.600]   Here's what it says.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.600]   "Cain told Abel his brother," I'm sure we all know this story,
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   "and it came about when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him."
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.600]   Talk about sin spiral.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   This is literally the next generation.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.600]   These are Adam and Eve's kids.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   And murder happens.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.600]   It isn't a slow devolution.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.600]   It's immediately just murder.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.600]   Can you imagine that?
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   And you would think as soon as God sees Cain kill Abel, it's like, "Oh, that's it."
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.600]   Kaput, right?
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.600]   That's it.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:30.600]   But it says in verse 15, "And the Lord appointed a sign for Cain so that no one finding him would slay him."
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:37.600]   I have no other explanation other than this is grace.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:42.600]   In Genesis 6, verse 5, it says, "And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth."
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.600]   It's huge.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   This word "great," you have to use your exaggerated mind.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:54.600]   There's just rampant wickedness in the world.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:59.600]   "And that every intent of the thoughts of his heart"--can you go any deeper?
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.600]   "Every intent of the thoughts of his heart"--there's so much.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   You see that?
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   Intent, thoughts, heart.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:10.600]   It's going deeper and deeper, and it says that that was only evil continually.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:16.600]   That means without end, innumerable, and abundant.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.600]   "And the Lord was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and he was grieved in his heart.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:28.600]   Then the Lord said, 'I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals, to creeping things, and to birds of the sky, for I am sorry that I have made them.'"
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:33.600]   Now look at the intentional God at work here to preserve and be gracious to people.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:39.600]   In chapter 8, verse 1, "But God remembered."
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:45.600]   Man, I would love for us not to have Noah here as the main thing.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.600]   I would like to say, like, let's focus on those first three words.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.600]   "But God remembered."
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.600]   God remembered Noah and all the beasts and the cattle.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.600]   Noah is counted with the beasts and the cattle.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:04.600]   God, the point is God remembered.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   And God, he caught, it's not a wind came to pass.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.600]   God caused the wind to pass over the earth, and the water subsided.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.600]   It was intentional.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.600]   Also, the fountains of the deep and the floodgates of the sky were closed.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.600]   There's an active person in this, and that's God.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   He closed it, and the rain from the sky was restrained.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   Who restrained it? God restrained it.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.600]   And the water receded steadily from the earth.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.600]   And at the end of 150 days, the water decreased.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.600]   In the seventh month, on the 17th day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.600]   The water decreased steadily until the 10th month.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.600]   In the 10th month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains became visible.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:48.600]   I have no other explanation than this is called grace.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.600]   You see the Tower of Babel?
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:57.600]   God could have smote, I forgot the past tense, smited, you know, whatever.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:03.600]   God could have done that to everyone, right? And he should have.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.600]   He just scatters them.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.600]   It's grace. He keeps saving. He keeps preserving mankind.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:15.600]   In the patriarchs, when you read the stories of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Joseph,
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   when you look at the story of Israel in the wilderness, with Moses and Joshua,
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.600]   when you see the story of Israel during the time of judges,
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.600]   these are all the different stories that Pastor Peter has been taking us through,
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.600]   through the book of Hebrews and the hall of faith.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   When we see all these people, you can't help, when you read the Old Testament,
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:41.600]   to see the sinfulness and the wickedness, even in what we would consider the best of us.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.600]   In the best king, in the best judge, in the best patriarch.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:50.600]   It is just rampant evil in these people.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:55.600]   And what you see is God's grace over and over and over and over again.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:01.600]   It does not stop. It's not stopping. It's continual.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:05.600]   And his patience just keeps going.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.600]   You get through a certain part of the Old Testament, you want to tear your hair out.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.600]   What are you doing?
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:17.600]   How could anyone be this kind?
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.600]   How can you let these people breathe?
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.600]   Their very existence is an affront to you.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:30.600]   How can this be?
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:35.600]   When you look at the kings that are supposed to be the type of Christ,
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:40.600]   even one we would consider perhaps the best, Hezekiah.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:45.600]   You see at the end of his life, in the final 15 years of his life,
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.600]   which by the way, Hezekiah, when he gets diseased,
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:54.600]   and then he cries out to God and he's in turmoil because he doesn't want to die.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.600]   And so God extends his life 15 years.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:03.600]   And in that last 15 years that he was extended, he goes on to sin.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:09.600]   And he is the one who opens up Judah to Babylon.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   And during those last 15 years of God's extended grace in his life,
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:21.600]   he fathers Manasseh, who is perhaps one of the worst kings.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.600]   God is the one just saving and preserving and saving and preserving.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:31.600]   Every page of the Old Testament is grace upon grace upon grace upon grace.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   The prophets come about and there's just warnings all over, right?
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.600]   What is God going to do?
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.600]   What God is going to do to you if you do not turn?
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:47.600]   You look at it and you can see like, man, God is grumpy.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:52.600]   Come on, parents out there.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   Why do you warn your kids?
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.600]   Why do you warn your kids that if you continue down the path you're going,
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:05.600]   you are going to get a little spanking?
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:14.600]   Because you want them to stop and you want them to be good, right?
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.600]   And so that warning, how many of you parents have said like,
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:22.600]   "I don't want to do this"?
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.600]   I feel that almost every time when I spank my kids.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.600]   I don't want to. It hurts me, actually.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.600]   I get really sad.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.600]   Why? Because I love them.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:43.600]   And so my warnings is love.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:49.600]   God, he cares. He loves so much.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.600]   See, the wrath stuff should make complete sense.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.600]   The grace stuff makes no sense.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:01.600]   In the Old Testament, the wrath stuff should be like, "Yeah!"
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:06.600]   And the grace stuff should be like, "What?
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.600]   What is God doing?"
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:12.600]   It should honestly make you question his goodness.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:21.600]   It should honestly make you question his justice.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:27.600]   Did you know that every breath you and I take is a demonstration of God's grace?
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:32.600]   We ought to be wiped out, but God stays true in his loving kindness and his steadfast love.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.600]   Because we were born into the world as sinners and rebellious,
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:41.600]   there is no way the Holy Creator God should be able to coexist with sinners.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:45.600]   And so the question is still, "How does this work?
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:50.600]   How does God remain good and just?"
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.600]   You and I, we are entitled people.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.600]   We are selfish people.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:01.600]   At heart, we are adulterers and we are murderers.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.600]   We break every command of God.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.600]   Our very existence is sin.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.600]   There is no best of us.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   There is none righteous, not even one.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:16.600]   We are all susceptible to the evils that we see around us.
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:24.600]   And it should invoke an immediate eternal death sentence in our lives.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.600]   If you pause to look around this room,
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.600]   if you pause to go outside and look around at this world,
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.600]   even with all the chaos going on,
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:36.600]   if you're looking at reality, all you see, all over the place,
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.600]   God's fingerprints of grace.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.600]   Everywhere.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.600]   Everywhere.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:52.600]   Seven and a half billion examples of God's grace.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.600]   This is who God is.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:58.600]   In Exodus 34, 6, we'll go through just a number of passages here
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.600]   that describes who He is.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   Then the Lord, this is when He goes in front of Moses and He goes past.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.600]   And I always thought this was really funny.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:13.600]   It's like this voice comes out as the presence of God,
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.600]   the very sight of God passes by Moses.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.600]   And the Lord passed by in front of him and proclaimed.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.600]   It's so funny.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.600]   The Lord, the Lord God.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   He could have chosen so many different ways to describe who He was.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.600]   But in this specific time, as He's passing by Moses,
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:36.600]   He chooses to describe a very particular portion
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:39.600]   or a particular attribute of who He is.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:43.600]   Because He could have easily have said the thrice holy thing.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.600]   He could have easily have said, "I am a wrathful and good unjust God."
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.600]   He could have said a lot of things, but instead He chooses to say,
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:55.600]   as He passes by this creature, "compassionate and gracious,
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.600]   slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness and truth."
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.600]   That is what is proclaimed.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:05.600]   Because Moses should have died in His presence.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.600]   But God shields him.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.600]   And this is how He's described.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:13.600]   Psalm 86 5, "For you, Lord, are good and ready to forgive
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.600]   and abundant in loving kindness to all who call upon you."
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:18.600]   All who call upon you.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.600]   And it's proven in Jonah 4 2.
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:22.600]   And Jonah knows this of God.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.600]   He prayed to the Lord and said, "Please, Lord,
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.600]   was not this what I said while I was still in my own country?"
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.600]   Because Assyria turns, all of Nineveh turns.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.600]   It says, "Therefore, in order to forestall this, I fled to Tarshish,
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:37.600]   for I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God,
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.600]   slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness,
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.600]   and one who relents concerning calamity."
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   Nehemiah 9 31, "Nevertheless, in your great compassion,
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.600]   you did not make an end of them or forsake them,
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.600]   for you are a gracious and compassionate God."
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:55.600]   To conclude, Numbers 14 18 says, "The Lord is slow to anger
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.600]   and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression."
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   This is who He is.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:04.600]   But -- we could stop there.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.600]   And, oh, man, so happy, right?
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:15.600]   But He will by no means clear the guilty.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:25.600]   Visiting the iniquity of the fathers and the children to the third and the fourth generations.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:33.600]   Have we become so entitled that we live our lives,
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:41.600]   and we complain, and we question God's goodness and grace?
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:48.600]   Don't we understand that our comprehension of His love for us,
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:51.600]   it can't happen.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:59.600]   It will just continue.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:03.600]   God is altogether gracious and kind,
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.600]   and it should actually cause us to want to say,
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:14.600]   "This isn't fair, that you would let me live."
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:21.600]   This is the biblical worldview.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.600]   With all this talk of God's grace and compassion,
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.600]   as we saw at the end of Numbers there,
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.600]   God's justice must be met.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.600]   He is still good.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.600]   He is still just.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:37.600]   He is still perfect in His standard.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.600]   So it says this in Romans 2, verse 5.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.600]   "But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart,
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.600]   you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   in revelation of the righteous judgment of God,
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.600]   who will render to --" can I highlight this?
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.600]   "Each person."
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:57.600]   That means it includes every single person that has ever been born.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:01.600]   Every person in this room I'm talking to, to you and to me,
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:05.600]   he will render to each person according to his deeds.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.600]   To those who by perseverance and doing good seek for glory and honor
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.600]   and immortality and eternal life,
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.600]   but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth,
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.600]   but obey unrighteousness, wrath, and indignation,
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.600]   there will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:21.600]   who does evil of the Jew first and also of the Greek."
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   What that means is there's nothing that a single person will ever get away with.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.600]   Talk about all the evil that we see in the world right now.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:33.600]   Right now we have some man-made righteousness going everywhere, right?
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.600]   But talk about all the evil going on in the world.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:42.600]   We see there is no single person that will get away with a single thing.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.600]   This is guaranteed.
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:49.600]   That's why one day we die, come before our Maker, our Creator,
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:55.600]   and we will have to give an account.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.600]   See, our standard of human justice pales in comparison
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:02.600]   to what is being stored for unbelieving people.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   But this is not just for them because we are no better.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   Every human is going to have to account for this.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.600]   In 2 Corinthians 5, verse 10, it says,
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.600]   "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.600]   so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds."
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   That means you will get what you deserve.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:26.600]   "In the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad."
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.600]   So what is that supposed to look like?
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.600]   What does it look like if I get just recompense?
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.600]   I think the closest that we can get to a picture of it
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:42.600]   is found in the book of Revelation.
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:46.600]   A picture of God's wrath made clear if you look at Revelation.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.600]   There are seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls,
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:52.600]   and I'm just going to describe these things to you.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:56.600]   In the seals, you see war and bloodshed, famine, plagues,
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:55:00.600]   which wipe out a quarter of the world's population,
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:03.600]   martyrdom, huge earthquakes, blackened sun, red moons,
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.600]   stars that fall to earth.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:10.600]   Many cry out in the middle of this wrath that they want to die.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.600]   And then the trumpets come.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.600]   Hail, this is like hail on steroids,
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.600]   just hail and fire and death, darkening of the sun.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:25.600]   Can you imagine if the sun just blotted out?
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.600]   There are torturing demonic locust plagues,
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:32.600]   all which kill a third.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:35.600]   I mean, all of this stuff together kills a third of plant life,
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.600]   a majority of the earth's aquatic life,
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.600]   ultimately a third of humanity.
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:42.600]   And that's not even done yet.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   The bowls come, painful sores, blisters on all humanity,
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:50.600]   every person blisters, death of every living thing in the sea,
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:53.600]   every single living thing in the sea, death.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.600]   Rivers turn to blood, the sun's heat intensifying,
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.600]   darkness that falls upon the earth,
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.600]   an army that marches across the world,
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:03.600]   and another massive earthquake that precedes a hail storm,
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:08.600]   giant blocks of ice.
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:13.600]   That's not a bedtime story I'm giving to my kids.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:20.600]   I think that this is the closest I can imagine God's wrath.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.600]   It's pretty intense.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:32.600]   But what we see in Revelation is not even a speck on the tip of an iceberg
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.600]   of what God's wrath looks like.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:41.600]   Just recompense, like all this stuff,
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:45.600]   it doesn't even scratch the surface of how deep this goes,
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.600]   of what we deserve in God's wrath,
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:55.600]   and how furious he is against sin.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.600]   We have such a skewed view of sin,
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:04.600]   and the Bible paints it accurately.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.600]   See, when we think of hell,
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:15.600]   what you see in Revelation is like people will dream of that.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:24.600]   Like how great that would be compared to the fury of hell.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:28.600]   See, the fact that we're walking around the way we are,
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:31.600]   and the fact that not every single one of us are in hell right now,
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:39.600]   experiencing that, is God's grace.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   It's God's grace.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:51.600]   The wrath of God is coming,
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:58.600]   but what that means is today I can't help but see my life and your life,
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.600]   and the fact that we exist here in this world as it is now,
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:07.600]   as God's grace.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.600]   And when His wrath comes,
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.600]   when the day of judgment comes,
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:17.600]   there will be no hiding.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:20.600]   There will be no more continued patience.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:23.600]   There will be no more kindness.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:29.600]   There won't be any more desiring,
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:37.600]   or having this opportunity to come to the Lord.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.600]   There will be no running from this wrath.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:44.600]   It is a guarantee that every sin will be repaid in full,
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:46.600]   without a single drop overlooked.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:47.600]   Why?
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:55.600]   Because God is good, and He is just.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:57.600]   There will be no hiding on that day,
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.600]   and it says that in Amos chapter 9, verse 1-4,
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   "I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and He said,
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.600]   'Smite the capitals so that the thresholds will shake,
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.600]   and break them on the heads of them all.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.600]   Then I will slay the rest of them with a sword.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.600]   They will not have a fugitive who will flee,
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:13.600]   or a refugee who will escape.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.600]   Though they dig into Sheol, from there will My hand take them.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:19.600]   Though they ascend to heaven, from there will I bring them down.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:21.600]   Though they hide on the summit of Carmel,
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.600]   I will search them out and take them from there.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:27.600]   And though they conceal themselves from My sight on the floor of the sea,
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.600]   and from there I will command the serpent, and it will bite them.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:33.600]   And though they go into captivity before the enemies,
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.600]   from there I will command the sword that it slay them.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:39.600]   And I will set My eyes against them for evil and not for good.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.600]   And this is going to be a reality for all humanity
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.600]   that encounters God's wrath in full.
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:49.600]   That they will want to hide, but there will be no hiding,
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:51.600]   and this will be for eternity.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   This is depressing.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:59.600]   But again, we are not there yet.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.600]   And just like in the Old Testament where we're wondering
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.600]   why the next chapters keep going,
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.600]   what we have to do is question why,
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.600]   if I encounter an unbeliever here in this world,
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.600]   why his chapters keep going?
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.600]   And then in the Old Testament, if it was because of God's grace,
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.600]   then I can't help but look at his life and realize
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.600]   that this is God's grace in his life.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.600]   And then when I ask the question of God,
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.600]   why do you let him continue?
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.600]   It's because he desires none to perish and for all to come to repentance.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.600]   Then when I see this unbelieving person,
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.600]   then I need to understand and know that God desires for this person
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.600]   not to perish and to come to repentance.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.600]   It is His grace.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.600]   And so as we sit here on Good Friday,
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.600]   a week where Jesus intentionally marches to the cross,
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:46.600]   where we see this great intersection of God's grace and His wrath,
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:51.600]   of His fury and His love for us,
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:55.600]   when we see the great intersection of it,
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.600]   that we understand that God is not just partly gracious, partly just.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.600]   It's not like He has 50% this, He has 50% that.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.600]   It's not that. He is fully gracious.
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.600]   He is fully just.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.600]   And what we see at the cross is where we see it,
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:17.600]   where we marvel, where we stand dumbstruck and awestruck
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.600]   at the God that He is.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.600]   What we see at the cross brings us to a place
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   where it's hard to make sense of any of it.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.600]   Literally, the cross leaves us at a place
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:38.600]   where the only possible thing is worship.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.600]   It leaves us in awe and wonder and amazement
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.600]   because all of this stored judgment
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.600]   that all humanity is meant to pay for,
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:56.600]   all humanity will one day meet as God pours out judgment on the earth.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.600]   This is a crazy thing
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.600]   because the possibility of people continuing in God's grace
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.600]   is because of tonight.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:15.600]   Because God's judgment and wrath
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.600]   for anyone who would place their faith in Him
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:27.600]   would in full, not a single drop unaccounted for,
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.600]   be pressed onto Jesus Christ.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.600]   This is what Jesus was every day this week,
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:38.600]   every day of His life, walking towards intentionally.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.600]   Wrath.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:48.600]   Jesus knew this.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.600]   And we're going to just end this time.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.600]   It's going to be a little bit lengthy,
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.600]   so don't take that cue to say we're almost done.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.600]   But let's look at Jesus.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:02.600]   And this is where you need to do some work for me
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.600]   in imagining this.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.600]   What Jesus is walking towards.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.600]   Wrath.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.600]   Matthew 26, 38.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.600]   "My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.600]   "Remain here and keep watch with me.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.600]   "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me,
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.600]   "yet not as I will, but as you will.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.600]   "My Father, if this cannot pass away until I drink it,
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.600]   "unless I drink it, your will be done."
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.600]   Jesus is grieved deeply.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   He is going to take hell.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:41.600]   And so what we see this night is Judas completing
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.600]   his betrayal of Jesus on this Friday,
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.600]   kissing Jesus on the cheek as a sign to the mob
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.600]   of people wielding swords and clubs,
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.600]   directly sent from the chief priests
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.600]   who have been trying to trap him,
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.600]   and elders who had sent them.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.600]   And Peter tries to stop them, and he pulls out his sword,
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.600]   and he strikes the ear of the slave.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   Now, how brave of Peter to go after the slave, you know?
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.600]   He chooses to pip-squeak.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.600]   But Jesus didn't need Peter to rescue him
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.600]   because he was walking this path.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.600]   Jesus says, in a single word,
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.600]   snap of the fingers, 12 legions of angels.
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.600]   And if you do the math, at least 72,000 angels
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:25.600]   would be at his beckoning to descend and to rescue,
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.600]   and it would be a wrathful massacre,
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.600]   giving people just recompense.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:37.600]   We see back in history,
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.600]   one angel wipes out 185,000 of Sennacherib's army
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.600]   in a single night.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.600]   You have 72,000 angels on a snap of his fingers
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.600]   to do what is right.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.600]   He says, "Peter, what you doing?"
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:59.600]   And then Jesus walks before this human, Caiaphas,
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.600]   and this human council.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.600]   And Peter keeps his distance.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:08.600]   This human keeps his distance and denies Jesus three times.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   And these humans, chief priests, and the whole council,
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:15.600]   they attempt to find false testimony on Jesus Christ.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:20.600]   But there's none available because he lived his life perfectly.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:25.600]   Even though many false witnesses come forward,
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.600]   they are not believed because he lived unbelievably above reproach.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:36.600]   But they find a way to get at Jesus and cry, "Blasphemy!"
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.600]   And then Matthew 26, 67, these humans.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.600]   Imagine Jesus here.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.600]   What he's doing to take the sins of the world.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:51.600]   Where he's marching towards so that I might not experience that.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.600]   These humans come, and they spat in his face,
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.600]   and beat him with their fists,
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.600]   and others slapped him and said, "Prophesy to us, you Christ!
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.600]   Who is the one who hit you?"
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.600]   The answer is all of us.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:10.600]   Peter again spends his time denying Jesus.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.600]   What we see here, you know, these days we see a popular thing
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.600]   where people say, "Don't look away from the atrocities that you see in this world.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.600]   Don't look away, don't look away."
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.600]   You know, I agree with this sentiment.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.600]   We shouldn't.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.600]   We should grieve, we should hurt.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:31.600]   But I'd like to apply it here, asking us all this Good Friday to look at the reality.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:38.600]   Because all mankind deserves is God's wrath.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:43.600]   We can't look away at the fact that what Jesus is doing here and walking towards this,
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.600]   it's absurd.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:53.600]   Don't ever look away at what Jesus was doing here.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.600]   Jesus is continuing to willingly, intentionally walk to the very point
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.600]   which he would absorb the wrath.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:02.600]   And everything that's happening to Jesus up to this point
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.600]   is still nothing compared to the wrath to come.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.600]   So what they do is they bind Jesus.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.600]   Humans bind Jesus' hands.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.600]   And they deliver him to Pilate, another human.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.600]   And he asked Jesus, "Are you the King of the Jews?"
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.600]   Upon which Jesus responds, "It is as you say."
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.600]   And they enter into the custom of allowing one prisoner to be freed by popular consent.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.600]   And so a notorious prisoner by the name of Barabbas
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:28.600]   is the one they scream for, to free him.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:32.600]   The noted killer, the insurrectionist, to free him.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:36.600]   And the innocent Christ, the Son of God, to be brutally tortured and murdered on the cross.
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:42.600]   And so they take Jesus into the praetorium and gather the whole Roman cohort now.
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.600]   And they strip Jesus.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.600]   And they put a scarlet robe on him.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.600]   And they twist together a crown of thorns.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.600]   And they place it on his head.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.600]   And they jam it down into his skull.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.600]   And then they mock him.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.600]   And then they spit on him some more.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.600]   And then they beat him on the head.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:10.600]   And they crucify Jesus on that cross.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.600]   Next to two robbers.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:17.600]   And even there Jesus takes time to speak words of comfort to one of them.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:22.600]   Now let me read the rest of the account in Matthew.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.600]   Verse 45.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:28.600]   As we see the final breath of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:32.600]   Now from the sixth hour darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.600]   And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice saying,
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.600]   "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.600]   That is my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.600]   And some of those who were standing there when they heard it began saying,
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:46.600]   "This man is calling for Elijah."
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.600]   Immediately one of them ran and taking a sponge he filled it with sour wine
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.600]   and put it on a reed and gave him a drink.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:57.600]   But the rest of them said, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:08.600]   And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   He dies.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:19.600]   He dies and at this point he is absorbing.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.600]   You know what is going on at this point?
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.600]   The wrath of God.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:34.600]   This is not like a little hiatus in his existence.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.600]   He is absorbing it.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.600]   I don't know exactly how that looks.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.600]   Maybe it will be explained to us.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.600]   But that is what is happening.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.600]   And so in verse 51 it says,
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.600]   "And behold the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.600]   and the earth shook and the rocks were split.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:58.600]   The tombs were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.600]   And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.600]   And now the centurion and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:10.600]   when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening became very frightened
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:13.600]   and said, 'Truly this was the Son of God.'"
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.600]   What we are witnessing here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.600]   In 2 Corinthians 5 verse 21 it says,
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.600]   "God made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.600]   so that we might become the righteousness of God in him."
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:36.600]   What we see on this way to the cross is Jesus in Isaiah 53 verse 4-7.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.600]   "Surely our griefs he himself bore and our sorrows he carried
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:48.600]   yet we ourselves esteemed him stricken, smitten of God, afflicted."
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:54.600]   "He was pierced through for our transgression. He was crushed for our iniquity.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:59.600]   The chastening for our well-being fell upon him and by his scourging we are healed.
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:03.600]   All of us like sheep have gone astray. Each of us has turned to his own way.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.600]   But the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on him.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.600]   He was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he did not open his mouth.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:15.600]   Like a lamb that is led to slaughter and like a sheep that is silent before its shearers
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.600]   so he did not open his mouth."
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.600]   So, on Good Friday when we think of Jesus walking to the cross,
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.600]   we have to remember what was happening.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:31.600]   That the only innocent one to walk the earth was marching with his crucifix to hang on a tree
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.600]   but she would not just die for her sins and just do whatever for like, "Oh, he forgives."
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:46.600]   He was taking upon himself the very sin of every person who had placed their faith in him.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.600]   Every single one of us will die in the flesh
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:55.600]   but we will, every single one of us, awaken to a spiritual reality before the judgment of God.
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:00.600]   And regardless of the opinions of every individual, this truthful and certain reality
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.600]   waits every single one of us that we will indeed kneel before the Creator
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.600]   and wrath is what each of us deserves.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:15.600]   And if you have not placed your faith in the only one who is able to take upon the full brunt
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.600]   of the wrath of God which is found on this Good Friday,
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.600]   you stand naked and exposed before God.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:30.600]   You have nothing to hide behind, no more place of grace, and it's coming.
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:36.600]   You have to mark my words here, it's coming for you.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:49.600]   But, if you place your faith in Him, at that place when you come before judgment
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:55.600]   and you're kneeling before the Creator and He is about to explode on you,
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:02.600]   if you place your faith in Christ, you will find a Savior who stands before you and God.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:08.600]   You will be literally staring up at the back of your Savior.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.600]   The one who took the full brunt of it.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:23.600]   The one who stood as a propitiation for your sin, to appease the fury and goodness and justice of God.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:29.600]   He will stand between you and God and He has taken every blow.
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:37.600]   Jesus willingly takes that for you if you place your faith in Him.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.600]   That's it.
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:47.600]   To conclude, let me read from Hebrews 2, verse 9.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.600]   "But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels, namely Jesus,
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.600]   because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor,
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:00.600]   so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone."
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.600]   Wow.
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:08.600]   "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things,
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:15.600]   in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:19.600]   For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father,
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:23.600]   for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren."
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:30.600]   Would you take a moment here to bow your heads with me?
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:34.600]   And on this Good Friday, make this personal.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:42.600]   If you're a believer, we need to again remember what He did on that cross.
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:47.600]   And experienced again the fullness of what happened there.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:52.600]   We need to stand in awe and gratitude.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.600]   If our hearts have been far, if our hearts have been cold,
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:04.600]   if the gospel has become stale, let's take this time tonight again to consider our Savior.
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:12.600]   This is also going to be a time where we partake in communion together.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:21.600]   And we can meditate and concentrate and think upon the blood that was shed for us,
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.600]   upon the body that was broken for us.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.600]   That we can now partake in Jesus Christ Himself.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:33.600]   Would you use this time to examine yourself
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:37.600]   and to meditate on the body of Christ broken for you
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.600]   and the blood of Christ shed for you.
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:45.600]   And this communion is a time for baptized believers, if you are to participate.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.600]   So please refrain from participating in it if you are not a baptized believer.
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.600]   And simply observe.
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.600]   But all of us now for the next few minutes, we will give you this opportunity
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.600]   to pray and to meditate and come before the Lord.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.600]   Think about what He's done.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:06.600]   After praying, I'll come back up and I'm going to read for us from 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.600]   And we'll take up the communion together so you can wait for further instruction there.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.600]   But for now, would you join me in prayer?

[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:21.120]   (gentle music continues)
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:24.880]   (gentle music continues)

[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:05.900]   (gentle music continues)
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:17.180]   It says in 1 Corinthians 11, verse 23,
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.480]   "For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:22.940]   to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:25.900]   in which he was betrayed, took bread.
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.360]   And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.680]   'This is my body, which is for you.
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.020]   Do this in remembrance of me.'
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:35.400]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.600]   saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:42.060]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:44.780]   For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:48.280]   you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.'"
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:50.680]   Can we take this together?
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:54.100]   (gentle music continues)
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:57.520]   (gentle music continues)
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:21.620]   Let's pray.
[01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:26.120]   (gentle music continues)
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:31.260]   Heavenly Father, this is for every believer
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:35.420]   because your sacrifice on that cross
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:39.080]   makes it so that we are now covered by your blood
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.880]   and made into the body of Christ.
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:45.920]   And we thank you, Lord, that we are given ability
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.920]   to come now before you to your throne of grace,
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:54.000]   that we are allowed entrance into the kingdom of God,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.800]   God, that we are called sons and daughters
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.800]   of the one true King,
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:00.720]   because you, Lord, the great, majestic,
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.180]   powerful creator God,
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:05.800]   would send your only son to come into the world
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.880]   to die on the cross for our sins.
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:10.680]   We are only but grateful to you tonight, Lord,
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.500]   on a night where there was not just a murder,
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.640]   but the full brunt of God's wrath poured out
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.920]   upon Jesus Christ,
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.680]   that we can celebrate because he took my place
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:21.880]   on that cross.
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.340]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:28.040]   Would you please stand with us again?
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:31.800]   (gentle music)
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:35.380]   I wanna read from Isaiah 53, 46.
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:40.840]   Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows,
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.080]   that we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted,
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.040]   that he was pierced for our transgressions,
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.720]   he was crushed for our iniquities.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:52.960]   Upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.920]   and with his wounds we are healed.
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:58.220]   All we like sheep have gone astray,
[01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:00.760]   we have turned, everyone, to his own way.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:05.840]   And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:05.660]   And so Lord, as we go home tonight,
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:07.660]   each one of us to their own way,
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:14.160]   Father, we pray that as we think about and meditate
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:20.660]   just deeply Lord, about what it cost the Son of God,
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:27.660]   who Lord was rich, but for our sake became poor.
[01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:33.660]   The one who knew no sin was not only accursed,
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:38.660]   but became sin that we might have life.
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:46.660]   Thank you Lord, for saving us,
