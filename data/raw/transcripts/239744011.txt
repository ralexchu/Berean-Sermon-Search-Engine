[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960]   As regards to the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake, but as regards to election,
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.220]   they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.240]   For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.320]   For just as you were at one time disobedient to God, but now have received mercy because
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.120]   of their disobedience, so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.680]   shown to you, they also may now receive mercy.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.960]   For God has consigned all to disobedience that he may have mercy on all.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.760]   Oh, the depth of riches in the wisdom and knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.960]   judgments and how inscrutable his ways.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.200]   For who has known the mind of the Lord or who has been his counselor or who has given
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.560]   a gift to him that he might be repaid?
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.920]   For from him and through him and to him are all things.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.520]   To him be glory forever.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.520]   Amen.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.520]   Let's pray.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.960]   Father, we thank you for the gathering of believers.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.000]   We thank you for the church that you have purchased through the blood of your son, Jesus.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.240]   I pray that you would help us to put away all distractions, that the time that we have
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.000]   together may be fixated on Christ, who he is and what he has done.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.240]   Help us, Lord God, to gain a glimpse of his glory, that we may be changed, that our burdens,
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.720]   Lord God, may be laid at the cross.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.760]   I pray you would bless this time.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.040]   You help us to be fruitful.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.520]   Help us to long for your presence, thirsting, Lord, for righteousness, that we may find
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.600]   satisfaction in him and him alone.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.640]   So we ask for your blessing and your guidance.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.640]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.640]   Amen.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.560]   As you guys know, we've been preaching and studying through the book of Romans for quite
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.560]   a while now.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.560]   And I probably, if there's any one book that I've really dedicated myself to get to know
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.480]   and familiar with, it's probably this book.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.680]   And I preached through it maybe about three times already in ministry.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.560]   I mean, from chapter one all the way to chapter 16.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.240]   We started it, probably there's more verses that I've memorized in this book than any
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.240]   other book.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.320]   So I can say I'm not a master of this book, but I can say that I probably dedicated more
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.560]   time in this book than any other book.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.160]   You know, one thing that was really interesting to me this time through is that, you know,
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.800]   typically when we think about the meat of the gospel or meat of the book of Romans,
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.480]   we usually think of chapter eight, right?
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.900]   Chapter eight of the book of Romans.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.800]   Or chapter one through eight is the presentation of the gospel, right?
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.440]   The first three chapters is about how all have sinned and fall short of the glory of
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.280]   God and it introduces us for need for Christ and what does it mean to be saved.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.520]   And then chapter eight, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.060]   And then that takes us to chapter nine through 11.
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.260]   And typically, even some of the commentaries, if you read the commentaries, it'll say chapter
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.260]   nine through 11.
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.080]   It's kind of a parenthetical, you know, chapters where he's been making an argument, he's made
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.400]   his point in chapter eight and that's kind of like the pinnacle of what Paul was trying
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   to say.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.080]   And then before he moves on to the imperatives in chapter 12, so therefore this is how you
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.840]   ought to live, he takes three chapters to explain why God is not done with Israel, which
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.800]   in essence, that's what he does.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.520]   He does take three chapters to explain to us where does Israel fit into all of this.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.400]   If God has opened the door to the kingdom of God to the Gentiles and all this time that
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.960]   the Jews believed that they were the kingdom, right, and then what does this mean?
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.960]   Well, this time going through it, I realized that chapter nine through 11 isn't parenthetical
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   at all.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.400]   It fits right in.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.280]   It fits right in with Paul's argument.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.120]   So what I realized with that chapter one through eight was the presentation of the gospel and
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.320]   to chapter nine through 11 is an illustration of that gospel.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.240]   It is the actual outworking of that gospel in the nation of Israel, what God has been
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.400]   doing through the Old Testament, New Testament, and what God will continue to do going forward.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.560]   So in actuality, he's not taking a break from his argument.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.320]   In reality, what he's doing is he's given the argument, full scope of the argument up
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.500]   to chapter eight, and then he actually illustrates it.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.240]   This is how it played out with the nation of Israel, and that serves as an example of
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.160]   how it will play out with the church, to the Gentile church.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.580]   So I don't know if you were able to follow it or not, but for me personally, chapter
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.620]   nine through 11 has been a huge blessing for me personally.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.520]   Just a tangible way that God has been working through the nation of Israel, what he has
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.440]   been doing, that even in the context of judgment, even in the context of the failure of the
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.780]   nation of Israel to see and to accept and believe their Messiah, that God's promise
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.200]   and his word is irrevocable, that what he says, he does.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.240]   And I don't know about you, but that sets a firm foundation in my faith in Christ, that
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.740]   we always say that it is not by our works, right?
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.160]   It's not by our works.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.820]   God doesn't measure us based upon our righteousness, but you see how that is being illustrated
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.600]   with the nation of Israel.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.120]   Well, the text that we're looking at this morning, this week and then next week, we're
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.480]   going to be summarizing Paul's argument that he's been making.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.800]   And so there's three parts to today's message and then we're going to be talking about the
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.120]   very last verse, verse 36 next week.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.960]   But basically what he's doing, he's summarizing the message of the cross in these verses.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.960]   There's going to be a huge transition that's going to take place from chapter 11 to chapter
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.960]   12.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.720]   So chapter 12, he's going to start going into the imperatives.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.200]   So he's given us the gospel.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.840]   This is how the gospel has been playing out in the history of Israel and how it will play
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.040]   out with the Gentile world.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:08.040]   And then chapter 12 to 16, he's going to say, "Therefore, this is what it means to you in
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.040]   your personal life."
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.200]   It's not Paul's whole intention wasn't just, "Well, I hope you understand what the gospel
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   is."
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.380]   It's like, "Well, okay, now we're better educated on who God is and what he has done."
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.520]   There's a point to all of this, at least practically.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.940]   And that is because of what he has done, because of who he is, "Therefore, live out your life
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.000]   and offer your body as a living sacrifice."
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.620]   And so that's going to be the main argument he's going to be making and challenge he's
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.240]   going to give us starting from chapter 12.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.760]   But before he does that, he concludes and wraps up his 11 chapters of presentation of
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.120]   the gospel.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.520]   And so again, what he has to say in these passages are rich.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.040]   So I hope if some of you guys had took some time to read it or at least wrestle through
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.720]   it, you'll hopefully get more out of it than if you didn't.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:01.240]   But either way, we're going to be looking at the three arguments that he's making here
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.920]   and basically in summary.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.520]   So we could probably spend the whole month or even more just talking about each one of
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.520]   these points.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.400]   But again, as Paul has already made these arguments and now he's giving it to us as
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.240]   a summary before he moves on.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.020]   So this morning, I want to look at three things that he gives, three qualities of the gospel
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.100]   that he gives, again, as a summary of what he's been saying up to this point.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.640]   So the number one, the first thing that he says, we find in verse 32 where he says, "For
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.040]   God has consigned all to disobedience that he may have mercy on all."
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:40.040]   He's made the argument up to this point that the Jews, because of their disobedience, that
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.780]   they have been hardened, but temporarily.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.760]   And as a result of their hardening, God allowed the Gentiles to come in.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.120]   And then he reminds the Gentiles that at one point you were hardened and God had mercy
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.760]   on you and he brought you to faith.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:03.440]   So in the end, God has consigned everyone, Jew and Gentile, to disobedience that God
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.900]   may have mercy on all.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.360]   So the first point that we want to see in this is the gospel is made manifest through
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.360]   the disobedience of mankind.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:21.720]   The first summary, the gospel is made manifest through the disobedience of mankind.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.480]   Before we move on, and I know if you were paying attention, a question that you should
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.520]   have, okay, so if you're sitting here right now with absolutely blank, kind of like, "Oh,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.720]   okay, that's, you know, he read what he read."
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:40.120]   But if you're paying attention, my guess is you should be asking, if God consigned people
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:47.080]   to disobedience, how can he keep, how can he bring judgment upon mankind if God's the
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.560]   one who consigned it?
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.640]   I mean, clearly he says he consigned them to disobedience, right?
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:01.760]   If he led them to disobedience, if he pushed them toward unfaithfulness, how can he come
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.920]   and say, "Now you are condemned"?
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.400]   That's probably what you should be asking.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.120]   If you're not asking that, you probably weren't paying attention, right?
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.680]   So in order to properly understand what he means by that, we need to really dissect what
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.680]   he means.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:21.080]   So the understanding of the word disobedience, the word disobedience in and of itself in
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.560]   Greek is apatheia.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.760]   That's the word that is translated in the ESV as disobedience.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.680]   What does that word apatheia sound like?
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.680]   Apathy.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.240]   And that's exactly what it means.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:43.560]   It means unwilling to be dissuaded, persuaded, meaning you have no feelings toward it, that
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:49.760]   you're going to hold your position and God is not moving you toward any direction.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.020]   You're refusing.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.800]   That's a literal understanding of this word disobedience.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.360]   Some of your translations probably have translated this word as unbelief.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.600]   Unbelief.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:08.720]   So unbelief and disobedience is translated the same way, from the same word.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:15.840]   In fact, so much of our rebellion against God, oftentimes in Scripture, is simply described
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.120]   as unbelief.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.400]   When Israel rebels against God, God looks at their rebellion and says, "They did not
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.760]   believe."
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.760]   Jesus uses it the same way.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.960]   In Matthew 6:30, he looks at the anxiousness over material goods.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.360]   He says to the crowd, "Do not be anxious about what you will eat or wear and that God's
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.960]   going to take good care of you."
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:45.640]   Basically, in that context, he says, "Do not have little faith."
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.960]   He equates anxiousness for the things of this world, temptation to go after them, as unbelief.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.320]   Matthew 8:26, when the disciples, when the storms came and they were fearful of their
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.560]   life, Jesus woke up and he said, "You have little faith."
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:06.640]   He accused them of unbelief, that the core of their fear came from not having enough
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.640]   faith.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.720]   Matthew 17:20, he said, "When the disciples came back and they had lack of power to be
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:17.440]   able to cast out the demons," he said, "it's because you have little faith."
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:24.640]   He described lack of power to be able to cast out demons as also connected to unbelief.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:32.520]   How at the core of everything that we do, he says, "It is a demonstration of our faith
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.440]   or lack of faith."
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.520]   So here in this passage, when he talks about disobedience, the very word that is translated
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:48.640]   here literally means unwilling to move, to be changed, or unbelief.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.360]   And that's how Israel's rebellion and the Gentile, when they resist God, ultimately
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.520]   is described as unbelief, because they refuse to believe that God is sovereign.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.720]   They refuse to believe the things that Christ has done.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.400]   They refuse to believe his resurrection.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.160]   They refuse to believe his death and burial.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.120]   And as a result of that, they live independently from God.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.160]   Now having said that, this is kind of a side point.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.160]   Whenever we think about Christian life and sanctification, our natural tendency is what
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.160]   are we doing wrong?
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.540]   What are we doing wrong?
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:27.160]   And there's nothing wrong with that question, because we need to examine ourselves.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   What are we doing?
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.440]   What are the decisions that are making that are kind of leading us to the wrong path?
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.060]   But even before we get to the question of what are we doing wrong, how do we fix the
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:41.760]   physical, we have to take a step back and ask ourselves, "Why am I not doing that?
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.700]   How did I get here?"
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.800]   Because if you look at the scripture, the target is always internal.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.320]   See, sin is not something that comes and lands on us.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.960]   Sin is something that comes out of us, he said.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.340]   Is what comes out of a man.
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.940]   So we take a step back and ask ourselves, "What is it do I not believe about God that
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.920]   is causing me to not believe that if I give myself to him that he's going to take care
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.920]   of me?"
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.360]   "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you."
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.160]   What is it about that do you not believe?
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.740]   That is causing you to be anxious that if I do give it to him, that maybe he's not going
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.820]   to offer it up.
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:25.640]   Maybe he's not going to answer my prayers.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.720]   So sanctification is not simply about you were doing the wrong thing and now you're
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.920]   doing the right thing.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.280]   Sanctification simply isn't about you didn't go to church and now you're going to church.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.640]   You didn't read your Bible so now you're reading your Bible.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.900]   Sanctification ultimately is initiated when we get a glimpse of the glory of the gospel
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.360]   of Jesus Christ and we are changed internally.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.960]   And then now that begins to change our behavior.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.420]   We worship God not because if we don't worship God, God's going to punish us.
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.860]   We worship God as a natural response.
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.500]   And so when you look at chapter 12, he says, "I appeal to you, brothers, by the mercies
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:10.100]   of God, in view of this mercy, in view of what God has done, in view of the glory of
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:15.440]   what you have seen," he said, "present your body as a living sacrifice."
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:22.380]   So the first question that we need to ask ourselves is do we have faith?
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.380]   Do we have faith?
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:29.340]   Because that's how Israel's rebellion and mankind's rebellion is described as unbelief,
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.980]   unwilling to be changed.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.900]   But what does it mean then if he's saying that their disobedience is ultimately unbelief,
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.860]   then what does it mean for God to consign it to them?
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.660]   Because it kind of sounds like God pushed them toward that.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.940]   How are they going to believe if God pushed them to unbelief?
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.860]   Well, this is one of those words that's really difficult to translate with one word.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.700]   So what I did was I listed all the different translations and all the different ways that
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.740]   each of the translations – did I put it up all together?
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.820]   Okay, there it is.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.700]   So NIV translate this as "bound all men to disobedience."
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.940]   NASB has it "shut up all in disobedience."
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.820]   New King James has "committed them all to disobedience."
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.300]   King James has "concluded them all to unbelief."
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.500]   The Living Translation, "given them all to sin."
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.060]   New RSV, "imprisoned all to disobedience."
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.660]   TEV, "made all people prisoners of disobedience."
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.460]   And here's the message.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:36.260]   This is the long version, the most, I guess, friendly, user-friendly.
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:41.020]   God makes sure that we all experience what it means to be outside so that he can personally
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.860]   open the door and welcome us back in.
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:48.220]   So the Message Bible, I'm assuming, is about this thick.
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.860]   But you can tell by the way that this word is translated in each one of these translations,
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:58.260]   every single one of them has used a different word.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.740]   And so collectively, all of this gives some idea.
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.740]   Not all of it.
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:09.980]   There's no one word that captures in totality the meaning of this particular word.
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.340]   So just to understand it consigned, you won't get the full understanding.
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.180]   So every single one of us.
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:20.020]   To bind men, to put them together, to shut up.
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:25.420]   And this is kind of the word, the idea of when you go fishing and then you cast a net
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.460]   and you catch it up, catch it all into a net.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.180]   That's the meaning behind that.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.100]   Committed them all to disobedience.
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.420]   Concluded the end result of their unbelief.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.460]   Given them all up.
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.540]   Let it run its course.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:49.340]   Imprisoned because of their disobedience that they were given the just penalty for their
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.980]   disobedience.
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.900]   They were made sinners.
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:17:02.800]   So the idea of the word consigned isn't God took these innocent people and then he began
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.540]   to influence them toward unbelief.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.440]   That is not the idea that is taught here.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:16.180]   In fact, in Galatians chapter 322, this word, this exact word is used to describe how the
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.060]   scriptures led people to sin.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:23.540]   Galatians 322, it says, "But the scripture imprisoned everyone, everything under sin,
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:30.060]   so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.780]   Clearly he's not saying that scripture forced you to sin.
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.680]   That's not what he means here.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.940]   He's not saying that scripture imprisoned everything under sin.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.980]   It's not somebody who was righteous read the scriptures and the scriptures incited you
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.500]   to sin.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.380]   That's clearly not what he is saying here.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:52.020]   What he is saying, and I think Barnes makes a good note, and I think there's a quote of
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.780]   Barnes that I think I gave.
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.780]   The next one.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:04.100]   Barnes says in describing this, "The keeper of a prison does no wrong in confining a criminal
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:09.300]   or the judge in condemning him or the executioner in fulfilling the sentence of the law.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.900]   So of God."
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:17.260]   What he does is not to compel people to remain under unbelief, but to declare that they are
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.260]   so.
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.580]   So his quote is up there.
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:28.620]   "All this to say what Paul has already said.
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:35.900]   All of this to say what Paul has already said, that he allowed sin to become orderly sinful
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.940]   before he presented a way out.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:47.880]   He allows the hardening of the heart to take his full course, to not only dabble in sin,
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:55.900]   but to be bound in sin before they are able to recognize their dire need for Christ.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.820]   The greatest problem with the nation of Israel when Christ came was that they did not see
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:07.700]   the need for a Savior to be crucified for their sins.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:14.900]   The greatest problem that we have today in our culture in having a very superficial response
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:21.280]   to the cross is that though we raise our hands and walk down the aisle, that because the
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:29.540]   effect of what Christ has done for us hits us superficially.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:35.680]   We do not act like men and women who have been saved from hell.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:42.020]   We do not act and respond and worship a God who saved us, who are utterly hopeless, dead
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:49.220]   in our trespasses, weighed down by our sin, who are desperate and cried out to God.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.140]   Many people in the church have simply made a choice.
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.380]   I didn't know Christ.
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.380]   I'd rather have Christ.
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.940]   I wanted to give him a chance, so I came to church.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.340]   I read the scriptures because my small group accountability partner told me this is what
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.460]   I should do.
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:09.100]   I committed to the church because I want to belong to the body of Christ and I want
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.540]   to have good friends to run this race with.
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:21.940]   But at the core of who we are are sinners who have been saved from our sins.
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:28.180]   So what unites us is not our hair, it's not our language, it is not our common experience.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:36.380]   What unites us is every single one of us who are dead in our trespasses, Christ saved.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:42.540]   So there is a sense of desperateness that everyone was in before we met Christ.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.440]   That's what unites us together.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:52.340]   If you've ever been in a situation of an emergency, whether it was with your family or a group
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.420]   of friends, there's a camaraderie that is created.
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:04.100]   So I don't know if you've ever met military people who just came back from war.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:08.060]   They have a lot of problems, PTSD or whatever, they have all these struggles.
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:13.780]   And I have a few friends who were deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq during the last 10,
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.420]   15 years, and some of them two to three times, and they've seen some horrendous stuff.
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:23.700]   They've seen friends with their legs blown off and partners that drive it in the car
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.580]   and the car would blow up or they get shot and he would die, but he didn't.
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:34.100]   And I remember having a conversation with a young man who came back from war, and he
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.860]   said in the beginning of the war, he would walk in down and his friends would get shot.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.460]   And in the beginning, he said he was having such a hard time, you know, digesting all
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.860]   of this, what do I do with this?
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.620]   But the only way for him to survive is to just keep going.
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.940]   So he said he got numb to it.
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.460]   He got numb to his friends dying.
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:57.660]   And then he said when they came back, he said he had a hard time adjusting to that.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.060]   But they would cling to each other.
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:07.300]   It created this, because they survived this horrendous war, it created this fellowship
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:13.380]   among them, whether they were Asian or Caucasian or whether they were Hispanic, whatever background
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:18.940]   they came from, the fact that every single one of them was saved from this horrendous
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:23.420]   experience that they can't relate to us.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:28.460]   They can share with me and I can sympathize with them, but it's not the same.
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.940]   And they would get together with their buddies and they would share and they don't have to
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.380]   say a word, they understand the experience that they had.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:43.740]   See, real fellowship in the church happens when a gathering of people who recognize what
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:51.100]   they have been saved from, and they see the value of who Jesus is.
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:56.400]   And it creates this camaraderie in the church, not superficially because we're same age or
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:02.420]   same background or same experience, but because we were saved by the same blood of Christ
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.100]   and we have the same Father.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:10.460]   See that's what Paul means, he said consigned all to disobedience, because until they recognize
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:16.260]   their sin as utterly sinful, they do not cling to Christ with all their might.
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.420]   How much of our superficial fellowship in the church is because we have a superficial
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.360]   affection for Christ?
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:28.580]   How much of our superficial desire to share the gospel is because we don't see the desperate
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.420]   need for the gospel in the world?
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.700]   That's what he means when he says he consigned all to disobedience, to unbelief.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:41.260]   He allowed it to take its full course so that he can turn on the light in the darkness,
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:47.420]   so that the men and women who are saved by this would recognize that they were in dire
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.120]   need of a Savior.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:56.420]   So the first thing that he says in summary, the gospel is made manifest through the disobedience
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:08.300]   of mankind, how God uses our weakness and sometimes even rebellion to fulfill his promise.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:13.300]   In fact what's interesting to me is from the very get-go of the gospel, God always uses
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:19.860]   the closing of one door, rejection and hostility of one people to open the door to another.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:25.460]   Salvation came to the world because his own people rejected him and crucified him on the
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.660]   cross.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.580]   Mission in the early church happened because of persecution in Jerusalem.
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:35.180]   They were running for their lives and then as they were running back home and running
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.220]   away from Jerusalem, they began to share the gospel.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.860]   The gospel came to the Gentiles because Paul went to the synagogue and began to preach
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:46.660]   and they shut the door on him so he went to the marketplace and so the gospel began to
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.340]   go to the Gentiles.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:52.860]   Paul wanted to go to Rome and ultimately to Spain and because he was imprisoned, he had
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:57.260]   to start writing letters and he started making disciples in prison and as a result of that,
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:02.300]   the gospel began to spread all over and now we have these prison epistles.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:08.980]   That every single instance where it seemed like the gospel was facing resistance, God
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.540]   had greater plans.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:17.580]   That even in the rejection of his gospel, God is allowing hardness to take its full
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.020]   course because God has greater plans.
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.740]   He is a sovereign God.
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:28.460]   In fact, today and I'm sure maybe even 10 years ago, this persecution in the Middle
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:33.580]   East, in fact, a lot of people refuse to travel to the Middle East, especially Christians
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:39.620]   because of all the things that we're hearing about the persecution, the bombing of churches,
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.500]   beheading, horrendous stuff that's happening.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.180]   But along with that, if you've been reading carefully about what's happening in the Middle
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.340]   East, there's a revival breaking out, the gospel.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.900]   They said there's more mass conversions that are taking place in the Middle East because
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:58.040]   of these persecutions than they've ever seen in modern history.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:06.180]   That in every instance where we see resistance, we see the light going even stronger through
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.780]   another door.
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.560]   God is absolutely sovereign.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:19.580]   That even while the Jews were rejecting Christ, God was using that to bring the gospel to
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:26.180]   the Gentiles and He's reminding the Gentiles that one day that though they are hardened,
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.500]   God will use their hardening to open their eyes to see the need for this revival and
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.020]   God will ultimately bring them back again.
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:37.940]   The gospel is made manifest through the disobedience of mankind.
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:43.320]   Secondly, the gospel is the revelation of the depth of the riches of wisdom and knowledge
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.620]   of God ultimately.
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:52.800]   The first one teaches us that God is completely sovereign, that God allows disobedience and
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:58.140]   unfaithfulness and unbelief to take its course, that sin may become utterly sinful and that
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:03.620]   man may need, may come to an understanding that we're desperately in need of Christ.
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.180]   But second part of the gospel, again, all of this is a summary of what Paul has already
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:13.340]   been saying, that the gospel, the purpose of the gospel is to reveal the depth of his
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:18.100]   riches, his wisdom, and his knowledge.
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.500]   In our text, it begins by saying, "Oh."
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:28.020]   Oh, I don't know if any of you use that word, like, "Oh, take a look at…"
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.380]   We just use it in literature, we may see it, but that's an actual word.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:36.980]   That's an actual word in Greek and basically it means to pay attention.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.660]   It's basically an exclamation mark, right?
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.540]   So maybe the way we would write it today is, "Pay attention," or "Look here."
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.740]   But in the Greek, it basically causes us to stop and say, "Look at this," right?
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:56.540]   We've seen that in other parts of the scripture when Paul says earlier, he says, "Look,
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.220]   consider," right?
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.180]   Consider his kindness and his severity.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.460]   That is important for us to recognize that God is holy and he is mercy, that these two
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.120]   things go hand in hand.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.740]   So now he's also saying, "Oh, look at this."
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:13.600]   Take a close look at the depth of the riches of his wisdom and knowledge.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.040]   Because the whole purpose of the gospel, the revelation of everything that he has done
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:23.300]   and who he is, was to reveal to the world who he is.
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.400]   When Jesus was going to the cross, he says, "I'm now going to," what?
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.120]   "To glorify the Father, and the Father is going to glorify the Son."
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.480]   To glorify something is to take something that is there and put it on a pedestal so
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.840]   that the whole world could see.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.240]   That's what I mean to glorify something.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.940]   That's the way we use that language.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:45.080]   So when Jesus went to the cross, he says, "Now, what may have been hidden, what may
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:50.640]   have not been clear, if they didn't get the glory of God," he said, "He's going to go
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:58.560]   to the cross so that the world can see, so that the world can see who he is."
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.120]   So before we even think about what he has done for us and how it affects us, first and
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:10.760]   foremost, the gospel is a glorification of the rich and the depth of his riches, his
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.100]   wisdom and his knowledge.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.800]   We see Christ.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.800]   We see God.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:20.400]   We see the Holy Spirit in his maximum display at the cross.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.420]   You want to understand God's holiness?
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.300]   Look at the cross.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.720]   You want to understand his mercy and his grace?
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.140]   Look at the cross.
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.920]   You want to understand his nature?
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.720]   Look at the cross.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.760]   You want to understand his patience?
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.920]   Look at the cross.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.240]   You want to understand his hatred towards sin?
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.640]   Look at the cross.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.080]   You want to understand his patience towards sinners?
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.040]   Look at the cross.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:52.080]   The cross is the display of the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of our Savior.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:30:00.100]   First and foremost, the scripture describes the fall of mankind as being blind, being
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.320]   blinded to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.640]   It's because the world does not see who he is.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.240]   That's why they don't worship him.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.060]   That's why there is even a temptation.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:17.680]   That's why we're even tempted, even as Christians.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:23.960]   You're not going to win temptation of this world by being disciplined because there's
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.520]   just too many good things out there.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.760]   There's just too many good things out there.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:34.600]   I mean, who doesn't want to live in a nice, comfortable house?
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.680]   Who doesn't want to live on a nice bed?
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.840]   Who doesn't want to have more money?
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.960]   Who doesn't want to travel the world?
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:47.120]   I mean, naturally, that's the inclination and temptation of everybody.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:52.980]   I mean, the reason why pornography is such a big issue is because it's not calculated.
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.920]   You don't sit there and think, "Oh, I think this is good for me."
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.360]   I don't know anybody who wrestles with that actually thought it out.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.320]   You're just giving into the temptation of your flesh.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.200]   You desire it, you want it, and you give into it.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.280]   We don't conquer temptation by being more disciplined.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:19.120]   Temptation is conquered when there is a greater affection for something else that conquers
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.480]   that temptation.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:27.960]   The whole point of Him revealing His glory is to say, "Don't go there, come here."
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.720]   It's not like, "Oh, you know, I'm just a righteous, good person, so I'm going to resist
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.880]   myself from doing bad, and I'm going to do what is right and do this."
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.720]   The whole reason why Christ came was because we couldn't do that.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:46.760]   You and I did not have the ability to say one day, "I'd rather be a good person," and
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.800]   then chose to be a good person.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.640]   That's not how sanctification happens either.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:32:00.900]   Sanctification happens when we see and treasure Christ above all the other temptations.
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:05.440]   When Christ is better than what you are tempted by.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.920]   When He is what you desire more than anything else that is tempting you.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:16.480]   And so, sanctification ultimately is selfish.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.840]   Sanctification ultimately is not at the core noble.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.840]   Ultimately sanctification and pursuit of holiness is selfish, is when we recognize Christ above
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.920]   everything else.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:35.360]   The gospel ultimately is a revelation of His riches, of His depth.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:42.520]   See, an individual, no matter how he confesses that Jesus saved him, you can tell if there
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.120]   is an affection for Christ.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:51.400]   Whether somebody is just doing the minimum to get by.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.840]   Whether they're just checking in and checking out.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.520]   You can tell.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.680]   You can tell in the fellowship.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.400]   You can tell in the way that they do Bible study.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.440]   You can tell in the way that they serve people, share the gospel, that they're just checking
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.440]   in and checking out.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.960]   Every Sunday they check in and check out.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.200]   They sing the songs, they open their mouth, but it's not real worship.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.520]   There's a huge difference between somebody who is worshiping God in view of the mercy
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.040]   that He has shown them.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.320]   Because they're so enamored by the cross.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.740]   I can't begin to fathom why He did this to me.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.660]   Why He chose me.
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.520]   And this mystery is causing Him to come to Christ and give worship to Him.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.360]   Versus, "I'm a Christian.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.360]   I should be doing this.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.440]   I shouldn't be doing this."
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:40.600]   See Romans chapter 9, 22-23, he says, "What if God, desiring to show His wrath and to
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.480]   make known His power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:52.440]   in order to make known the riches of His glory for vessels of mercy, which He has prepared
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.520]   beforehand for glory."
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:34:02.720]   In other words, He did all that He did in order to demonstrate the richness of His mercy
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.640]   toward us.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:11.720]   Paul describes his own ministry as declaring God's glory, Colossians 1-2, 1-3, "For I
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:15.360]   want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those that lay hold of this
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:20.040]   here and all those who have not seen me face to face, that their hearts may be encouraged,
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:24.880]   being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of the full assurance of understanding
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.240]   and the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:36.480]   That all of who God is, all of the richness about who He is and His knowledge contained
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:44.360]   in Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.600]   Everything that we treasure, everything that we are seeking for, he says, is found in Christ.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.600]   And that's what the cross was.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.960]   And that's how Paul describes his ministry.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.220]   He doesn't simply describe his ministry as getting sinners to repent.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:02.360]   He doesn't simply describe his ministry as people who didn't go to church to get to come
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.280]   to church and to read the Bible.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:10.100]   He says, "So that they may come to a full understanding of the richness that is found
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.400]   in Christ."
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:20.000]   That's what the gospel ultimately is, is a display of God's glory.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.120]   Again in Ephesians 3, 8-10, Paul says, "To me, though I am the very least of all the
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:32.080]   saints, this grace was given to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.640]   and to bring to light everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God,
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:42.400]   who created all things, so that through the church the manifold, the various wisdom of
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:49.200]   God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in heavenly places."
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.800]   Think about how much of the rhetoric and talk today, whether you are for Trump or against
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:58.080]   Trump and whatever we think the answer is.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.920]   Everybody who comes into politics says, "Well, they have better wisdom than the other party."
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:10.480]   Whether you're a Democrat or Independent or Republican or Libertarian, whatever you may
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:15.160]   be, every politician comes and says, "They have the wisdom that the other party does
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.840]   not have."
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.840]   That they have the answer.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.440]   If we tweak this and if we tweak that, and I'm sure it will have some effect, but ultimately
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:27.240]   the problem of mankind isn't politics.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:33.320]   Ultimately the problem with mankind isn't what we can or cannot say or how much money
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.360]   we have in our bank account.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:41.880]   Ultimately the problem of mankind is we have been separated from the author of life.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:49.200]   Everything that we are doing outside of Christ is trying to imitate fake life.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.800]   We're trying to gain it through politics, through money, through pleasure, through traveling,
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   whatever it may be.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:37:00.920]   What Paul is declaring is what you are searching for is in Christ.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:05.440]   What you are searching for, you may not be aware of it, but is in Christ.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.760]   The riches are in Christ.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.120]   The wisdom is in Christ.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.320]   His knowledge is in Christ.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:18.360]   So he describes his whole ministry as declaring the glory of Christ.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:24.400]   Third and finally, the gospel is ultimately a mystery.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.360]   The gospel is ultimately a mystery.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:31.760]   He says how unsearchable are his judgments, how inscrutable his ways.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.360]   How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.700]   For who has known the mind of the Lord and who has been his counselor or who has given
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:45.760]   a gift to him that he might be repaid?
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:51.440]   There is a huge difference between asking question and questioning.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.280]   If you've ever tried to evangelize to somebody and you're having a conversation with them
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:01.840]   and the way that they're asking questions, you could tell whether they are open or whether
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.040]   they are just poking holes.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:10.960]   And I've had so many conversations with people, like sometimes for hours and hours and hours,
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.400]   and it would lead to nothing.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.000]   Even if I make a good point, they refuse to acknowledge it and they try to come up with,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.760]   "Well, that," and then they'll go and do some more research and come back.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.760]   And they're not necessarily searching.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.760]   They're trying to prove their point, why they're right.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:29.000]   So even if they don't have a good answer, they'll say, "Okay, you know, I don't have
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.760]   an answer, but I will have one for you."
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.240]   And if they don't have one, they don't want to talk to you.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.600]   So they're not necessarily really searching.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.680]   There's a huge difference between asking questions versus questioning.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.540]   If you're raising kids, there's a huge difference.
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:50.800]   When they're young kids, right, they'll ask a lot of questions and they'll test your patience,
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.160]   but they'll ask a lot of questions.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.680]   Like, "Where are we going?"
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.720]   You know, "We're going here."
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.320]   Like, "Why?"
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.480]   "Oh, because we have to go."
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.440]   It's like, "Why?"
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.440]   And "Because we have this."
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.440]   "Why?"
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.440]   "Why are we eating this?"
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.440]   "We're having spaghetti."
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.440]   "Why?"
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.440]   "Because it's good for you."
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.920]   You know?
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:13.920]   But it's not hard to be patient with little kids because they're genuinely curious.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.880]   Like, "Why are we doing this?
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:16.880]   What is this?"
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:17.880]   And they'll have a thousand questions.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:23.560]   And then when they become teenagers, the "whys" become "why."
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.880]   It turns from asking questions to questioning.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.160]   Why do you do that?
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.480]   Why do we do this?
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.140]   Why do I have to do that?
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.760]   Why do I have to wake up in the morning?
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.760]   Why?
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.320]   Because we're asking the same questions, but there's a huge difference between asking
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.360]   questions versus questioning.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:48.560]   See, a questioning, you've already determined, and you're trying to convince the other person.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.880]   Where you're asking questions, you're genuinely curious, and you're trying to learn.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.680]   See, the Scripture tells us that the gospel is a mystery.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:00.320]   But it is not a mystery that God has hidden and said, "Well, you can't find."
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:05.360]   It is a mystery that God desires us to look into, and we could be asking questions and
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.640]   searching for the rest of eternity, and more will be revealed to us, but we will never
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.480]   exhaust His wisdom.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.400]   We will never exhaust His glory.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:21.880]   It's almost as if God kept it a mystery so that all of eternity, that there will be something
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:28.280]   new that will be revealed to us, that would all us, as it was from the very first day
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.760]   that we met Christ.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:38.040]   If we recognize the mystery of the gospel, and we continue to pursue Him just as we did
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.560]   when we first met Him, for the rest of eternity.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.640]   You know, whenever I meet a Christian, I say, "Oh, I've already studied that.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.040]   I already know that."
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.400]   You already know that there's something wrong in their relationship with God.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.760]   You already understand that just the shallowness, that they're just kind of like, "I get it.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   I get it now.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.400]   Like, oh, God is holy.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.840]   I get it."
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.120]   He is merciful.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.120]   I get it.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:07.800]   Like, can we move on to something more meaty, like dispensationalism, or covenant theology,
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.680]   or hypostatic union of Christ?
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.680]   Something meaty.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.560]   But holiness, I get it.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.960]   You know, so every once in a while, we're going to study Ephesians.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.880]   It's like, "Oh, I studied that."
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.560]   You know, oh, Revelation.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:23.400]   Oh, I took a class on that.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:28.760]   The scripture tells us the gospel itself is a mystery.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:33.640]   Mystery not hidden, where He doesn't want to reveal to us, is a mystery that causes
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:42.800]   us to seek, to ask, to learn, to grow, and to be amazed for eternity.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:47.400]   And I think many of you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.480]   Whether you've been a Christian, or whether you're a brand new Christian, or you've been
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:58.480]   Christian for 40, 50 years, the more you gaze upon the cross, the more amazing it is.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.940]   And I remember, you know, I would always be given, it's like, "Well, the cross, the love
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.960]   of Christ is kind of like the mother's love for the son, and you know, there's nothing
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:06.960]   like it."
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.800]   And so I've always kind of like, "Well, that's what it's like."
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   Right?
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:14.440]   It is closer than any other love that I know, but the more I gaze upon the cross, there's
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.480]   nothing like it.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.560]   Even the mother's love falls far short.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.440]   Falls far short.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.920]   You know, as a father, I can honestly confess to you.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:34.080]   I love my kids more than anything else, but it's nothing like God's love for me.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:39.780]   As much as I love my kids, as much as I think I know what's best for them, it is nothing
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:43.160]   like God's love.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.720]   We have a hard time even understanding our own heart.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:49.280]   In Jeremiah 17, 9, it says, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.280]   sick."
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.880]   Who can understand it?
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.960]   We don't even understand our own heart, let alone understand His.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.040]   To come before God questioning, like, "Why did He do this?
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.400]   Why did He do that?"
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:09.080]   And then we say, "I believe this, but I don't believe that, because this makes sense to
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.080]   me, and that doesn't."
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:13.640]   You don't even understand your own heart.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:18.240]   And though you married men, you don't even understand your wife.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.240]   You don't even understand your own husband.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.600]   I mean, that's why we get into struggles and fights and arguments, because I don't understand
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.200]   what you're saying.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.720]   I don't understand my kids sometimes.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.200]   And we try so hard to communicate with each other.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:38.520]   How can we possibly come in judgment of a God when we don't even understand ourselves?
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:44.480]   In Isaiah 55, 8 through 11, it says, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.720]   are your ways my ways," declares the Lord.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:51.680]   "For as the heavens are higher than earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.840]   my thoughts than your thoughts.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.640]   For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there, but water
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:02.880]   the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.980]   eater, so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth.
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.840]   It shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose and shall
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.120]   succeed in the thing for which I sent it."
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:20.600]   See, the whole point that he was trying to make in Isaiah, so when we recognize that
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.320]   his thoughts are higher than our thoughts, he's immediately pointing to his word.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:29.840]   There are certain things that you may not understand, but God has ordained it.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.240]   He has ordained it for a greater purpose.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.880]   See, let me read a couple more passages with you, and then I'm going to conclude for this
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.880]   morning.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:44.940]   Psalm 139, 1 through 6 says, "O Lord, you have searched me and you know me.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.880]   You know when I sit down and when I rise up.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.680]   You discern my thoughts from afar.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:54.680]   You search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:59.280]   Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know it altogether.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.720]   For you have me in behind and before and lay your hand upon me.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.600]   Such knowledge is too wonderful for me.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:06.800]   It is high.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.780]   I cannot attain it."
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.320]   We don't understand ourselves.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.120]   Sometimes your husband, your wife may not understand you.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.160]   Your parents may not understand you.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:22.780]   Your friends may not understand you, but a sovereign God who created you knows your inner
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:33.560]   being, and that God chose to get off his throne and pursue us, to love us, to point us to
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:39.880]   the cross, and then told us, "If you want to live, deny your flesh.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.100]   Deny the life that you think you can live in this world.
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:47.600]   Pick up your cross and follow me."
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.640]   Sometimes it may not make sense to you.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.280]   Sometimes the balance sheet may not come out right.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.800]   Sometimes there are certain things that may be happening in your life that you can't really
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.800]   put together, and you have a hard time letting go.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:08.980]   But the God who created you, who knows every part of you, who loves you more than any other
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:13.920]   living creature in this world, said to come.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:17.580]   Ultimately, that's the gospel.
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:23.080]   He says, "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.760]   I will be found by you," declares the Lord.
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:32.080]   Isn't our life found in Christ?
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:37.000]   Then shouldn't he be the one that we are seeking with all our might?
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.800]   That's the gospel.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:44.840]   The gospel isn't just, "He finished it, and now just wait to go to heaven."
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:52.400]   He declared his glory so that when we see his glory, that for the rest of eternity,
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:57.720]   not just in this life, but for the rest of eternity, that we would come.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.120]   Why?
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.580]   Why did you do this for me?
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:05.420]   The more you recognize your sin, you ask, "Why?
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:08.200]   Why are you so patient with me?"
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.600]   The more you fail, "Why?
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.360]   Why would you not cut me off?
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.180]   Why did you send your only begotten Son?
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:19.440]   Why did you prepare a place for me in eternity?
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:23.600]   Why would you let your Son suffer for sinners like me?
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.440]   Why would you be so patient with me?"
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:32.200]   And for the rest of eternity, to seek him with all your heart, because he promised he
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.240]   will be found if you seek him.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:42.240]   If I can ask, again, the praise team to come, take some time to pray.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:47.360]   You know the difference between checking in and checking out versus meeting Christ.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.540]   You know the difference.
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:54.440]   You know the difference in yourself, and you can see the difference in other people.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:48:00.200]   Church is a miserable place to be if this is just checking in and checking out.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.720]   You're hard-earned money.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:05.080]   I mean, it's hard to let go.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.120]   I mean, how many people love paying taxes?
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.920]   It's like paying taxes.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.520]   If it's not an act of worship, it's like paying taxes.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:19.360]   Like, "I worked so hard and over time, and I got to give this money," if it's not an
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.040]   act of worship.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.080]   Fellowship is miserable.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:29.440]   There's reasons why so much, like very few people talk to their neighbors, because it's
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.440]   a burden.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.200]   You don't know what these people are like.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.200]   You don't know what they're going to say, or you don't know.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.200]   It's a burden.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:44.760]   I mean, coming to the church, and then you have to love your neighbors as yourself.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:50.640]   Fellowship in the church is miserable if it is just checking in and checking out.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:54.000]   Serving the church, I mean, you work hard enough as it is, and then you come to church,
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   you got to serve other people, make food, and clean up, and set up chairs.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.160]   You went to college, so you didn't have to do that, right?
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:09.940]   If it is not an act of worship, it's night and day.
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:15.660]   For those people who have seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and because we've
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:21.200]   seen the depth of the riches of His wisdom and knowledge, and because we can't begin
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:29.040]   to fathom what He has done, a gathering of people who have been saved from their sins,
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:37.480]   pursuing together to glorify Christ, is what we are seeking, what we are after.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:41.080]   So let's take some time as we come before the Lord in prayer.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:45.360]   And every single one of us, I know that we struggle in different ways, but let's take
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.640]   this time to come before the Lord.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:52.120]   Once you've drifted away from Christ in your heart, make that the primary priority in everything
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.120]   that we pursue.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:56.960]   So let's do that first as our worship team leads us.
