[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.200]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 13.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.000]   This is going to be the second to the last sermon that we're going to be in the book
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.280]   of Hebrews.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.280]   Somebody clap.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:26.200]   I don't know what to make of that.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.960]   So it's going to be the second to the last sermon.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.880]   Actually when I'm about to finish, I kind of have a good idea of where I'm going to
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.720]   be jumping into.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.320]   And I still am not decided.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.920]   I kind of dwindled it down to two possibly areas that I might be focused on.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.840]   One is maybe go through the minor prophets or to my jump into the gospel of Luke.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.840]   So one or the other.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.560]   So if you, those of you who are studious who've been asking me where are we going, you can
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.960]   study both.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.960]   Okay.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.800]   And then so when we jump into that, you'll kind of get a headstart.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.560]   But Hebrews chapter 13, and I'll be reading verse 20 and 21.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.560]   Now the God of peace who brought up from the dead, the great shepherd of the sheep through
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.760]   the blood of the eternal covenant, even Jesus, our Lord equip you in every good thing to
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.960]   do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ, to whom
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.960]   be the glory forever and ever.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.960]   Amen.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.960]   Let's pray.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.040]   Heavenly father, we praise you and thank you that we have the privilege to be able
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:39.000]   to call you our Abba father, that we have hope that is eternal, that will never fade,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.280]   never perish kept for us, Lord God, by the power of Christ.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.120]   We thank you that we're able to pray and come to the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.080]   We thank you, father God, for brothers and sisters that we can run this race with.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.280]   We thank you that despite all that is happening around us, that you are our peace, that you
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.480]   are our joy, you are our life.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.480]   Help us, Lord God, to continue to focus our attention upon Christ, the author and perfecter
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480]   of our faith.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.480]   In Jesus name we pray.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.000]   Amen.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I want you to imagine for a minute what kind of letter you would write to our Ukrainian
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.600]   brothers, particularly to their church.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.280]   And I kind of want to give you a, you know, just to give you more information on how to
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.240]   approach it, how to think about it.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.760]   Imagine if the Ukrainian situation right now, with all that's going on, there's a lot of
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.600]   attention given, there's funds going, and so the church has been ignited.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.520]   And we're hearing a lot of encouraging things that are going on over there.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.760]   Let's imagine for a minute that the Russian government does come in and they take over
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.600]   and make it into a communist country, and they make it illegal to gather as a church.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.000]   And let's imagine for a minute that this has been going on now for about 20 to 30 years.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.480]   So at the beginning of all of this, there was a lot of excitement.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.120]   There's a lot of like igniting of the church, like this is what God is doing, and a lot
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.760]   of great work and evangelism that's taking place, but 20, 30 years have gone by, and
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.800]   now some of the leaders in the church have been jailed.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.360]   Some of them are actually starting to get publicly executed.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   And so the church is beginning to kind of slide back, to kind of synchrotize and stay
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.260]   undercover, and they're no longer actively evangelizing.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.440]   And so they're starting to realize that there are serious consequences and that that struggle
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.880]   is not momentary, that this may be a permanent thing that they need to accept.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:08.680]   And so in a large part, the church begins to drift back and start to compromise.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.080]   What kind of letter would you write to that church to encourage them, to get them back
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.920]   on track?
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.360]   I give that scenario to you because that's the historical background behind why this
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.700]   letter was being written.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.640]   It says that this was a church that was ignited in the beginning, and they were excited even
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.480]   in the persecution as their brothers and sisters are being dragged into jail.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.220]   They were visiting them joyfully, even as their possessions are being confiscated.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:43.920]   But the struggle is 10, 20, 30 years have gone by, and it wasn't letting up.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.340]   It started actually increasing, and the people who are leading them and inspiring them are
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.920]   starting to one by one starting to die.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.700]   And so the author of this letter is writing this letter to encourage them from drifting
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.960]   back to their old life.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.320]   And so the whole letter is written to kind of get them to refocus and re-anchor in Christ.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.920]   So the author spends majority of this letter reminding them who Jesus is.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.200]   So if there's one letter in the New Testament that you want to know about Jesus, about Christology,
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.520]   I'm not talking about the life of Jesus, the gospels, but the doctrine of Jesus and what
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.860]   he has done, it's the book of Hebrews.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.480]   And the whole reason behind that is not simply so that the recipients of this letter will
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   come out and say, "You know what?
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.880]   I know Christology now.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.440]   If you ask me anything about Jesus and the sacrifices and the covenants, I can tell you
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.120]   because I studied the book of Hebrews."
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.000]   The purpose of this letter is very practical.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.060]   It's written to a church who's drifting back and began to compromise certain things and
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.060]   accept certain things that they shouldn't.
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.400]   And so we talked about this last time I was up here, and there's a reason why he's concluding
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.940]   this letter by reminding them who God is.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.280]   He says in verse 20, "Now the God of peace."
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.240]   He could have emphasized all kinds of different aspects of who Jesus is and who God is.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.720]   He says, "God is the God of peace."
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.280]   There's a reason why he's saying that.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.440]   He didn't just pick of all the attributes that he just picked that one.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.720]   He's telling them that because their peace has been disturbed.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.840]   It's because they're looking for peace.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.760]   And the reason why they're drifting back into their old life is because they think that
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.880]   if they compromise a little bit, if they began to embrace their old life, the persecutors,
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.280]   the Jewish community, if they began to just begin to accept some of that, that maybe they
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.480]   could maintain some of that peace.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.760]   And that's why in conclusion to this letter, and he says he's reminding them, God is the
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.840]   God of peace.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.840]   He's the peace.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.360]   He's giving all the peace that this world can give.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.880]   But just like Jesus said in John 14, 27, "Peace I leave with you.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.880]   My peace I give to you.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.520]   Not as the world gives do I give to you.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.760]   Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor let it be fearful."
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:08.120]   That passage in John chapter 14 is also written to disciples who is about to lose their peace,
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.120]   worldly peace.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.800]   Jesus is about to go to the cross.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.680]   As long as they were following Jesus, they were walking with him with this great hope
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.040]   that the new kingdom was going to come and that they were going to be soldiers for this
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.040]   new Messiah.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.680]   And so they were constantly wrestling who's going to sit to the left or to the right.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.960]   But right before he wrote John chapter 14, he told them, "Where I go, you cannot come."
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.480]   And so they were beginning to get anxious.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.360]   They were losing their peace.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.040]   Because soon after he says that, he's going to go to the cross and they're going to be
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.480]   confused.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.800]   And so he's preparing them for that.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.120]   So he wasn't just randomly saying these things and say, "This is who I am."
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.320]   It's a very practical application.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.000]   He said, "I'm going to give you this peace."
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.120]   When everything around you begins to fall apart, I want you to remember that the peace
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.400]   that I give you is unlike any other peace.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.080]   That even if all the world power, even if all the world ends and the whole world begins
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.600]   to hold hands and we have utopia, he said, "The peace that I give to you is not a peace
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.520]   that you can have just by not having wars."
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.880]   So he reminds us, the whole book of Hebrews is to remind us of who Jesus is.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.920]   And then in conclusion to that, he says in verse 21, there's a very practical application.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.140]   It isn't just God is the God of peace, so therefore enjoy life.
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:36.280]   In verse 21, he says, "He's the one who equips you in every good thing to do his will, working
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.640]   in us that which is pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.440]   To him be the glory forever and ever.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.440]   Amen."
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.280]   The reason why he's saying all of this is not simply so that you wouldn't be anxious.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:52.000]   It's so that we may be anchored to this God of peace so that you may be equipped to do
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.840]   every good work.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.160]   There's a practical application to that.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:03.280]   Not to drift, to commit ourselves to Christ.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:09.880]   As we spend some time unpacking verse 21, because this is the conclusion of everything
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.640]   that we've been talking about, right?
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:19.880]   Before God uses us, he always empowers us.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.280]   Let me say that again.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.480]   Before God can ever use us, he always empowers us.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.540]   I think one of the biggest problems that you and I run into is we're rich.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:42.840]   We have access to education, to books, experience, churches, training, seminaries, Bible studies.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:50.680]   We have so much access to everything that we have the danger of what Jesus warned us
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.680]   about.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.640]   We have a tendency to think that we're self-reliant.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.400]   Then we have a tendency to minimize the power of God.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.160]   That's why, again, even in Bible teaching churches, where there's a heavy emphasis
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:09.360]   on studying and knowledge and knowing, but for whatever the reason, the Bible teaching
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.360]   churches tend to be really weak in prayer.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:22.240]   If we're not careful, even as we study the Bible, it's filling us up with pride, thinking
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.160]   that we can.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.400]   In Isaiah 40, 28-31, it says, "Do you not know, have you not heard, the everlasting
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.680]   God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, does not become weary or tired.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.480]   His understanding is inscrutable."
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.560]   He says all of this for a reason.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:45.120]   To be anchored to God, he says in verse 29, "He gives strength to the weary, and to him
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.400]   who lacks might, he increases power."
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.680]   Our might, our strength doesn't come from our education, from any experience, from being
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.160]   smart or being talented.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.600]   It's that he's the one who gives us strength.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.800]   He's the one who increases power.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.920]   Verse 30, "Though youth grow weary and tired, and vigorous young men stumble badly, yet
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.340]   those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength.
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.920]   They will mount upon the wings of the eagles.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:19.840]   They will run and not get tired, and they will walk and not become weary."
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.900]   You know, I think one of the most arrogant words in the modern language for a sinful
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.080]   man to say is, "I will."
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.080]   I will.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.000]   Because when we say, "I will," it means like, "I determine, I'm going to carry it out, and
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I'm going to fulfill it.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I will."
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.840]   Now, we may not think through all of that when we say it, but oftentimes a sinful man,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.920]   he says, "I will."
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.520]   He's saying that, "I'm going to do this."
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.480]   Remember what it says in the letter of James?
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.720]   It says, "Do not be arrogant."
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.760]   It said, "I'm going to go to this city, and I'm going to do it that city."
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.360]   He said, "The problem is not your plan.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.640]   The problem is you think that all of this is going to happen simply because you will."
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.360]   Rather say, "If the Lord wills, if He allows it."
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.680]   In other words, humble yourself.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680]   Recognize who you are.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.920]   See, the strength comes from Him.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:18.120]   The power that you and I need for sanctification, for good works, doesn't come from within us.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.400]   If we just go into our closets and just search deep within, that we're going to encounter
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.560]   something inside, and then it's going to come out.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.720]   That's how we're going to do this work.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.560]   He says, "No, it's not in us."
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.840]   When He says, "They will gain new strength.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.080]   They will mount upon eagles.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.540]   They will not get tired.
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.040]   They will walk and not become weary."
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.000]   Well, how do you do that?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.600]   He said in verse 31, "Those who," what?
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.280]   "Wait upon the Lord."
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.680]   Those who wait upon the Lord.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.480]   You can get all the training that you want.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.600]   You can read as many books as you want.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.920]   You can have all the experiences and pour all the money and latest technology.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.240]   He says, "No, that's not where the power, that's not where the strength is."
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.160]   He says, "Those who wait upon the Lord."
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:07.620]   He reminds us the God of peace, He's the one who will equip us for all good works.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.120]   This is pleasing to Him.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.640]   He's the one who will equip us.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:17.380]   You know the interesting word, the word equip here, in some of your translations has been
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.880]   translated to perfect.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.360]   But it's not the word teleos.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.640]   Teleos basically means that you've come to the end conclusion of what God had intended.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:33.360]   Basically it means to make it suitable for you for good works.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.600]   So everything that God has done, everything that He has said, knowing who He is, to commune
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.160]   with Him is so that you may be suitable for good works.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:49.200]   Let me take a minute to explain this because I think there's so much misunderstanding
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:57.360]   of good works because in our generation, in some circles, when you ... That's legalism.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.120]   We don't talk about what we do, we talk about what He did.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:05.720]   So good works has become a dirty word because that burdens people.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.400]   Good works judges people.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.520]   Good works causes us to look at other people and say, "Why do we keep talking about things
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.520]   that we can't do?
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.680]   So let's not talk about what we do, let's talk about what He does."
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:22.320]   And oftentimes the verse that is often quoted for that, Isaiah 64 verse 6, is, "For all
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.960]   of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like filthy
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.640]   garments.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.780]   And all of us wither like leaf, and our iniquities and like wind take us away."
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.600]   How many of you heard this ... Don't raise your hand, okay?
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.200]   So I may say something to contradict you, I don't want to embarrass you.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:47.680]   How many of you have heard this passage being taught saying that very thing that I said?
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.760]   All our good deeds are like dirty rags.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.080]   So why talk about dirty rags?
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.720]   Let's talk about His righteousness as He's imputed to us, that He's given to us.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:06.840]   So when we emphasize good deeds, all it is is dirty rags.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:12.280]   This is exactly why we need to study the Bible, because you can take verses out of context,
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.440]   and it sounds great because you have verses.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.400]   That's how cults form.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   You ever have a conversation with a Jehovah's Witness, and they are intimidating because
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.960]   they know so much scripture, until you actually open the Bible, and then you show them what
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.400]   it says before, and what it says after, and the context, and all of a sudden it's like,
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.600]   "Oh, they really don't know."
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.680]   They just pluck that verse out.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.480]   Well this is one of those verses.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.860]   Because if you look at the context of this, the very next verse, He says, "There is no
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.900]   one who calls on your name, who arouses himself to take hold of you, for you have hidden your
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:53.200]   face from us, and have delivered us into the power of our iniquities."
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.320]   Does that sound like a believer?
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.000]   God has turned His face around.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.040]   No one's taking hold of Him.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.760]   God's hidden His face.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.560]   Where else do you see this description?
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.480]   Romans chapter 3, when He describes all of sin and falls short of the glory of God, and
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.660]   He says, "No one sees God, not even one."
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:21.920]   So if you're not convinced, the very next verse absolutely makes it clear.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:28.760]   Verse 8, it says, "But," just that word alone, "But," you know He's going to change what
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.120]   He just said.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:37.080]   This is the state that man is in, "But now, O Lord, You are our Father.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:43.820]   We are the clay, and You are potter, and all of us are the work of Your hand."
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.400]   He's not saying to believers that everything that you do is just simply dirty rags.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   He's talking to unrepentant sinners, that when you try to do things, you're kind of
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:59.240]   like taking a dirty rag and you're just washing and just moving the dirt around.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:03.440]   Because the rag is much dirtier than what you're trying to clean.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:09.200]   So if you are an unrepentant sinner, every good deed is like washing things with dirty
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   rag.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.200]   That's what He means.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.600]   This is not a passage against good deeds.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:20.400]   In fact, the scripture makes it very clear that we are saved for good deeds.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.640]   Ephesians chapter 2, 8 and 9 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.080]   This is not your own.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:30.400]   It is the gift of God, not as a result of us, so that no one may boast."
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.840]   We sing this verse.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.760]   We memorize this verse.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:39.040]   But when you quote this verse outside of the context, and you leave out the whole part
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:44.560]   of what He says in verse 10, "For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for,"
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.560]   what?
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.560]   Good works.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:54.840]   He didn't just pluck us out so that you're no longer judged, and then the salvation is,
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.840]   it ends there.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.420]   It's like, oh, we're saved and we feel free.
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.360]   We have Christian liberty, and then you just enjoy life until we get to heaven.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:09.660]   He says, "No, He saved us not only from the penalty of sin, but the power of sin."
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.660]   He created us.
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:16.940]   The reason why He gave us grace is so that through the grace that you may commit yourself
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.940]   to good works.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:25.060]   Again, in 2 Corinthians 9, 8, "And God is able to make all grace abound to you so that,"
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:29.900]   the purpose of this grace, "so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times,
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.580]   you may abound in every good work."
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.460]   For every good work.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.180]   For whatever the reason, in our generation, we have separated the grace of God and good
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.180]   works.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.420]   Either you commit to it, oh, this church is about good works.
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.420]   They're legalistic.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:53.100]   I think it's very legalistic, the way that people use the term legalistic.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.060]   Every time we talk about good works and working hard and sanctification, it's like, "Oh, that's
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.700]   legalistic."
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.100]   The beauty of the gospel is not the good works.
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.660]   It's about what He did.
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:09.780]   But the reason why He did what He did, He says, is so that we can have good works, that
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.220]   we can restore what God had intended for us.
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:18.860]   2 Peter 1, 3, it says, "Seeing that His divine power has granted us, to us, everything pertaining
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:25.140]   to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.140]   excellence."
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:33.820]   Again, because of the generation that you and I live, our natural tendency, and if you
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:39.020]   go seek counseling, sometimes, sad to say, even within the Christian circle, when you
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.620]   confess your sins, one of the first things that they look for is, "What caused you to
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.620]   be that way?"
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:49.540]   What was your mother like?
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.460]   What was your father like?
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.820]   What was your past like?
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.820]   What's your birth order?
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.820]   Your first son?
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:02.540]   Oh, you had all that pressure to be good.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.540]   That's why you're that way.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.900]   Are you the middle son?
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.660]   Oh, everybody picked on you.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.260]   Your older brother picked on you, and you got in trouble every time.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.620]   You got in a fight with your younger brother, so everything was your fault.
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.700]   Like, oh, you're the baby.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.420]   You're loved all the time, so you got spoiled.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:24.300]   That's why you're ... Because your parents didn't raise you properly.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.140]   In modern psychology, when you say, "Hey, these are the problems," the first thing they
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.280]   look for is, "Why did you do that?
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.160]   What are the circumstances that you grew up in?
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.740]   What happened to you?"
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:41.380]   Indirectly, you say, "Oh, you sinned because of the woman that you put in here."
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.460]   Exactly what Adam said.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.780]   Instead of saying, "I sinned against you.
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.620]   I shouldn't have done that," he said, "Well, I did it because of the woman that you put
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.620]   in."
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.820]   He doesn't directly say, "It's your fault," but in essence, that's what he's saying.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:56.380]   He said, "Oh, bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh."
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:01.340]   Then as soon as he sins, he's like, "Yeah, that woman, that woman that you put in here
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.340]   tempted me.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.740]   Maybe you shouldn't have done that."
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:14.060]   See, he says, every time we make excuse, and we play the victim, you know what that
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.780]   means?
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:22.820]   That means God had enough power to pluck you out of hell, but he didn't have enough power
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.700]   to save you from sin.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:31.540]   You're indirectly saying, "I don't have everything that I need for a life of godliness.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.940]   Every time we come before God, I am the way I am because of those people treated me this
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:35.940]   way."
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.660]   So the power of God is not enough to save you from that?
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:46.340]   He said, "Everyone who knows Jesus Christ has been given everything that you need for
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.820]   a life of godliness."
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.620]   He has already given that to us.
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:55.020]   In Colossians 1, 28 through 29, we proclaim him admonishing every man and teaching every
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:00.620]   man with all wisdom so that we may present every man complete in Christ for this purpose.
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:07.860]   Also, I labor, striving according to his power, which mightily works within me.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:13.860]   Paul says, sometimes he seems like he's superhuman, right?
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:18.860]   He's getting beaten, forsaken by his own countrymen.
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:23.500]   He's learning how to sometimes starve.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:30.220]   He's been whooped to the point of death, bitten by scorpions, and he just keeps marching.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.220]   He just keeps marching.
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.340]   He just keeps going from city to city.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.340]   How did he do that?
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.180]   He said, "Because this is apostle Paul.
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.180]   He's well-educated.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.180]   He's a Roman citizen.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.180]   He had good examples.
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:46.700]   He had Gamaliel, the top scholar of his nation behind him.
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.020]   He comes from great pedigree."
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.020]   No.
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:57.660]   He said, "The power, the power that's working powerfully within me, it's that power that's
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.580]   giving him the power to be able to do what he is doing."
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:10.220]   If that is true, which you and I all believe, then shouldn't the greatest priority of every
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:16.340]   Christian all the time is to abide in Christ?
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:21.620]   Before we try to transform the world, before we try to be educated, before we try to do
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:26.340]   discipleship, before we do anything else, shouldn't the greatest priority of every Christian
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:33.860]   every single day is, "Am I genuinely abiding in Christ?"
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:39.380]   Because the moment we begin to do anything by our power, we realize how impotent and
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.380]   how weak we are.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:49.100]   You know what's interesting is, in Isaiah chapter 6, 3, 17 to 19, Isaiah prays to God
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.060]   for the nation of Israel.
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:56.620]   But if you know anything about the context of the book of Isaiah, Isaiah is basically
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.780]   warning them for superficial worship.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.580]   It wasn't because they were denying God.
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:06.700]   He doesn't talk about child sacrifice.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.620]   There's a lot of things that they did.
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:13.220]   At one point in Israel's history, they actually did that.
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.060]   Even cannibalism.
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.460]   That's how far they fell.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:22.020]   But Isaiah, Isaiah indictment against Israel wasn't that.
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.740]   They were very busy at the temple, making many sacrifices.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.940]   And he says then, because of the superficial worship, the Babylonians are going to come
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.860]   and take them into captivity.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:39.260]   So at the end of the book of Isaiah, after presenting his case, he prays to God for Israel.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.420]   So I want you to pay attention to this prayer.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:48.380]   He says in verse 17, "Why, O Lord, do you cause us to stray from your ways?"
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.380]   To stray from his ways.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:53.540]   Does that sound very familiar to what we've been studying?
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.660]   Just drifting?
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:04.620]   Most of us, most people who fall away or backslide, however you want to use that term, you see
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.740]   it years before it happens.
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.660]   You're just kind of busy.
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.380]   You get your priorities all mixed up.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.300]   Maybe you're dating somebody you shouldn't date.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.980]   Small compromises.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.140]   Pursuing things that you shouldn't pursue.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.140]   Doing things that you shouldn't do.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.720]   And you just kind of sweep it under the rug, sweep it under the rug.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.160]   And you begin to drift away from God.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.980]   Most people that I know who abandoned their faith don't wake up one day and say, "You
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.980]   know what?
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.980]   I'm done with God.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.980]   I don't believe this anymore."
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.020]   They walk away.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.660]   Most people that I've seen that walk away from their faith, you saw it years before
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.980]   they actually pulled the plug.
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:46.000]   They were just drifting and drifting and drifting, compromising one after another.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.640]   And then it becomes their lifestyle.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.740]   And they just kind of learn to adjust.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.980]   And so they're just hanging on by a thread.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.900]   And you only need one excuse to break that thread because it's not that strong.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:05.040]   He says, "Lord, do you cause us to stray from your ways and harden our hearts?"
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.420]   Everybody who continue to drift away from God, their hearts are hardened.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.740]   They attend worship, but songs are just songs.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.940]   They're not worshiping.
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.180]   Bible study is just study.
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:22.080]   You're serving the church because that's what you do as part of a community.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:27.820]   And the only sin that grieves you is the sin that you get caught in, that has immediate
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.140]   consequence, that you can't belong and part of this community.
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:35.340]   So it's not grieving God that you're concerned about.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.980]   It's about belonging in the community.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:44.960]   So it's really the only sins that we grieve over are the sins that bothers us.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.240]   So their hearts are hardened.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.380]   And we know that we're in the church long enough to know that true worship isn't just
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.420]   checking in and checking out.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.560]   So once your heart is hardened because we've been drifting and drifting and drifting, you're
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.940]   just attending church.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.740]   You're not worshiping God.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.080]   And then he says, "Why have you hardened our hearts from fearing you?"
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.520]   There's no fear of God in them.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.220]   He says the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.800]   But when your hearts have become hardened, there's no fear of God.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.420]   There's no consequences.
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.300]   So like I said, the only things that we repent of are the things that have immediate consequence
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.300]   on us.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:28.040]   And that's why you see pastors, elders, and leaders, and church people who can live a
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:35.800]   double life, committing all kinds of sin, and it doesn't bother them year after year
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.440]   after year until they get caught.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.580]   How did they do that?
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.580]   Because they were drifting.
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.620]   Their hearts become hardened.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:47.260]   And then the fear of God is no longer there.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.880]   They're functioning by the fear of man.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.540]   So as long as nobody calls them out, they're fine.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.900]   He prays and he says, "This is what has happened to Israel.
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:00.060]   We've allowed compromise after compromise after compromise."
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.220]   And they're no longer worshiping God.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.380]   There's no fear of God.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.100]   And yet they're coming to the temple, making sacrifice after sacrifices.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.700]   They're singing songs.
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.140]   They're gathering constantly.
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.500]   And what does God say to that?
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.360]   "I hate your evil assembly.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.020]   Everything that you're singing is just noisy, is noisy to me."
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:24.180]   He said, "Take your evil assembly away from me."
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.340]   Because there's no fear of God.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.340]   No true worship is happening.
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.540]   As a result of that, verse 18, it said, "Your holy people possessed your sanctuary for a
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:32.540]   little while."
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.660]   There was a period when there was genuine worship going on at the temple, but it said,
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.340]   "Our adversaries have trodden it down.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:43.140]   We have become like those over whom you have never ruled, like those who are not called
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.140]   by your name."
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.740]   And if a church continues to go down this path and there's no fear of God, there is
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:55.900]   a form of godliness, and yet there is no power, eventually the church doesn't look anything
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.900]   different than a non-Christian.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:58.900]   That's what he's saying.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:03.060]   There's people who've never worshipped you, but there's no difference, other than you
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.820]   go to church on Sunday and those people do not.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:12.580]   This is Isaiah's prayer describing the nation of Israel.
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:17.580]   And so his prayer is in chapter 64, verse 1 and 2, "Oh, that you would rend the heavens
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:24.460]   and come down, that the mountains may quake at your presence as fire kindles the brushwood,
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:29.580]   as fire causes water to boil, to make your name known to the adversaries, that the nations
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.060]   may tremble at your presence."
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:36.020]   If you look at the content of his prayer, he's asking for prayer of things that they
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.500]   cannot do.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:44.660]   When's the last time that you considered moving a mountain?
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.020]   Never.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.700]   That's a mountain.
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:55.980]   So when he prays to the Lord that you would come move the mountains, it's because he recognizes,
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:02.060]   he recognizes that their problem, their sin, is like a mountain.
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:07.460]   When we don't recognize the problem, we naturally think, let's gather together, let's make a
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.460]   plan.
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:13.260]   Can you imagine the ridiculousness of seeing a mountain ahead of you and then having a
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:18.580]   meeting, how are we going to level this mountain?
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.300]   Who's going to show up to that meeting?
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.300]   Who's going to say, "Yes, who's going to lead us in this endeavor?"
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.300]   Nobody.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:32.380]   Because you're a fool to think that somehow, that if we gather all our resources together,
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:38.340]   right, and buy enough shovels that we can move this mountain.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:43.100]   First and foremost, God brings us to a point where we recognize that this is a mountain
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.580]   ahead of us.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:51.860]   And even the way he describes, "Kindles the brushwood, as fire causes water to boil."
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:57.860]   Now if you've ever watched, you know, was it Man vs. Wild, Bear Grylls, he teaches us
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:03.780]   how to make fire, drink your pee, all kinds of stuff, right, to survive, right?
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:09.220]   And you know, I've seen, you know, like various ways that he creates fire, but I've never
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.940]   seen him say, "Here, here's what you do.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:20.140]   Just rub your hand real hard, all right, and it gets hot enough, just go, psh."
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.140]   Never.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.300]   Because he doesn't have that ability, so he has to get a stick or he has to get tinder
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.500]   or sometimes he has a lighter, right?
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.780]   But he can't generate the heat by himself.
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:39.300]   Even something as simple as lighting the brush fire or boiling water, you need something
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.820]   supernatural, something outside of you to do that.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:47.100]   So when he prays that you would come and you would shake the mountain and that you would
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:52.700]   burn the fire, because all of this is a description of man's sin.
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:58.260]   Because the greatest obstacle to mankind that disturbs our peace is not government.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.180]   It is not our economy.
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.740]   It's our sins.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:09.940]   And it's this arrogance of mankind that thinks, "I will.
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.940]   I'm going to do this.
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:11.940]   I'm going to move this mountain.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:12.940]   I'm going to generate this heat.
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.700]   I'm going to boil this water."
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:20.940]   And that's why Jesus says it's harder for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:24.300]   And he's not saying rich people can't enter the kingdom of God, but the temptation for
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:31.140]   rich man is that he thinks he can, because he has more resources.
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.220]   That's where you and I are at.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:39.500]   We have more seminaries, more churches, more Bible translations, more books to read, more
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.200]   sermons that we can have.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:49.100]   We have people filled with MBA degrees who've been successful in businesses, who are managers.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.260]   So our natural tendency is like, "Come on, let's get it together.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:59.660]   If we just use our smarts and ingenuity, we can do this."
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:06.620]   Isaiah, in his prayers, is admitting, "Only you can move the mountain.
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.300]   Only you can bring the fire."
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:16.700]   Roger Ellsworth, in his small book, Come Down, Lord, says this, "If we're not careful, we
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:22.380]   can think pushing all the right buttons will produce lasting spiritual results.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:27.060]   We can reduce the work of the church to shrewd maneuvering with statistical probabilities
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.060]   and psychological jargon.
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.340]   We can have polish, but not power.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:37.140]   We need to realize that God can do more in a minute with his power than we can in a lifetime
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.820]   with our strategies."
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:45.020]   There's a reason when you travel and you go to the remote parts of India that doesn't
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:50.420]   have half the resources, even a tenth of the resources that you and I have, and yet you
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:54.860]   see power of the gospel spreading through the villages.
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:59.620]   Men who are not educated, don't have the financial backing, didn't go to much training, they
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:04.340]   weren't properly discipled, they don't even have a way to get into some of these villages,
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:10.100]   and yet the power of God is moving tremendously through these villages because they understand
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:14.260]   that all they need is God.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.740]   They tend to pray more because they're desperate.
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:21.980]   They tend to cling to God more because they're desperate.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:22.980]   They don't have a lot of plans.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.260]   They don't have a lot of strategies.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.860]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.300]   All of these things are not evil.
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.060]   They're not bad.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.100]   We need to have more of it, right?
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.940]   God has given us intellect, he has resources, use it to the best of our ability.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:42.660]   But the temptation is to think that that's where the power is.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:46.900]   That is not where the power is.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:54.260]   You know, the scripture says, and he ends this section in verse 23, "I urge you, brethren,
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.700]   bear with this word of exhortation I have written to you briefly."
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:04.940]   In other words, take the word of God seriously.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:12.940]   We have a tendency, again, because we have so much resources, experience, gifting, money,
[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:19.340]   talent, I say, if we can gather all of that together, right, we can manipulate to get
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.780]   more people to come into church.
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:27.020]   I don't know how often, at least four or five times a year, I get an email from some organization
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:32.940]   promising me that if I use their strategy that I can milk more money from you.
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:38.940]   They guarantee 30%, right?
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.500]   But is that the goal of the church, to milk money from you, right?
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:46.340]   I want to try it to see if it actually works, right?
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.340]   Don't worry.
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.940]   I've never responded to that.
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:57.860]   Because God can do more with the little that you give honestly as an act of worship than
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.940]   much that you give grudgingly.
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:05.700]   And that is true not only of finances, but everything that you do.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.300]   You know what's interesting is in Matthew chapter 28, that's where the Great Commission
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.740]   is given, right?
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:16.740]   But before the Great Commission is given, before he commissions them to go, he allows
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.420]   the disciples to fail, remember?
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.300]   Where Jesus says, "I'm going to go to the cross and you're going to deny me."
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.780]   And remember what Peter says?
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:30.820]   He says, "They may do that, but I will not."
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.020]   That arrogant term, "I will not."
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.740]   And then Jesus says, "No, you're going to.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.220]   In fact, you're going to be the worst.
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:40.020]   You're going to deny me three times."
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.540]   And he gets utterly destroyed.
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.460]   He's humbled.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.900]   And so after they're humbled, because they're like, "Yeah, we're going to do this, you know,
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.500]   we've got as long as the Messiah is with us."
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:54.580]   And then Messiah is crucified on the cross and everybody's hides and they're in fear.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:58.500]   They don't even go to check the tomb.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.460]   You read the gospel, how many times Jesus says, "I'm going to be resurrected on the third
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.460]   day.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.460]   I'm going to be crucified.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.460]   I'm going to be resurrected on the third day."
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.820]   They're so scared that they don't even go check the tomb.
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:09.060]   The women have to go and check.
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.060]   They have to come back.
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.660]   And then when they came back, they didn't believe him because they were so fixated on
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.540]   their own glory.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.380]   But after they fail miserably, remember Jesus shows up and he feeds the disciples and he
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:23.380]   pulls Peter aside and he says, "Do you love me, Peter?"
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.660]   He said, "Yes, I do."
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.660]   And feed my sheep.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.660]   "Do you love me, Peter?"
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.660]   "Yes, I do."
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.660]   "Feed my sheep."
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.220]   "Do you truly love me more than these?"
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.780]   You know, and some people think that maybe these, he's talking about the fish.
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.420]   I don't think he's talking about the fish.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.420]   I could be wrong.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:46.500]   I think he's just pulling to the other disciples because that's exactly what he said before
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.900]   Jesus went to the cross.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.500]   They're all going to deny you, but not me.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:55.580]   It's like, "Peter, are you still confident that you love me more than these?"
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:56.580]   Right?
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:00.020]   These guys right there, right?
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.740]   You were so confident before.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.980]   "Lord, I love you."
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.300]   He said, "Then feed my sheep."
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.860]   His confidence has left.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.340]   His arrogance, "I'm going to do this."
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.500]   He's like, "Oh, man."
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.900]   He's just thankful that Jesus receives him back.
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:21.660]   And then he tells his disciples, "Meet me in our hometown in this mountain in Galilee."
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:26.140]   So this is where we pick up in Matthew 28, verse 16.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.980]   He's meeting them at the mountain where he's going to give the great commission.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.900]   This is what it says in verse 16.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:35.700]   "But the 11 disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.660]   When they saw him, they worshipped him."
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:39.660]   Let me stop right there.
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.340]   I mean, don't just read it.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.540]   I mean, they worshipped him.
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:51.140]   To a Jew, I mean, to anybody, you can't worship any of that.
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.900]   That's the first of the 10 commandments.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.520]   "Thou shalt not have any other gods before me."
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.420]   So they followed him.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.420]   They respected him.
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.180]   They honored him.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.260]   But then after the resurrection, they worshipped him.
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:11.620]   So if they had any doubt of his identity, his deity, this would have been blasphemous,
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.140]   worthy of stoning.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:20.460]   Even the angels were in terror when somebody would mistaken them and bow down and worship
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.460]   him.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.540]   He said, "Don't do that.
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:28.580]   Because if you worship me, you're going to be destroyed, and I'm going to be destroyed."
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:32.180]   But the disciples knew exactly who Jesus was, and that's why they bowed down.
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.180]   They worshipped him.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.140]   But here's what it says right after.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.900]   "They worshipped him, but some were doubtful."
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:41.500]   Why were they doubtful?
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.380]   They already worshipped him.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.460]   Did they worship him?
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.460]   You know?
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:50.460]   And then think to themselves, like, "Is he God?"
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.900]   You think that's what that meant when he said, "They worshipped him, but they were doubtful"?
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:54.900]   They already worshipped him.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:55.900]   It's like, "I'm not sure.
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:56.900]   I'm going to figure this out later."
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:05.540]   You know, what's interesting is the word for "distazo," "to doubt," means "to waver" or
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.540]   "to hesitate."
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:12.740]   Clearly, they didn't waver about his identity, because they already worshipped him.
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:19.460]   So many commentators believe, which I also believe, their doubt was themselves.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:24.480]   And if you read the context in where the Great Commission comes out, it makes more sense.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:28.300]   Because we often see the Great Commission, it says, "Go therefore and make disciples.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.720]   Baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:36.320]   But the context in which he says it is right after they fail.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.200]   They lose all confidence in themselves.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:44.400]   And then they meet and they worship him, thankful that he restores them, but some of them are
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.400]   doubtful.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.360]   "You're going to commission really us?"
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.640]   You see the attitude difference between before the crucifixion?
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.120]   "I'm going to do this.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.600]   They will all do this, but I will not."
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.600]   That afterwards, they're like, "Really?
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.120]   You're going to use me?"
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:08.040]   You know, I think many of us, if you've been walking with the Lord for any period of time,
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:14.240]   you know, in the beginning, you know, you come out thinking like, "I'm going to turn
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.960]   the world upside down for Jesus Christ.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.240]   I'm going to go out in a bang.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.680]   I'm going to share the gospel to the remotest part of the world.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.080]   And if I die early, glory to God."
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:32.760]   Three, four, five, six, 10, 20, 30 years go by and you have lost all confidence.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:37.400]   You've compromised more than you can remember.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.400]   And you've lost all confidence.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.400]   "I don't know if God can use me."
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.480]   And you just kind of, "I just want to stay in the back.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:50.280]   I just kind of ride this out to the end."
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:56.040]   And we have a tendency when we face these obstacles, which oftentimes it is ourselves,
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.880]   that it's like, "Oh, no, no, no.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.680]   Let those guys who are gifted, let the younger guys take care of that."
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.280]   And then we kind of fade to the background.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   And I believe that that's where the disciples were.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.360]   They worshipped him.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.000]   They loved him, but they doubted.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.440]   And it's in that context that Jesus says, came up to him, spoke to them and saying,
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.520]   "All authority has been given to me."
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.200]   The authority is not in you.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.600]   If you're worried about your power, good.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.920]   That's where you should be.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.480]   There's no power in you.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.480]   You can't move mountains.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.920]   You're not going to be able to start any fire.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.480]   I'm the consuming fire.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.720]   All authority has been given to me."
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.280]   And then he says, "Now, go."
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:41.480]   Go not because you're smart, not because you have a proven track record, but because all
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.880]   authority has been given to me.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.720]   Now go, make disciples.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:53.400]   And then he concludes by saying, "And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.400]   age."
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:59.760]   As much as the Great Commission is important, the context in which he says it and the power
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:05.080]   that they need to do it is his authority and his presence.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:11.520]   And that's why he says, "You cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me."
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.220]   You cannot bear fruit.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.520]   How many times have we heard that?
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.320]   How many times have we repeated that?
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.920]   How many times have we studied that?
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.720]   And yet so few people give their total attention.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:32.960]   You cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me because the power is not in you.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.520]   That's why the disciples, they say, "Okay, okay, thank you for restoring us."
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:40.360]   And then right before they go, remember what they're told?
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:49.180]   "Wait, when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, when the power that you need, Holy Spirit
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:53.980]   comes upon you, then you will be my disciples."
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.260]   In Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, to the remotest part of the world.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.020]   But he says to do what?
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.020]   To wait.
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:02.020]   Does that sound familiar?
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:03.020]   Yeah, Isaiah.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:07.460]   The passage that we looked at in the beginning of the sermon.
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:17.060]   It said, "Those who will not grow weary, mount up on eagles.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:21.140]   Those who wait upon the Lord will renew their strength."
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:27.500]   To recognize that this is a mountain.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.380]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:34.620]   I want you to have something very practical.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:38.060]   What does it mean then for God to empower us?
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.540]   We naturally think, "Okay, there's some supernatural power.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:44.340]   I'm going to go home in the closet until power comes.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:49.820]   I'm going to raise my hand and the Holy Spirit come now right here."
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:55.180]   I used to be in a charismatic, I got saved in a charismatic circle and we would have
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:45:01.140]   worship and we raise our hand and the Holy Spirit that's hovering around the room would
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:05.020]   touch my hands and then it would come.
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:08.380]   "Oh, I got it."
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.820]   And so we would wait and worship for the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:12.820]   Is that what he's talking about?
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.180]   And he says, "Wait for the power?
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.660]   Just wait, don't go."
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:25.060]   If that's what you think that that's what that means, then I've actually ruined you.
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.860]   Not only are you not going to do the work, you're going to have biblical reasons.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:31.740]   "No, I can't do it because I don't have the power."
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.660]   Let me give you something really practical.
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:38.860]   You know, every time I lead worship and you know, like somebody comes up, "Oh, thank you
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:43.220]   for leading worship and you know, I really like the way you do this and that."
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:47.000]   And I know myself, right.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:53.060]   That's one area that you can't pump me up in because I've been deflated.
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:56.220]   And let me tell you a practical story, okay.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:02.980]   Years ago when I was back in college, the ministry that was there at Biola, they were
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:09.020]   having some sort of like, I won't say a competition, it was worship, but they gather all the students
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.580]   and they were presenting a choir.
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:16.300]   So I was part of that choir and there was probably about 30 of us and all my close friends,
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.160]   everybody that I knew was in that choir.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:25.540]   So the choir director, she was leading us and she said, "We need somebody to do a solo."
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.860]   And so my friends, they say, "Oh, Peter has a good voice."
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.020]   So they recommended, right.
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:35.180]   They offered me up.
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:38.060]   You know what comes next when they offer you up.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.180]   So I said, "Oh, okay."
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.500]   And so she said, "Peter, why don't you come down?"
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.420]   So she gave me a line that I'm supposed to sing and I did a solo, right.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.100]   I mean, my ego is inflated.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.100]   It's like, "Yes, finally, somebody knows."
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:57.940]   So I walked down from everybody and I stood there and I said, "Go ahead, Peter."
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:58.940]   And they started playing along.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.940]   So I started singing, right.
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:05.940]   It's like waiting for standing ovation, right.
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:12.460]   After I did my little piece, I could tell by her expression that she wasn't impressed
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.260]   and she didn't say a thing.
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:18.940]   She just like, after I finished, dead silence.
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.860]   And then she said, "Okay, thanks, Peter.
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.260]   Is there anybody else that can..."
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:31.340]   And so I went from, "Oh," to, "Oh my gosh."
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:36.900]   And I was humiliated in front of all my friends and I crawled back into the choir and I sang
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:44.100]   as small as I could and I realized, okay, my voice is a choir voice.
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:48.420]   There's some people, I mean, the people who sing up here, I mean, they have good voices.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.420]   Mine's a choir voice.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:55.180]   It sounds good when it's drowned out by other noise.
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:48:01.100]   So people say, I say, "Oh, if that's how insecure you are about your voice, then why do you
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.100]   sing?
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.860]   Why do you need praise?"
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:08.700]   Because I'm not trying to lead you in singing.
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:12.180]   I'm trying to lead you in worship.
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:15.820]   And it doesn't matter what you think.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:16.820]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.700]   I'm not like, "Oh, I'm so bad."
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:24.420]   It's like, you know, I'm not trying to be fake humble, right?
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:26.420]   It's good enough to be in a choir.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:30.220]   I understand that, right?
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:33.600]   But I've been freed.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:39.500]   If my goal was my own glory, I would not do that because I know there's room filled with
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:43.380]   people who are much more talented than I am, much more gifted than I am.
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:48.220]   There's a lot of things that I do that I know there's people who are much better than I
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.220]   am.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:52.820]   But I've been freed from myself.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.140]   I'm not doing it for my glory.
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.820]   I'm not doing it to get your praise.
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:06.300]   And there's a reason why Jesus says, "He who seeks his life will lose it, and he who loses
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.540]   his life for my sake, he will find it."
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:16.980]   I have been freed from myself so that I can live my life to give him the glory.
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:20.480]   I don't get the greatest happiness from you.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.860]   My greatest joy comes from him.
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.260]   I've been freed.
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:32.020]   And every single one of you have been freed, if you can just accept that.
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:36.660]   That's why we practice God-centered worship.
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:40.340]   Because when you're at the center, it ruins you.
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:42.340]   It ruins you.
[00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:46.780]   Even when we're doing good works, we'll always have one eye out the other to see if somebody
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.820]   else is noticing me.
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:52.420]   Or we have the other eye looking, is anybody else judging me?
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.900]   Am I doing a good enough job?
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:50:01.620]   And so that concern for you is ruining everything that you do.
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:09.260]   But if you place God where he needs to be, you're free.
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:10.260]   You're free.
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.700]   It doesn't matter what other people think.
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:16.580]   It doesn't matter how good of a job that I do.
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:24.940]   Because in the end, all I want is to glorify God and for you to join me.
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:32.740]   I pray that every single one of us would know this Jesus, surrender to this Jesus, to be
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:40.260]   anchored to this Jesus, that we may be properly equipped for every good work for his glory.
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:43.060]   Let's pray.
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:49.740]   Again, as our praise team comes up, let's take a few minutes to come before the Lord
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.900]   in prayer.
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:57.980]   Let the word of God not just enter into your head, but enter into your heart.
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:00.700]   Have you been drifting?
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.460]   Where do you find your peace?
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:06.140]   What are you looking to?
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:12.180]   To take some time to come before the Lord and find your confidence in him.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.940]   Again, as our worship team leads us, let's take some time to pray.
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:24.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
