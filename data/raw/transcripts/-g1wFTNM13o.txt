[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560]   A listener named Kevin writes in to ask, "Can we reconcile creation and evolution,
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.800]   or are they contradictory?" Pastor John, what would you say? I think what I'd say
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:24.360]   first is that evolution as it is ordinarily meant in our culture, namely
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.960]   naturalistic evolution, evolution minus God, evolution as an explanation of the
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.900]   origin of life when God is not there to explain it, is incompatible with creation,
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.920]   incompatible with God, incompatible with Christianity. And so that's the main form
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.480]   we're dealing with in the world, and therefore we ought to be alert to it,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.240]   prepare our kids to encounter it, and realize that the reason, main reason,
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.080]   evolution has been pursued and described is because when you leave God out of
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.000]   account, it seems like, "What else can it be?" But if you bring God into account,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.360]   then you might say, "Oh, well that whole effort to account for things might not
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.200]   be necessary if there's a God in the universe or above the universe who
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.640]   brought it into being in other ways." So that's the first thing I'd say.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:30.000]   But probably the questioner has in mind a kind of evolution that would be
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.360]   coherent with, possibly, theism or Christianity. Can God have been the one
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.240]   who so designed, the intelligent designer behind the process of billions of
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.200]   years of natural selection? And the answer is, theoretically, yes. But
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.760]   exegetically, we've got a problem. I'll just give my three or four stumbling
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.400]   blocks that give me very great pause for affirming evolution, and keep me from
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.040]   going there, keep me from believing that that's the way it was done. One is the
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.240]   problem of death. This is probably the biggest one for me. If there's been billions of
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.600]   years of life and death, carnage, how do you make sense of Romans 5:12, "that sin
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.360]   came into the world through one man, and death through sin?" And if you do a study
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.280]   of death throughout the New and Old Testament, it doesn't appear that that
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.320]   can be conveniently limited to human death after God somehow turned an ape
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.800]   man into a human. That doesn't work very well. Death really appears to be, in
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.160]   all of its stretches, a part of the fall in sin which happened in a man. So
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.760]   that's one of my biggest problems in saying there have been billions of
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.240]   years of death in the world leading up to a man. The second is just the
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.480]   sheer textual affirmation, "God made the beasts of the field according to their
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.880]   own kinds." If you read that and say, "according to their own kinds," now doesn't that seem to
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.760]   imply that God was involved in the direct making of kinds of beasts and
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.360]   birds and fish? And the third one is the way it describes man's creation.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.360]   "The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.760]   nostrils the breath of life, and he became a living soul." It does not sound like God
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.440]   worked through billions of years of evolution in order to find a being that
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.680]   he would now regard as worthy of being breathed into or something like that.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.360]   And the fourth thing, in my own experience, I mean, I just have to say
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:05.440]   that intuitively, as I read magazines and look at Ranger Rick and National
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:13.520]   Geographic and the Blue Planet and all these unbelievable portrayals of nature,
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:22.200]   I just say intuitively, "I can't buy it." The complexities of things, including the
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.360]   human eye or a little spider who breathes air, lives at the bottom of a
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.040]   pond, comes up, gets a bubble of air under his arm, takes it down, stores it under
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.000]   his little mat house at the bottom so he can breathe down there and have his
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.640]   babies underwater, which is just so crazy. You want to say, "where did this
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.080]   awesome display of diversity and intricateness and complexity come from,
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:01.000]   if not from a Creator God?" So here's my summary answer. Theoretically, yes, you
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.800]   could have a God overruling billions of years and call it theistic evolution.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.280]   Exegetically, it's going to be harder to make that stand. Theologically, you've
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.920]   got to have, I believe, Adam as a created person at the head of his humanity so
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.080]   that Christ, according to Romans 5, can be a counterpart head of his humanity, can
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:30.680]   have Adam being a non-historical being. And then intuitively, I'm just going
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.800]   to have to go at root here with what seems unbelievably unlikely to me.
