[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.760]   Okay, so obviously, hopefully you have your Bible with you.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.040]   If you don't, you really need it.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.040]   Okay?
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.040]   See, if you didn't bring it, I encourage you to bring it.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.700]   It's a Bible study, so you should be bringing it, right?
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.360]   But if you have the electronic version of it, you're going to have to turn it there
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.540]   and keep it there because we're going to just be going through the passage systematically.
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.760]   And so I'm going to be reading some of it, and I'm just going to be going over some of
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.760]   it.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.640]   So again, I encourage you to just open it up to Leviticus 19, just keep it there because
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:51.600]   we're going to go over the passages verse by verse.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.000]   And as I mentioned to you, we're going to be in the NASB.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Okay?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.720]   So I'm not saying you have to change, but your life will be much easier.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.320]   All right.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.440]   All right, let me pray for us and we'll jump in.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:21.920]   Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you, Lord, for to be able to come together.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.960]   However we've spent our week, however the rest of the week will look, we know that we
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.480]   need to be constantly reminded of who you are so that we do not drift.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.420]   We live in a physical world, Lord, with temptations all around us.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.200]   We need you, Lord God, to continually open our eyes, soften our hearts, Lord God, that
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.400]   it does not harden.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.280]   We are so easily distracted.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.520]   So we pray, Father God, that your word would grip our minds, our hearts, and our lives,
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.240]   that we would be guided not by our flesh, but by your spirit.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.480]   So we pray for your blessing.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.920]   We pray for insight and wisdom as we study your word.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.600]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.600]   Amen.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.600]   All right.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.560]   So Leviticus chapter 19, I wanted to just kind of look at the kiastic structure just
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.680]   so that you know where we are at.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.880]   So I found another picture that I thought maybe would be helpful, the kiastic structure
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.760]   of the book of Leviticus.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.640]   So if you look at it, this one instead of just kind of going over the outline, it gives
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.920]   you a pyramid.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.440]   And on the bottom, chapter 1 through 7, is about the rituals, right, about the five different
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.440]   offerings.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.340]   And then chapter 8 through 10 is about the priesthood, 11 through 15, about all the purity
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.280]   laws of different animals, what's clean and unclean.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.140]   And at the peak of it was the day of atonement.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.960]   So the main thrust of the book of Leviticus is explaining the day of atonement, right?
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.960]   And then it works backwards.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.020]   We're talking about purity where we are now, chapter 17 to 20.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.280]   So chapter 17, we talked about the blood.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.900]   Chapter 18, we talked about sexual purity.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.320]   And then chapter 19, we're going to be talking about what does it mean to be holy.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.240]   And then chapter 20, and vice versa.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.600]   So what is the difference between the structure to the left and structure to the right, if
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.160]   it mimics, right?
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.960]   If 11 through 15 and 17, 20 is talking about purity, remember, what is the distinction
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.260]   between the chiastic structure to the left versus the right?
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.000]   What does the left emphasize and what does the right emphasize?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.180]   I hear murmuring, but I don't...
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.600]   What does the right emphasize?
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.940]   Huh?
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.500]   Application.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.780]   Okay.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.140]   Okay.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.420]   Okay.
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.620]   Good.
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:09.600]   So the left side is more of a pure ritual in the context of the tabernacle, right?
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.360]   So what is pure and impure and why do you need to be pure, impure?
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.980]   Because you need to get into the tabernacle.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.100]   You can't come in and offer sacrifices or give worship to God if you don't have these
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.100]   things.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.220]   So the right is about life within the context of the Israelite community.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.700]   So you can already see that.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.580]   Chapter 18, we talked about sexual immorality and that specifically is pertaining to the
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.580]   community.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.780]   So chapter 19, when he says, "Be holy," he's talking about in the context, again, of the
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.780]   community.
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.180]   Just so that you understand where we're at.
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.820]   So the primary theme of this section and the whole book of Leviticus is found in verse
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.620]   2, which is, "You shall be holy for the Lord your God am holy."
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.540]   Obviously, this is repeated several places in the Bible, in particular in the epistles
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.540]   of Peter.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.500]   It says, "Be holy for I am holy."
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.860]   See, this commandment is the central commandment of the book of Leviticus.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:17.500]   And it's probably, you can say that this commandment is really the central commandment of the Bible.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.980]   Everything that God is doing is to make us holy, to be set apart, to become more like
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.260]   him.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.900]   But why would this be a motivation?
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.980]   Underlying the motivation of this commandment, "Be holy because he is holy."
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:39.460]   A non-believer of Yahweh, non-worship of Yahweh, this would not be a motivation.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.460]   This motivation to be holy because he is holy, there's a prerequisite that you or he is talking
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.260]   to people who are already worshiping God.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.580]   Let me give you an example.
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:58.300]   I'm not really much into shoes, but I've read in, I think it was a Facebook article somewhere
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.740]   that new Kobe Bryant shoes is coming out, the Mamba shoes, number 24.
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.940]   You guys know anything about that?
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.740]   I know you do.
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.300]   I heard that it's coming out and it has his name, it has his number, it has his little
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:19.420]   logo and he sells millions of dollars worth of shoes because of his name.
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.940]   Now why would people buy his shoes?
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.700]   If you put my name on it, no one's going to buy it.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.220]   Why do they buy his shoes?
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.100]   Because his name and his number is on it.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.660]   Yeah, they idolize him.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.980]   There's something about Kobe.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.020]   Maybe that's your favorite player.
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.900]   Maybe even worship him.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.620]   And so if that's a person that you admire and you worship and you enjoy watching him
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.660]   play and having his name on that shoes makes it attractive.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:03.060]   And so when God says, "Be holy for I am holy," there's a preconceived understanding that
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:10.020]   that would only be a motivation towards somebody who has already an affection for God.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.180]   Why do you want to be holy?
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.180]   Because he is holy.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.340]   So if you're not worshiping God, there's no affection for him, that is not a motivation.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.740]   I don't have any desire to become like him.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.820]   I don't have any desire to reflect him.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:30.140]   So this command in and of itself, it's a central command, but it would only be a motivating
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:36.380]   factor that he is holy so I need to be holy because he's talking to people who are already
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.700]   worshiping him.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.180]   So when we come to the New Testament, when Peter says, repeats the same phrase, "Be
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:48.060]   holy for I am holy," for the Lord your God is holy, he's talking to people who have already
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.460]   been restored in worship.
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:57.060]   So the prerequisite for any sanctification, prerequisite for any desire to honor God and
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.620]   to live a holy life is a desire to worship him.
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.340]   An affection for him has been restored because of the blood of Christ.
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.220]   He opened our eyes, regeneration already happened.
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:14.900]   And so again, Jonathan Edwards says in his book, Religious Affection, one of the greatest
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:21.540]   marks of a genuine Christian is that there is a genuine affection for God that's been
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.940]   restored.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.660]   So the beginning of this chapter begins in verse 12, "Be holy because he is holy," and
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.160]   that's the motivating factor and that's what we're going to continue to see.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:42.280]   Only those who already worship God would this motivation be of any relevance.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:47.400]   We were originally created to be God's image bearers.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.700]   Israel's calling was to reflect his image, to restore the large image of God in the world.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:58.980]   So the whole point of redemption is to restore that image.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:05.020]   The whole point of calling Israel and what makes them unique is that he called them,
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:11.700]   set them apart, made them holy to be different from the world, not simply for their sake
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:17.220]   but by God restoring that image upon them that they would restore that image in the
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.980]   world.
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.740]   Israel was a tool for the purpose of restoring image in the world.
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.060]   So everything about what God is doing is really wrapped up in this command, "Be holy for
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:32.540]   I am holy," because that's what was lost at the fall and that's what he's trying to restore,
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:39.420]   holiness in his people.
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:44.020]   The phrase, "I am the Lord your God," occurred 16 separate times.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.620]   Now we talked about that in chapter 18.
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:51.100]   He mentions, "I am the Lord, I am the Lord," and so when he says that, it is to emphasize
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.780]   his authority, right?
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.860]   These are not just suggestions, these are not just things that we're hoping, like Proverbs,
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.540]   the good rules to follow.
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.260]   He says, "No, I am your God, I am your King."
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:10.660]   So it's to establish his authority and to remind Israel whose command that they need
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.660]   to follow.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:17.020]   Remember last week, to not to be like the Egyptians, not to be like the Canaanites.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:22.100]   He says, "I am the Lord, you are to follow my statutes, you are to follow my rules, my
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.100]   judgment."
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:29.260]   And so he, again, establishes that here 16 separate times, right?
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.340]   These commands are central.
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:39.900]   So up to this point, Leviticus, holiness primarily referred to ritual holiness related to the
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.900]   tabernacle.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.460]   Remember we talked about that, the chiastic structure?
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:48.220]   When he talked about holiness, he's talking about how to stay pure so that they can offer
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.740]   sacrifices.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.900]   From this point on, there is a transition that takes place where holiness will be used
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.140]   primarily in reference to a personal or national moral quality.
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.140]   Again, the chiastic structure to the right.
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:09.620]   Left is for the purpose of tabernacle, right is for the purpose of community.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:14.060]   So most, if not all of the Ten Commandments are mentioned in the call to be holy in chapter
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.140]   19.
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.540]   So if you studied chapter 19, you probably already saw that, right?
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:27.020]   Now when I say most, or if not all, it really depends on how you interpret that, right?
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:34.100]   But you can easily make the case that in chapter 19, all 10 of the Ten Commandments are repeated,
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.300]   right?
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.460]   Most of the application of being holy in the context of human relationships.
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.820]   Let me stop right there.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.980]   Usually when we think of holiness, we think of what you shouldn't do, right?
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.620]   When you say, "Man, I need to really live a holy life."
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.940]   Like, what does that mean?
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:53.940]   Right?
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.060]   "I should stop watching certain movies.
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.940]   I should stop doing certain things.
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.020]   I should maybe, if you're cursing, I should stop cursing."
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.300]   So there's things that we say, "Well, we shouldn't do it because these are things that
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.100]   are dishonorable to God."
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:14.620]   Well, in chapter 19, he calls the nation to be holy, but the practical application of
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.100]   holiness is in what context?
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:23.980]   It's the context with how we interact with people, right?
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:29.620]   He said, "I don't know, when was the last time you really considered holiness is the
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.900]   way you treat people, of being gracious and compassionate?"
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:39.060]   Because we typically think holiness and mercy and grace are two different things.
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.940]   So whenever we talk about holiness, we say, "Well, you know, I think we need to emphasize
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.940]   mercy and grace."
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.180]   Or maybe if somebody emphasizes mercy and grace too much, "Hey, what about holiness?"
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.820]   And we talk about it in the church as if these are two separate things.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.900]   That's not how the Bible talks about it.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:04.140]   The word holiness does mean to be morally upright, right?
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.700]   That is the overarching meaning of the word holiness.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.940]   But there's another word for holiness, a literal understanding of the word holiness.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:21.460]   What is the literal understanding of the word holiness?
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.340]   To be what?
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.260]   Set apart, right?
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.060]   To be set apart.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:35.180]   So an article that was set apart from common for God's use became holy.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:40.060]   An individual who became a priest when he was anointed, it was set apart for God's use,
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.580]   he became holy.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:47.740]   So the overarching meaning of the word holy is to be set apart, unique, right?
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.540]   Different, dedicated to the Lord.
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.980]   That's the overarching meaning.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.100]   In the overarching meaning, there are specific things what God tells you to do.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.580]   There's certain things for you not to do, right?
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:09.340]   So in the meaning of the word holy, love and mercy is also holy.
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.800]   Now why is it holy?
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.260]   Because it's supposed to be set apart.
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260]   It's different.
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:20.420]   So when we talk about the love of God, the love of God is holy because His love is unlike
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.280]   the love of the world.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:30.420]   His mercy is also holy because His mercy is unlike the mercy of the world, right?
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:36.580]   His justice is holy justice because His justice is unlike any other justice in the world.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.540]   It is set apart.
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:43.940]   So within the understanding of the word holy, love is incorporated in that.
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.300]   These are not two separate terms.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.300]   Are we going to talk about holiness or are we going to be talking about love?
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.260]   Holiness encompasses love, right?
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:57.020]   So people say, you know, oftentimes you'll see people saying like, oh, you know, the
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.700]   Bible says God is holy, holy, holy.
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.780]   He never says He's love, love, love.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.620]   And the reason why He doesn't say love, love, love is because holy, holy, holy encompasses
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.620]   love.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.380]   Do you get, do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.380]   Okay.
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.380]   Okay, some of you do.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.380]   All right.
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.380]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:19.140]   The reason why I'm saying this is because the application of holiness in the chapter
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.460]   19 is primarily about what?
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.980]   Primarily about mercy.
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.940]   If you read it, right?
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.220]   If you haven't read it, you'll find out, right?
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.860]   So the primary application is that be holy for I am holy.
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.420]   Well, what does that mean, God?
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.420]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.180]   And so that's where we're headed.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.220]   You don't have this on your outline because I just couldn't fit it.
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.260]   I'd have to print another 120 pages just because of this.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.420]   I didn't print it.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.420]   Okay?
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:58.940]   So this is the sphere, the arena of life where holiness is to be practiced to the left.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:04.180]   In your family, in worship, business practices, treatment of poor, disadvantage, in the court,
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:11.460]   ritual practice, all of these are in the context of showing mercy and compassion, to be generous
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.540]   to the left.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.980]   And these are the passages that describe that.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.540]   And this is the application of holiness.
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:25.100]   You follow?
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.820]   So what I'm going to do is, again, I'm going to go over all these passages.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:34.440]   There's more than 30 separate commands given in chapter 19.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.460]   So I'm not going to go over every single one of these commands.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.060]   So I grouped them so it's easier for us to follow.
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.580]   So as we're going, so there's a lot of it.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:47.780]   So if I stand, sit here and just spend even two minutes on these, it's going to take us
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.780]   over an hour.
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.780]   So I'm not going to do that.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.220]   So I'm going to go over pretty quick.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.940]   But I'm just going to go over verse five.
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.180]   This is where you need to have your Bible open.
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.180]   Okay?
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:02.540]   So if your Bible is not open, if your phone is not too in that text, I encourage you to
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.540]   do that now.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:10.980]   So in 1 Corinthians 4, it deals with fifth, fourth, first, and, fifth and fourth, I spelled
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:17.380]   the fourth wrong, and the first of the Ten Commandments.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:22.500]   The commandments to be holy begins with the first of the horizontal relational aspect
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.580]   of the Ten Commandments, instead of the first of the vertical relationship with God.
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.820]   Let me tell you what I mean by that.
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:35.340]   He says to practice holiness, and the application of that practice is to show mercy and grace
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.300]   and love to the community.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:42.100]   So if you look at verse three, "Every one of you shall reverence his mother and his
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.820]   father and you shall keep my Sabbath and I am the Lord your God."
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.820]   Right?
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.660]   Do not turn to the idols or make yourselves molten gods.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.700]   I am the Lord your God.
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.220]   So there's three commandments that are mentioned here.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:59.540]   Honor your father and mother, which is the fifth commandment, right?
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:05.140]   Keep the Sabbath, which is the fourth commandment, and then don't worship any other gods, which
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.360]   is the first commandment, right?
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:13.020]   He starts, typically if you were to list the Ten Commandments, the very first thing that
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:18.100]   you would think when he says God says to be holy for I am holy, you would think the very
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.780]   first commandment would be the one that comes out, right?
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.940]   "Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.340]   Don't make any graven images."
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.340]   You know, you would think that that's the first thing that comes out.
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.720]   But instead, it's flipped, right?
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:37.660]   The fifth commandment is the first of the second set of commandments, which deal with
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.460]   what?
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.980]   Loving your neighbors, right?
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.980]   Loving people.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.260]   So the first four commandments is loving God with all your heart.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.460]   And then the number five through ten is love your neighbors as yourself.
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:56.140]   But he starts by saying the first of the second set.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.220]   So it kind of, you understand where I'm going with this, right?
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.300]   So he begins with that, honor your father and mother, which comes with the promise if
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:11.220]   you want to live long and prosper, you must honor your father and mother, right?
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:16.660]   The fourth commandment to keep the Sabbath bridges the vertical relationship, right?
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.140]   It's the fourth commandment, right?
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.540]   The first three commandments is commandment to God, and then the fourth commandment bridges
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.460]   between God and man.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:34.780]   The way it bridges it is because the Sabbath was to be set apart to rest, to give worship
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.860]   to God, corporate worship to God.
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:41.300]   But it was meant to be done in the context of community, right?
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.740]   So that's why keeping the Sabbath bridges the first four commandments with the second
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.500]   six commandments.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:52.300]   And then he ends with the first commandment, okay?
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.860]   Now why, I'm not going to spend this kind of time with all of these, all of this section,
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.820]   but I'm telling you this because this sets the tone for what he's about to say for the
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.740]   rest of the chapter, okay?
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.100]   I want to make sure you guys are following, so I don't want to go too fast and then you're
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.260]   just giving me a blank stare like you're doing right now, all right?
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.980]   You follow, tell me you're following up to this point.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:15.980]   Okay, you get it.
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.480]   All right, all right, good, okay?
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.500]   So that's how it begins.
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.100]   Verses five through eight.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.060]   Now when you offer sacrifices of peace offerings to the Lord, you shall offer it so that you
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.060]   may be accepted.
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.540]   It shall be eaten the same day you offer it.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:38.860]   So five through eight basically is about the peace or the fellowship offering, right?
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.220]   Now what's unique about this offering?
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:48.780]   Right, it was the only offering where they actually ate the meat.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:54.700]   They burned up the things that are not edible and then they saved the choicest part and
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.520]   then they went to the side of the tabernacle and they had a picnic.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:05.480]   So the point of this offering wasn't simply about God, but it's having our sins forgiven
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.760]   by God and the ramification is restored fellowship.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.760]   Okay?
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.320]   Do you see this theme?
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.320]   Be holy, right?
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.320]   Honor your father and mother, which is the beginning of the second set of commandments,
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.320]   right?
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.560]   And then the second set basically says to make sure that you do this peace offering
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.560]   correctly.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.520]   And then he repeats what he says in the earlier chapters about the peace offering.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.520]   Okay?
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.760]   All right, now you follow.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:37.400]   You see where he's going with this?
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.440]   This offering was given to remind the Israelites that holiness is directly linked to the community
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.680]   life of God's people.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:49.960]   And again, 1 Corinthians 3, 16, 17 reminds us that do you not know that you are a temple
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.120]   of God and the spirit of God dwells in you?
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.660]   If a man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him for the temple of God is holy
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.320]   and that is what you are.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.560]   So what context is this text written in?
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:06.640]   A group of people in Corinth who are being divided.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:13.320]   And he says, do you not know that your community is a temple of God and is holy?
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.160]   So if you do not acknowledge them, if you do not care for them, if you do not work to
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.320]   keep the unity, you are defiling the temple of God.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.560]   Okay?
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.920]   You follow?
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.320]   Okay.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:35.960]   So this is all linked to practice of holiness, community.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.800]   Verses 9 through 10 teaches Israel to be mindful of people who are in need.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.840]   Let's look at verse 9 and 10.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.000]   Now when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very corners of
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.120]   your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest, nor shall you glean your
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.000]   vineyards, nor shall you gather the fallen fruit of your vineyards.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.640]   You shall leave them for the needy, for the strangers.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.520]   I am the Lord your God.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:06.040]   And this was given strictly for the purpose of the people who are walking through your
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.480]   fields and who are poor.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:17.440]   I mean, I don't know about you, but when we think of the Old Testament God, superficially,
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:24.640]   we think of, you know, the Jericho, we think of him conquering Pharaoh, we think of the
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.320]   flood where he kills, you know, the nation because he's angry.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.600]   And so a lot of times we have an image of this God who is vengeful and wrathful, and
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.800]   then he kind of disappears in the New Testament, and then we see that same God in the book
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.440]   of Revelation, when you read it superficially.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.440]   Right?
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:47.600]   But when you really dig into the Old Testament, this is what you see, right?
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.260]   This is what you see.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:55.800]   Why would a God be concerned about poor people walking through someone else's field in a
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.900]   foreign land?
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.760]   But that's the God that he wanted to make sure was restored.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:08.400]   So when he says, "Be holy," restore the image that was lost at the fall, right?
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:14.240]   That's what being holy means, to restore the image that we lost.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.480]   Part of the image that God wants us to restore back to us individually and as a community
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.520]   and for the world to see is this, right?
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:29.400]   What God does this?
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:37.920]   So again, this is a crucial part of God desiring to be represented in the world as being merciful
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.680]   because this is who he is.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   This is his nature.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:46.400]   And it is because that is his nature why you and I are alive.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.680]   Verses 11 and 12, right?
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.040]   It deals with stealing and bearing false witness, right?
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.480]   And how the Israelites are commanded to practice holiness by practicing honesty and having
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.360]   integrity with one another.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:05.920]   You see how any one of these things, right, can either ruin the community by not practicing
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.520]   or practicing it, right?
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.760]   Every one of these commandments, if we practice it the way God practiced it, what kind of
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.440]   community would we have?
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.420]   And this is what was lost at the fall.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.680]   Every man for himself, right?
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.560]   Every man for his own glory.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.500]   Every man to be acknowledged.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:29.320]   And so imagine if you live in a community where everybody is just looking out for themselves,
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.320]   right?
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.760]   And the only reason why they're being nice to you is because they got something to gain
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.240]   from you.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.320]   All of that was a result of the fall.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:47.960]   So what God is doing is restoring what was lost because of sin, right?
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.400]   Verse 13 and 14, dealing with integrity, okay?
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.960]   13 and 14.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.160]   You should not oppress your neighbors nor rob him.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:00.040]   The wages of a hired man are not to remain with you all night until morning.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.400]   You should not curse a deaf man nor place stumbling block before the blind, but you
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.960]   shall revere your God, I am the Lord.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   Okay?
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.200]   Again, when you just read it out of context, it may just seem random, but basically he's
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:19.480]   restricting people who have authority to abuse their authority, right?
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.960]   Because that's just a natural tendency, right?
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.920]   If you happen to be the boss, if you're not careful, you can abuse your authority, like
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.440]   for your own benefit.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.600]   And so he's restricting them.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:37.600]   If you're in a position of power, right, be careful that you're not wielding that for
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.920]   selfish purposes.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:46.400]   Then you're not oppressing people simply because you can, right?
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:54.480]   So part of the reason years ago why I stopped going out to feed the homeless, and I shared
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.240]   this with you before, that we were doing this for seven years and then there was another
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:03.880]   larger church that came down on the street and they started feeding the homeless.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:07.000]   And then we said, "Hey, we've been here seven years, but they were a larger church.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.520]   They had better food than us, so we ended up joining them."
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:15.040]   So we're feeding them one way or the other, who cares what name we put on it?
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.480]   So we just joined them for about a year or two.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:23.440]   Then after about a year of doing that, I noticed that when they were feeding the homeless,
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.760]   the lady that was in charge of it would end up yelling at the homeless, "If you want to
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.960]   eat, you better listen."
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.800]   And she would just chew them out.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.880]   Sometimes she would be in the middle of singing or something, and then if somebody's not paying
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.800]   attention, she would go like 10 minutes just ripping into them.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.920]   "And if you don't listen, I'm not going to give you the food.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:47.200]   If you don't shut your mouth, we're not going to feed you."
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.880]   And I remember just sitting there thinking, "Man, I don't want to be a part of this."
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:58.080]   So I would, for a time, wait until the feeding is done, and then we would wait until they're
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.000]   eating and then we would sit down and talk with them.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.460]   But more and more, I could tell that people were being offended, but they had to eat,
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.120]   so they would put up with it.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.960]   Or they would stay away from the preaching, and then they would come and get the food
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.920]   later.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.360]   This is exactly what this section is talking about.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:20.400]   When you're in the position to be able to give, and you're domineering and you're abusing
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.680]   the position that you're in, and he's warning against that.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.280]   Verse 15 and 16, "Prohibit unjust legal actions.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.160]   You shall do no injustice in judgment.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:38.480]   You shall not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great, but you are to judge your neighbors
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.600]   fairly.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.140]   You shall not go about as a slander among your people, and you are not to act against
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.140]   the life of your neighbor.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.000]   I am the Lord your God."
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.240]   So this is about unjust legal action.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:54.280]   Verse 15 addresses those charged with responsibility of deciding cases that they don't, again,
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.520]   use their position to be unfair.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.280]   Verse 14, 16, "Deals with witnesses who may be tempted to pervert justice by slandering
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.520]   people, causing damage to their life.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.000]   Right testimony was crucial during this time to carry out justice."
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.320]   This is before videotapes.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.800]   This is before cameras, right?
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.640]   And so an eyewitness, if he chose to say something and completely ruin somebody's life, and again,
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.800]   it is to prevent all of that, okay?
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:26.520]   Again, let me just reiterate, all of this, when you study it individually, it's so tedious,
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.280]   30 separate commands, just rapid fire.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.080]   But again, don't forget the big picture, right?
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:39.280]   He's talking about a holy community, and holy community is not just a community who does
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.160]   not do perverted things, right?
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.640]   We talked about that in chapter 18.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.120]   Cultural immorality, like God wants us to be holy, and he's telling us that you shall
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:55.560]   not do this, you shall not do this, but in chapter 19, right, he's building a community
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.280]   of grace and love, right?
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.920]   And fairness, and righteousness, and justice.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:06.120]   Ultimately, this is what God is going to restore in heaven.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:11.260]   What we have now, what everything that he's saying here is a picture of what God desires
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.860]   in his community.
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.080]   To us, in the new covenant, the church.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:19.480]   In the old covenant, obviously, he desires a nation of Israel, right?
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:26.400]   So we experience it now in part, but all of this will be experienced and be glorified
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:33.280]   in the new covenant.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.920]   Verses 17 and 18 teach the Israelites how to respond when wronged.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.340]   You shall not hate your fellow countrymen in your heart.
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:44.560]   You may surely reprove your neighbor, but shall not incur sin because of him.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:50.920]   In other words, if you've been wronged, you can try to correct that by confronting him
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.400]   and talking to him, but do not sin.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.720]   You shall not take vengeance nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people, but
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.680]   you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.760]   I am the Lord.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.640]   That's where that commandment comes from.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:08.000]   Love God, love your neighbor as yourself, right?
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.800]   This is the Old Testament.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.180]   This is not Jesus in the New Testament.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.480]   This is God saying that.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:21.340]   What Jesus was saying was repeating of this.
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.880]   So again, I mean, he doesn't just say love your neighbor.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.480]   He describes what it looks like, right?
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.360]   When Jesus said, "Love God and love your neighbor as yourself," like, "Well, what does that
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.360]   look like?"
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.560]   Well, he tells you, chapter 19, right?
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.920]   "Well, who's my neighbor?"
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.640]   Chapter 19.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.880]   So next time you go back to that passage and somebody asks that question, read chapter
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.360]   19 because he describes it, right?
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:59.360]   Again, they are allowed to rebuke for the sake of restoration, but ultimately to love.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:04.400]   Verse 19, "Prohibits attempt to breed and fertilize across categories."
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.280]   On the surface, this is one of the strangest things.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:16.860]   You can't wear material with two separate materials woven together, right?
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:23.600]   The meaning behind this is not 100% sure, but most scholars believe that the breeding
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:31.320]   of animals had to do with some sort of a cultic idol worship and the weaving of two materials.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:39.160]   It's found in Exodus chapter 28, 6 through 8, where it says that the only garment that
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:44.600]   was allowed in the nation of Israel that was able to have two separate materials woven
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.040]   together was the priestly garment, right?
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:55.840]   So God is prohibiting the nation of Israel to separate the servants of God who are priests
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.960]   who are allowed to come into the tabernacle versus those who are not, right?
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.640]   So again, no one knows that for 100%, but to me it makes the most sense.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.960]   The reason why he gives that command is to separate from the common and uncommon through
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.960]   those materials.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:19.560]   Again, for the priest to be set apart.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:27.560]   In this section, I'm going to go pretty rapidly.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:32.320]   You got it?
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.000]   So verses 20 to 22 gives guidelines on how to deal with a man who had sexual relations
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.080]   with a female slave.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.760]   They are not to be put to death if she was a slave.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.560]   If he is to bring a guilt offering for violating someone else's slave.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:51.600]   Again, let me just summarize real quick.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.120]   Basically a slave was considered property.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:02.840]   So if the slave girl was betrothed to be married and a man comes in and violates her, basically
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.720]   he's committed adultery.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:10.040]   And so committing adultery requires putting up death, right?
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.760]   If she was not betrothed and if she is violated, she is considered property.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:24.960]   So therefore, the restitution for what happened is the guilt offering as mentioned in the
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.760]   beginning of the book of Leviticus.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.440]   Do you understand the rationale?
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.720]   I'm not saying it makes sense, but do you understand what it's saying here?
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.640]   The distinction.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.040]   Again, not a single nod.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.640]   Do you understand the distinction between the two?
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.920]   Because she was considered property.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.440]   Now I'm not explaining is that fair, is that not fair, why is that okay, why is it not
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.440]   okay?
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:56.280]   I'm just explaining what he is saying, distinguishing between when is it adultery and when is it
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.320]   a violation of someone's property.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.600]   So if it is an adultery, then the man is put to death.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:10.160]   If it is a violation of someone's property, she needs to be compensated.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.880]   I'm not going to explain that.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:20.760]   I want you to talk about it in your groups.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.640]   You're probably frustrated now, but pay attention.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:29.120]   Verses 23 to 25 teach how to behave in the Canaanite land as it pertains to fruits from
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.680]   trees they planted.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:36.920]   You notice in verse 23 to 25, "When you enter the land and plant all kinds of trees for
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.000]   food, then you shall count their fruit as forbidden.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.920]   Three years it shall be forbidden to you, it shall not be eaten.
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.660]   But in the fourth year, all its fruit shall be holy, an offering of praise to the Lord.
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:53.280]   In the fifth year, you are to eat of its fruit that its yield may increase for you.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.040]   I am the Lord your God."
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:01.960]   So he says when you go into the promised land, first year you plant, first three years that
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.640]   you plant, they are not to eat it.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:10.200]   Fourth year, it's to be offered to the Lord as an offering.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:15.440]   And on the fifth year, whatever fruits come out on the fifth year, you are free to eat.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.180]   You understand that?
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:24.440]   To explain, when they go into the promised land, the first three years, he's not saying
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.180]   let the fruit grow and then just dry up and die.
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:33.920]   What do you think is the reasoning behind why for the first three years?
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:40.240]   And what are they supposed to be doing?
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.640]   For the purpose of pruning, to strengthen.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:51.580]   That before you begin to enjoy its fruit, to take time to cultivate and to prune.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.280]   That's what the first three years are for.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.920]   Not to abuse the land, not to abuse the fruits.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.800]   Wait till it's time.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.540]   That's what it's talking about.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:07.440]   And then when it is time to enjoy it, before you enjoy it, you give it to the Lord.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.760]   That's the fourth year.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:17.520]   And then the fifth year, after you have cultivated the fruit, after you have offered it to the
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.680]   Lord, then you can enjoy it yourself.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.240]   And that's the principle that he told the nation of Israel when they go into the promised
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.240]   land.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:29.160]   Now what does this signify?
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:34.860]   Now remember we talked about that, that when Adam and Eve fell, what fell with Adam and
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:38.820]   Eve?
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.620]   The land.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:42.900]   The land also is corrupt.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.180]   Remember we talked about that in the book of Romans?
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:49.360]   How creation eagerly waits for the sons of God to be revealed.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:55.420]   And then how when we get to the book of Revelation, there's going to be a restoration of the earth.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:38:00.640]   So along with the fall of Adam and Eve, so did creation.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:09.100]   And so part of redemption, redemption of mankind, is tied to the land.
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:14.160]   And the final glorification is also going to see the land also be restored.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:20.020]   So the principle here, again, it's not just the restoration of mankind, but just general
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.680]   principle.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:28.960]   I might be milking it, but I see a clear, to me, I see this pointing to something very
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.280]   important in the New Testament.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.200]   Do you see it?
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.280]   Or is it just me?
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.560]   Maybe I was staring at this too long.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.280]   Maybe somebody in this room thinks like me.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:48.160]   Do you see?
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:56.520]   I see justification, sanctification, glorification.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.080]   For the sake of time, I'm not going to go into it.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.880]   You can make the connection and I'll try to explain more later if you come and talk to
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.400]   me later.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:15.440]   But I see justification, the initiation, and the cultivation, regeneration, repentance.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:23.900]   And then I see sanctification, dedication, declaration.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:31.080]   And then I see glorification, where we're seeing the final fruit of our salvation.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.000]   I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   I was staring at it for a long time today, and that's what it seemed to point to, to
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.160]   me.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:46.040]   Verses 26 through 28, again, prohibition against a series of pagan practices.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:53.120]   This is where you get, "Do not tattoo yourself."
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:40:00.120]   So if you have tattoos, you are in violation of verse 27 and 28.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.760]   I see you.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.520]   Now obviously here, when he's talking about a prohibition against tattooing, it is connected
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.920]   to the cultic worship.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.120]   Obviously that's not why people do it today, so it is not the same.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:21.480]   But there are people today who will take this literally and will not practice this.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.280]   I am neither condoning it or saying it's okay.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:36.600]   But it is not a direct connection to what we see being done today.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:43.120]   Verse 29, prohibits offering their daughters as prostitutes, and by doing so, defiling
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.120]   the land.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:49.360]   So remember, we pointed that out last time, how what defiles a man also defiles the land
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:53.120]   that he is on.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:57.680]   Verse 30 is a calling to keep the Sabbath and to revere God's sanctuary.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.760]   Not only the Sabbath, but to keep the sanctuary, revere it.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:08.240]   Verse 31, prohibits Israel from going to those who perform divination.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:12.960]   A medium is one who conjures up spirits, who speaks to the dead.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:19.400]   A spiritist is one who communicates to the dead for the sake of power.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:25.640]   So it may sound similar, but the difference is a medium is the one who is just for the
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.880]   purpose of talking and getting information.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.920]   A spiritist is the one who is trying to get the power of the dead.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:40.160]   And he says that this is an abomination to God.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:47.840]   So I was just kind of thinking about that, like how many games that we play, and when
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:54.680]   I say we, I'm talking about just people in general, that play on this thought, idea,
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:42:00.480]   even if it's just a game of conjuring up spirits.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.480]   I don't know the games.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.480]   I became a Christian early on enough and I was never into these games, but I remember
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:13.040]   hearing pockets of things, and if I mention it, I know some of you guys will already know.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.360]   Magic?
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.980]   You don't know?
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:20.040]   Maybe it's a previous generation, some of you guys may or may not play.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:28.640]   Again, tell me if I'm wrong, but it was explained to me that it was casting spells and spirits.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   No?
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.600]   Yeah, okay, so you don't know.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.600]   All right, whatever.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:41.160]   But there are games where you play, whether it's the Ouija board or magic or, I don't
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.720]   know, Dungeons and Dragons like that?
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.720]   I don't know.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.320]   I don't know these games.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.320]   Oh, yes?
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.320]   No?
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:57.480]   Okay, but I got saved in a charismatic circle where this was very sensitive, right?
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.920]   We didn't play around with this, but that has nothing to do with being charismatic or
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.920]   not charismatic, right?
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:10.680]   I think Christians need to be more discerning of what we are entertained by and what we
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.960]   allow, right?
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:17.000]   I'm not saying that these are things you can't do and these are things you can do, but if
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:23.200]   it is an abomination to the Lord and it is messing around with the spirit world, even
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:28.600]   as a joke, even as a game, we shouldn't do it, right?
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.080]   Yes, right?
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.400]   I'm not asking for your opinion.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:37.560]   I'm telling you, yeah, you shouldn't do it, right?
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:46.760]   Because it is, even as a game to call up spirits to cast spells on people, this is not a joke
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:54.080]   because that's the real world, right?
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.000]   Verse 32 calls Israel to show respect for the elderly.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.440]   So let me read that.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:04.000]   You shall rise up before the gray-headed and honor the age and you shall reveal your God,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.360]   I am the Lord.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:13.240]   Now why is honoring the elderly revering the Lord, right?
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:17.920]   Because if we don't know how to honor the people who are right above us, how do we honor
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.240]   a God who is way above us, right?
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:27.120]   Usually somebody who can't handle authority usually has a problem with the authority that's
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.560]   closest to them, right?
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.960]   They don't shake their fists at God.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:32.960]   God's too far.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.060]   They usually shake their fists at whoever is right above them.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.760]   That could be your husband.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.360]   It could be your parents.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.640]   It could be, you know, like a manager, right?
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.720]   It could be the police officer, right?
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.840]   Typically when we have a rebellious heart and we have a problem with submission, it
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:55.880]   usually is shown with whoever is right above, whoever is nearest to us.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:03.940]   He says honoring the gray-headed, right, honoring elders is a way of revering God.
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:07.080]   So when we talk about submission to God, we say, "Oh, I submit to God.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.240]   I'm a follower of Jesus Christ."
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:18.240]   Typically, the way the rubber meets the road is whoever is nearest to you, right?
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.800]   And he said, again, so he says respecting elders is a way to respect God.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:31.520]   I'm going through it real quick.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:37.160]   Again, 33 and 34 teach us not to mistreat aliens in the land, verse 33 and 34.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:42.100]   When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong.
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:46.360]   The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.480]   love him as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.820]   I am the Lord your God.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:58.960]   This is God teaching his nation to be kind to aliens, right?
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:04.120]   I mean, and all of this is what was lost at the fall.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.920]   And he says, "Be holy, for I am holy."
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.600]   This is part of it, right?
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.600]   Love them.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:14.240]   Strangers, people who can't possibly pay you back, right?
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.520]   People who are not your family, they can't pay you back.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.480]   There's no reason to do it because they're strangers, they're aliens, they're just passing
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.480]   by.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.480]   But he says, "Be kind to them.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.480]   Be neighborly.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.480]   Be hospitable."
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.480]   Right?
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   This is our God.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:31.440]   So everything that we see of the kindness and grace and mercy of God in the New Testament,
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:35.240]   it's because he's the God of the Old Testament.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:42.320]   He said, "Treat them as if they were our own."
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:46.480]   I think every religion calls people to be kind, right?
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.440]   At least most of them.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.400]   But you cannot compare, right?
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:58.060]   It's one thing for God to say, you know, "Love your neighbor, love your family, but love
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:02.440]   your enemies," right?
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:07.100]   That is not something that our world can even understand.
[00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.440]   And yet that is not a New Testament concept.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:19.560]   That's an Old Testament concept.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:23.640]   And then finally, one more.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.840]   35 to 36 teaches us to be honest in doing business, to wait.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:34.000]   So he keeps saying, "Just balances, just waits, just ephah, and just hymn," right?
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.960]   To be righteous in all that we are doing, right?
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.400]   And this is what he means to be holy, to be set apart.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:49.520]   That the people of God, the nation of Israel, the church is to be set apart in our grace,
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:56.480]   set apart in our integrity, right, set apart in our mercy, set apart in generosity, right?
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:01.640]   Set apart in not taking vengeance, set apart in turning the other cheek, set apart in being
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:07.600]   concerned for the poor, set apart by being generous, right?
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.080]   So that's what he says.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:12.620]   When he says to be holy is to be unlike the world.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:17.560]   Everybody else in the world will give a little bit, right?
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:23.040]   They live their life, you know, like selfishly self-focused, and then when they have abundance,
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.780]   they give a little bit, right?
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.300]   So everybody practices some generosity.
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.640]   Everybody practices some compassion.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:37.080]   Christians are called to deny ourselves and live for God, meaning to live for other people,
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.500]   right?
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.600]   That's what it means to be God-centered.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.820]   To be God-centered means to be other-centered.
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.160]   How are you God-centered?
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.040]   On church, you're God-centered because we worship God.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.720]   Outside the church, we're God-centered because we're other-centered.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.520]   That's what sets us apart from the world, that we are no longer pursuing our glory,
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:59.520]   our safety, right, our retirement.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:07.160]   Our goal as Christians is to ultimately glorify God by loving others first, right?
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:13.480]   That's what he means in chapter 19 by being holy, not simply not watching movies and not,
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.180]   you know, being hooked on pornography.
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:19.360]   That's the prohibition side, right?
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:24.760]   But this side of it, in his grace and his mercy, we are to be different than the world,
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.020]   okay?
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:32.200]   So verse 37, the concluding remarks, "You shall thus observe all my statues and all
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.800]   my ordinances and do them, I am the Lord," right?
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.960]   You're not to pick and choose some of this, right?
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:41.840]   You're not to pick, "Well, I can do the first part, but I can't do the second part, and
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:45.680]   I do, I can obey the three commandments, but the other seven commandments is not for me."
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.560]   He said, "All of them," right?
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:53.960]   This is what it means to be a follower of Christ, a worshiper of God.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:58.400]   So the three questions I have for you tonight, have you ever considered holiness and compassion
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.920]   to be of the same?
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.100]   In what area of holiness do you struggle the most?
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:07.320]   And I want you to include both chapter 18 and 19 in this, right?
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.720]   Because both is talking about holiness.
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:14.580]   How much time, effort, and even money do you think you deliberately allocate for the purpose
[00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:16.040]   of serving the needs of others?
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:19.300]   Now, some of you guys are just generous by nature, right?
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:23.700]   Some of you guys are just kind and giving every time by nature.
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:28.160]   But the question that I'm asking, number two, is how much of it is deliberate planning,
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.160]   right?
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:36.760]   That you plan to live your life for other people, for God's glory, right?
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.480]   How much of that is deliberate?
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:42.960]   Or do you just end up using your time and money for yourself until there's an opportunity,
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.680]   and then you give some, right?
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:47.940]   And there's nothing wrong with that, right?
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:51.440]   But you can live a self-centered life and give a little money.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.800]   You can live a self-centered life and then be compassionate, right?
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.660]   But we're not talking about that.
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:02.460]   We're talking about a life centered around glorifying God by living other-centered, right?
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:07.320]   How much of your time, money, and effort is deliberately for that purpose?
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.080]   Third, how do you respond when you think you are wronged?
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.080]   Do you tend to react?
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.720]   Do you tend to make efforts to reconcile?
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.420]   Or do you have a tendency to sweep it under the rug, right?
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:23.160]   And this is, again, because it's mentioned in chapter 19, all right?
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:33.240]   So let me pray for us, and then I'll give you time for your small group.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:36.120]   Heavenly Father, we thank you again for your word.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:42.680]   We pray, Father God, that all that we have studied in chapter 19 would take its root
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.160]   in our hearts and in our minds.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:49.880]   And I pray that in our discussion, help us, Lord God, to be open and vulnerable, that
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.880]   in our weakness that we may find strength in Christ.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.160]   So we pray for your blessing and your Holy Spirit to guide us.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.760]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
