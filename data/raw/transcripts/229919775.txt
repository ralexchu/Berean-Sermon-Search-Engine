[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [TV static]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   This is CNN breaking news.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Have you seen this man?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   We are proud to announce that Peter Kim,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   a former Samsung user,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   who was notorious for taking terrible selfies,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   has finally improved at a genuine iPhone.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Now he can confidently take pictures
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   and selfies at any beret event.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   And that's why Apple doesn't advance it.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   [TV static]
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   [TV static]
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Last time on Adventures of Spork and Gorg.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Spork was plugged into a docking system,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   forgetting her mission to spread the gospel,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   while nemesis of Genesis betrayed Mrs. Samsung.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Meanwhile, Captain Gorg tried to wake up Spork.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Spork, what's up?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Come on.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Oh my gosh, Gorg.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   The weirdest thing happened when I was synced in.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   I was like forgetting who I was
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   and what I was supposed to be doing.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I just really want to go home.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Wait, we still need to spread the gospel.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Maybe we can sync the information into the other iTunes.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   I have my Bible app, and we can install it for them.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I feel like God is calling us to stay here
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   and reach outside to us.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I mean, I guess it doesn't matter to me.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   We might as well try, right?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Do or do not. There is no try.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I think we should just go home. It's safer there.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   You can just spread the gospel there.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Dear God, I know that you love me
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   even when I make wrong choices.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   There are so many things that I'd rather do
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   than trust in you and follow your word,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   but I know that you are a God of the visible and the invisible,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   so help me to trust you more. Amen.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Everyone, let's pray to help Spork.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Repeat after me.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   God loves you.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Even if you do wrong.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   God loves you.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Even if you do wrong.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Thanks, Pastor Spork, for all you guys.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I feel so much better, and I think I can trust in God more.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   As Spork prayed, or after Spork prayed,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   God told her to go spread the gospel to new nations.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   So, Spork and Kork boarded the ship.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And Spork and Kork decided to go back home,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   but little did Spork and Kork know
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   that the nemesis of Genesis was also on their ship,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   plotting to sabotage their mission.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   [Music]
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   [Music]
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Now, all I have to do is hop their ship
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   so they're going to get hit by asteroids.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   What's going on with our ship?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I don't know, but it's not steering.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Kids, throw your asteroids on stage.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   [Laughter]
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Get us out of here!
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Use that one thing. What's it called?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Use the Force!
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Do it! You didn't do it, Dad!
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   You didn't do it, Mom!
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Use the Force!
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Help us, Jesus!
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You're our only hope!
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   After they prayed, Spork and Kork crashed onto a new planet.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Thank you, God, for saving us.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Yeah, thanks for destroying that last asteroid right at the last second.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Seriously, we can only see what's visible,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   but God always reveals more than what we can see.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And after that, Spork and Captain Kork
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   landed on the harsh desert of Tatooine.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Tatooine!
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Tatooine!
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Where are we?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   It looks like we've landed on...
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Tatooine.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   What are those?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I don't know, but I think--
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   First things first, I'm fearless!
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I'm the meanest in the world, yeah!
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And I'm all up in shaky business,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I'm gonna beat you down, 'cause I'm really the meanest, uh!
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   J-A-B-B-A, put my name in the--
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Attack!
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   [screaming]
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I'll join! I'll join! Help me!
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Join our forces.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Yes, where's the food?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   [evil laugh]
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Good job, Jabba! I knew your minions would do my bidding.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Good thing I texted you.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   You are evil. You are definitely evil.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   [evil laugh]
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   But what are you going to do to me?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Your lack of faith is disturbing.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   You will never, ever be able to share the gospel again.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   No! I don't want to!
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   [evil laugh]
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And muhahaha, they did it.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Will a Corgi's fork escape the hands of Jabba and Nemesis?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Will Pastor Peter buy another iPhone?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Come tomorrow to find out on the Adventure Zone.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Corgis for more!
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   [applause]
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   [screaming]
