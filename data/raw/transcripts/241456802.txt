[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.200]   If you would, take your Bibles and turn to Colossians chapter 3, verses 8 through 15.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:24.720]   Today we're going to be speaking about a specific topic, and that topic is going to be unity.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.280]   This passage reads like this, "But now you must put them all away, anger, wrath, malice,
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.520]   slander, obscene talk from your mouth.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.840]   Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.800]   and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.160]   creator.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.000]   Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised, uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.160]   free, but Christ is all and in all.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.560]   Put on then as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.480]   meekness and patience, bearing with one another, and if anyone has a complaint against another,
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.560]   forgiving each other as the Lord has forgiven you.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.100]   So you also must forgive.
[00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.920]   And above all these, put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.720]   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body,
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.760]   and be thankful."
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.160]   Let's go before the Lord in prayer.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.720]   Father, we ask that as your spirit has been working in our lives, that you would continue
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.320]   to work to renew our minds and transform our hearts, particularly as we think about the
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.400]   unity that you desire amongst your people, your household, your church.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.740]   I pray, Father God, that it would be our endeavor and our desire to strive for genuine unity
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.740]   within our church, Lord.
[00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.520]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.720]   Amen.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.720]   So our youth group is joining us in service today.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.120]   And in our youth group for the last month, we have been talking about the topic of unity.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.400]   We've been discussing this statement.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.840]   It's a little bit long, but it reads like this.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.640]   We must strive for unity in faith in Christ, in like-mindedness, in love, in purpose, in
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:22.080]   commitment, in shared life, producing joy, edification, and glory to Christ.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.400]   That's one long sentence.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.320]   I made it up myself.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.040]   Part of the reason why it's like that, though, is not because I was trying to imitate some
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.880]   Puritan or something, but because as I was studying the topic with the high school students,
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.000]   I realized there is so much to say from the scriptures.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.560]   The scriptures have so much to say in terms of God's desire for unity, the context of
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.320]   unity, how that unity is supposed to come about, what purpose is that unity supposed
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.920]   to serve, how God is going to use that for His kingdom, and more.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.960]   And that's why the sentence is long.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.800]   Now, for our purposes for today, since I'm not doing a series through it, we're going
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.160]   to be talking about only two elements of that statement, which is simply that we must strive
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.560]   for unity in faith and in love, in faith and in love.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.080]   See, our youth group is small.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.480]   For those of you guys who don't know, grand total, including our teachers, is about 19
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.240]   students, sometimes 20, right?
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.560]   And that being the case, I love it.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.800]   It's cozy, you know?
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.280]   When we get together, we can fit in one room.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.680]   We can be really familiar with how, you know, what's going on in their lives, and there's
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.680]   a ready kind of sentiment of just, "Hey, we're close."
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.760]   But it would be naive of me to think, just because we fit into one room, that we have
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.760]   genuine unity?
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.200]   Because there's familiarity and proximity, does that equate to unity?
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.320]   No, it doesn't.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.480]   And I would be naive to think that since our youth group is small, "Hey, we're not going
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.480]   to have this drama, and we're not going to have major conflict, and that there would
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.920]   be no resentment, discord, and any kind of division, even within our small group, or
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.680]   within our youth group, right?"
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.880]   No, we're all susceptible to that.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.200]   Absolutely are.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   Now, I'm really thankful because our youth group is awesome, and we don't have major
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   drama.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.120]   We don't have people fighting each other and stuff like that.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.000]   Half of them are related, you know?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.480]   It's awesome, right?
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.000]   Now, even then, though, even then, though, I would be naive to think, just because we
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.880]   don't have major problems, that we don't have temptations to feel apathy towards one another?
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.400]   That even just because we don't have major drama, that there's distance, that there isn't
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.460]   a sense of genuine unity?
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.320]   And so, one of the things I want to talk about is there are times when I can just think,
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.320]   like, "It's just cute.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.320]   They're hanging out.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.320]   They're jamming together.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.320]   They're talking and stuff.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.320]   Unity.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.320]   Boom."
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.800]   But I believe the Scripture challenges us to a higher standard of unity, amen?
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.640]   And thinking about the broader context of the broader church, we, too, are susceptible
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.720]   to the same challenges, namely because our church has been growing in multiple fashions,
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.960]   growing in breadth and in number, growing in depth of relationships, growing in proximity
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.760]   and closeness, growing in also differences, growing in so many fashions.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.040]   And so, we can, too, be susceptible to different kinds of disunity and division.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.040]   It's natural, right?
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.320]   It's a natural process of growing together.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.440]   But as we then grow, we have to ask this challenging question, "To what standard of unity are
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.740]   we supposed to strive?
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.360]   To what expectation does God have?"
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.520]   And as I've been studying this topic with the youth group for the last month, I have
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.480]   been personally challenged, "My goodness, God's vision for the unity of the church,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:54.440]   the body, far surpasses my expectation, far surpasses the standard of my own."
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.480]   And so, we're going to take some time to think about that.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.840]   What is the standard of God?
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.480]   What is His vision?
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.760]   And so, what I'm going to show you is by sequence of level.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.880]   The first level, level 100, is harmony and peace, okay?
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.880]   What do I mean by this?
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.920]   Let's take a look at this passage, Romans 12, verse 14 through 19.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.240]   "Bless those who persecute you.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.280]   Bless and do not curse them.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.440]   Rejoice with those who rejoice.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.800]   Weep with those who weep.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.560]   Live in harmony with one another."
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.560]   There's our command.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.480]   "Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.080]   Never be wise in your own sight.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.320]   Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.920]   If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.480]   Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.840]   'Vengeance is mine, I will repay,' says the Lord."
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.320]   So, in this vision, how would you vision it in the church?
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.720]   If you would with me, just picture two guys, you know, they get into a little bit of conflict
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.240]   and scuff, they say some hurtful words to each other, but now they have to resolve.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.560]   To apply this, they would say, "Ugh, I want to do one of these, 'What's wrong with you,
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   man?'
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.560]   But you know what?
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.560]   We're cool.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.920]   I got no beef against you, man."
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.200]   And the other guy's like, "Yeah, dude, we're cool.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   I'm not going to try to hurt you or nothing.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.200]   We're in the same church."
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   Right?
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.400]   That kind of stuff can happen.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.200]   Two people get in strife and they say to each other, "Hey, bygones be bygones, let's be
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.560]   peace."
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.920]   The reason why I say this is level 100 is because harmony and peace are good.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:33.320]   Unfortunately, the conception typically is peace equates to no conflict.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.160]   Peace means no war, right?
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.360]   There's no residual revenge.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.320]   We're going to try to humble ourselves and not fight each other.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.480]   That could be one way of harmony, right?
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.760]   But again, this is level 100.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.520]   This is good, proper.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.600]   We should calm those odd sentiments of wanting to react or whatever it may be, but there's
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.880]   more.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.880]   Level 300.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.720]   I'm going to skip because it levels up pretty fast, okay?
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.040]   Level 300.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.640]   This standard of God, this vision of God for unity, I'm going to call the unity of calling
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.640]   or identity.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.640]   What do I mean by this?
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.560]   Let's take a look at Ephesians 4, verse 1 through 4.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.880]   "I therefore, a prisoner of the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.360]   to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:31.320]   one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace."
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.840]   There's our challenge right there.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.020]   Be eager to maintain this unity.
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:41.900]   But I love the second part because there's this mounting, emphatic idea of where this
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.140]   unity comes from.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:48.660]   It says, "There is one body, one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope that belongs
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:54.420]   to your call, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.540]   and through all and in all."
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.780]   So you see where the repetition of the terms of you're called for this.
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.180]   You're in one baptism.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.220]   You have one Lord.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.620]   So what is God's picture of this unity?
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:15.420]   Well, if you couldn't picture this with me, imagine this amazing, inspiring coach, football
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:21.460]   coach, and he's rallying his troops, his football players together, and they're in this big
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.620]   old huddle.
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.380]   And the coach starts going off, and he's, "You were made for this.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.900]   You're one team.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.800]   You got one same jersey representing the same town.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.100]   You got one goal."
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.460]   And all the players come together and like, "Yeah!"
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.380]   That's kind of how it should be, I think.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:44.420]   I'm picturing it like that in my head, that the church comes together, and if we had,
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:49.060]   so to speak, this coach saying, "You got one body, one Spirit, one calling.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.460]   God has called you to his purpose.
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.460]   You're representing one Lord."
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.820]   And all the church people are like, "Yeah!"
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.420]   Because we're one team.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.420]   This is who we are.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.020]   I know that's kind of funny, but in some sense, that is, right?
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.020]   We are one team.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.020]   That's our identity.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.300]   This is our calling.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:11.580]   And there's an absolute, just as there is an awesome, awesome sense of fellowship and
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:17.460]   partnership in sports teams, there should be even that much more to those who are called
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.900]   by the name of Christ, right?
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.180]   Those who are called by the name of Christ, the one team, the one family of God.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:30.060]   So this is why I was saying, man, this is leveling up really fast in terms of the picture,
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.900]   God's picture of the unity we should exhibit within our church.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:39.780]   The next one is closely tied with it, so we'll call it 350, okay?
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:44.580]   Level 350 in God's vision and standard for the unity, which is for the church, is the
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.740]   unity by Christ's identity, okay?
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.580]   Unity by Christ's identity.
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.660]   What do I mean by this?
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.580]   We're going to take a look at a few verses here.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:59.700]   First, we're going to look at this passage in 1 Corinthians 1, verses 10 through 13.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:05.420]   Apostle Paul says, "I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:13.540]   you all agree that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.340]   and same judgment.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.060]   For it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is quarreling among you,
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.060]   my brothers."
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.980]   What I mean is each one of you says, "I follow Paul, I follow Apollos, and I follow Cephas,
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.500]   for I follow Christ."
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.100]   His question is, "Is Christ divided?"
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.060]   So there are a couple of things I've underlined and bolded for you.
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:40.260]   There is this idea of having the same mind, and in learning that there is division, Apostle
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.420]   Paul's counter-argument is, "Look at Jesus.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.420]   Is he divided?"
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.840]   And so therefore, we're thinking on the level of Christ's mind and Christ's body.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.340]   He is singular.
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.660]   He's not an individual with conflict of like, "I really want this personal thing, but God
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.700]   wants this," and he has conflict of internal desires.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.000]   He is singular.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.340]   And in so much as he is singular and whole, we should be.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.740]   Here's another passage I want to point to you.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.660]   Philippians chapter 2.
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:13.140]   So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.360]   the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.700]   same love, being in full accord and of one mind.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.580]   Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.580]   than yourself.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.940]   Let each of you look not only to his own interest, but also the interest of others.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.780]   Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.300]   Now for the sake of time, I'm not going to read the rest of it, but he's going to explain
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:48.500]   this was the mind of Christ who emptied himself for you.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.500]   So what am I saying?
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:55.740]   We're talking the vision of standard to what degree of unity does God want, to the degree
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:01.100]   that Christ's mind and his body and his character is whole.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:06.720]   That should be the benchmark of our collective minds being together.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.220]   This really does challenge like the kind of social norm of the day.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.300]   Going to be honest, I feel like what's cool and in in our generation is to think different.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.300]   Like I want to be different.
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.780]   I'm going to be different for the purpose of being different.
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:25.500]   So I'm going to be your devil's advocate and always argue with you.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.700]   That's not cool.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.740]   That's pointless.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.420]   These passages that I read actually say I want you to think the same.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.900]   Think the same of have same judgment, agree with each other, all of you.
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.460]   Now to some people they're like, "Oh, well, we shouldn't be mindless drones.
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.260]   We all think the same, feel the same, and judge the same, and we don't want to be all
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.260]   cultish."
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:55.260]   Well, to some degree, yes, the Bible does value, not to some degree, the Bible does
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.260]   value difference.
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.980]   First Corinthians 12.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.980]   We're all one.
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.020]   He gives a long, lengthy explanation.
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.860]   We're all one, but we're different members.
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.180]   So we're all feet, eyes, nose.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.300]   We're different, right?
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.140]   Valuing the difference.
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:16.780]   But at the same time, it is highlighting here that there should be a unity of the mind collectively.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:24.140]   And that degree of unity is the benchmark of Christ himself.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.420]   Leveling up, the next one.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.620]   The next level is level infinity.
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.620]   Level infinity.
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.620]   Why?
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.060]   Because as thinking about the standard of God in terms of the unity that he desires
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:41.380]   for this church, look at how he expresses it in John chapter 17, Jesus' prayer before
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.420]   God directly from Christ as he goes to the cross.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:52.500]   "The glory that you have given me, I have given to them, that they may be one even as
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.020]   we are one.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:59.020]   I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:05.940]   that you sent me and have loved them even as you loved me."
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.140]   So that's pretty mind-blowing.
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.220]   The unity that God is expressing.
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.940]   Of course, we're in progress.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.820]   Of course, we're in the journey of being perfected.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.060]   But he tells us the game plan in whole.
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:25.460]   That God desires such a unity as found between God the Father and God the Son.
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:31.260]   The Trinitarian unity that God experiences, the harmony, the perfect harmony is the kind
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.720]   of harmony that God desires for his church.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:41.140]   See how I was explaining to you when I started thinking about the concept of unity, it far
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.900]   surpasses my expectation.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:48.340]   It far surpasses what I'm okay with.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.500]   And that's my question to you.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:56.300]   Going through God's vision, God's perspective and expectation for the unity in the church,
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.260]   does it surpass what you're okay with?
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.620]   And so this is now an opportunity then for us to identify if there is any lack of unity
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:09.660]   with you and anybody, between the church, between groups, whatever it may be, this is
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.460]   the opportunity for us to say, "God desires more from us."
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.940]   And this is an opportunity for us to grow.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.200]   Amen?
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.920]   With that said, I want to highlight that the unity that then we're going to strive for
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.440]   is going to come by these two ways.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.440]   There's more.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.000]   Remember earlier I gave you that long sentence?
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.120]   There's a lot more, but we're going to highlight two.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:35.100]   The very first one is strive for unity in faith.
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.120]   Strive for unity in faith.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:42.520]   This is not profound, new information to you, but so good for us to review in here, that
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.280]   we have to strive for unity in the faith.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.240]   Galatians chapter 3, verses 26 and on.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.240]   This is what it says.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.760]   I think it's 25 and on.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.320]   "But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian."
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:02.120]   Meaning before was the law that was just supervising you, keeping you in check and restraining
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.120]   your sin.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.880]   But now faith has come, which has afforded us so much.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:14.080]   And then he goes on to say, "For in Christ Jesus, you're all sons of God through faith.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.520]   For as many of you who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ, there is neither
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.320]   Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male or female, for you
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.240]   are all one in Christ.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:31.800]   And if you are Christ, then you are Abraham's offering heirs according to promise."
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:37.200]   I want to remind us, the church, yes, is a social institution.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.880]   It's a social gathering, right?
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:47.400]   However, what supersedes everything about our social gathering is our faith.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.000]   There are sometimes temptations for us to desire that our gathering would be founded
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.440]   upon something aside from faith.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.840]   What do I mean by that?
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.280]   Things like friendship, things like, you know, the sense of community.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.720]   Those things are not bad.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   Those things are good.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.120]   The reality is we want to have friends here, you know?
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.600]   The reality is we want to have close relationships.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:15.140]   But there has to be the superseding foundation of faith, which is to you, your commonality
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.560]   with another individual that brings that sense of association, like, "You and I can relate.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.600]   Dude, I agree with you.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.960]   I share the same stuff.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.280]   Yes, there's a connection."
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.080]   That to you is your sense of bond.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.580]   Dude, we can really partner.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.200]   We could have this fellowship.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:37.160]   That to you also is a greater foundation of loyalty than just even friendships.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.920]   Your faith and your practice of your love for Christ is going to be so much greater
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.120]   in terms of the kindred spirit you have versus even what?
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.640]   Even your actual blood and flesh families, even more than your biological families to
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.640]   some degree.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.880]   So what am I saying?
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.440]   Let it be the foundation of faith that builds the community.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:05.240]   And let's not expect just because that, yes, this is a social institution, other things,
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.200]   other things to make us feel like we're connected.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.760]   And this is one thing that I would like to say too.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.200]   What we're seeing here then, because faith is the foundation of it all, faith is going
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:21.600]   to be the platform and the context by which we have the sense of unity, then if we see
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:29.200]   a lack of unity, if we see a lack of closeness in that bond, it's not a one-to-one correlation,
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.520]   but we have to ask, "Man, where is our faith?
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.320]   Where are our eyes right now?"
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:39.960]   Again, I'm not saying just because you don't have close relationships, therefore one-to-one
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.600]   you don't have faith or that you're not right with God.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:47.800]   However, if we see a lack of that sense of camaraderie, that sense of closeness and a
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:53.160]   desire to build those kind of like a good brotherly, sisterly relationships, then there
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.160]   is a question mark.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.760]   "What's going on?"
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.560]   And let that be an opportunity for us to examine where we are with the Lord, right?
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:06.280]   Because there is a sense to which if an individual has no interest and drive in the spiritual
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:12.280]   things of God, I can anticipate and expect that the bonds and loyalty and the friendships
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.440]   that they have in the church would also weaken, right?
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.000]   It goes hand in hand.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.520]   So again, just to summarize, we are making sure that our sense of bond and community
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.960]   is solely based on our faith in Christ.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:33.320]   And anytime we try to base it on anything else, we know we're going to fail.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.880]   Secondly, and this is where I want to spend the bulk of our time today.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.640]   I'm going to skip that one for now.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.200]   Strive for unity in love.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.800]   Strive for unity in love.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:49.240]   I'm going to reread to us the passage in Colossians chapter 3 verses.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.080]   I'm going to read from 12 to 15 this time.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:58.840]   It says this, "Put on then as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts,
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:03.960]   kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.200]   And if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other as the Lord has forgiven
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   you.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.240]   So you also must forgive.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:17.720]   And above all these, put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:23.120]   And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to which indeed you are called in one body.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.880]   And be thankful."
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.300]   I want to focus on this concept here.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.780]   It goes through a laundry list.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.240]   This is who you are, holy ones.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.000]   This is who you are, beloved ones.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.200]   This is what you need to put on.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:40.280]   And it gives you the laundry list of a compassionate heart, of kindness, of humility, meekness,
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.400]   and patience, bearing with one another and forgiving each other.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.600]   And then it ends with, "Above all these things."
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.640]   The reason why I want to focus on the concept of love is this passage is interesting.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.840]   Some of your translations say, "In addition to this, put more love on."
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.200]   The NASB says, "Above all these things," as in like, you know, more than this.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.680]   Another translation says, "In all these."
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.720]   The reason why is because there's a sense in which as he's describing this laundry list
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:15.840]   of character traits we should have, he's summarizing for us the culmination of these sentiments,
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:23.480]   desires, feelings, hard attitudes that will culminate to a genuine love.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.520]   Something that our Savior in Jesus Christ has modeled for us.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.520]   So rather than going down the list and saying, "Hey, this is what humility is.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.520]   This is what this is."
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.080]   I'm going to approach it a little bit different way and spend the bulk of our time here.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.520]   I want to talk about love.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.080]   And I don't want to just leave you today with, "Come on, people.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.320]   Let's just love one another," you know.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:48.000]   I want to dissect what are some elements of love that we have to exhibit towards one another
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.240]   to pursue the kind of unity that we just went over.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.920]   Here's the first.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:23:01.400]   The first element of love that I see in Scripture and in the model of our Savior is desire,
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.720]   right?
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.640]   Love categorically, not exhaustively, but categorically can be a desire.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.760]   And that's kind of actually typically the way that we use the word love.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.000]   I love chocolate, you know.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.080]   That's what I just want to eat it.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.200]   You're not saying, "So precious chocolate."
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.480]   You know, you're just, "I want it.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.480]   I want to take it."
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.320]   You know, "It's mine," kind of thing.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.680]   And that is in many ways we use that term.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.520]   To give an example of this, I Google searched.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:30.760]   I said, "I want to Google," and I did, "love, desire, love.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.520]   I want this," you know.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.200]   I just want to warn you, when you Google search stuff, be careful because a lot of bad stuff
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   comes out.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.920]   But when I Google searched love, I want something, right?
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:46.240]   This movie came out, and it was the movie The Notebook, which was a long time ago, 2004.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.440]   Some of you guys are already, like, giggling.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:56.100]   It's like a sappy love story, and it's just chock full of poor acting and romance.
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.160]   And Ryan Gosling is in that movie, and a lady named Rachel McAdams is in that movie.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.480]   Well, these two individuals, they have a love, but there's a conflict.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.240]   She has parents who expect her to, you know, marry the, like, handsome, rich man.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:13.400]   She clearly has an internal desire to like this guy who's, like, all shabby-looking,
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.880]   almost hobo-looking.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:20.080]   And the guy is all frustrated, you know, and his moment of frustration comes over to this
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.320]   girl, and then he says, "I know our relationship is horrible.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.080]   We fight all the time."
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.800]   And he looks at her, and he goes, "But I want you.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.640]   I want all of you, and I want all of you all the time."
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.800]   That was pretty much how he acted.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.880]   That was the best he did, okay?
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:43.880]   And then he goes, "What do you want?
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.600]   What do you want?
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.080]   What do you want?"
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.520]   And then, I haven't watched the movie, but I've watched that clip, okay?
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.640]   And then she goes, "It's not that easy."
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.880]   And then she, like, runs, "I have to go," and then she runs away, okay?
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:07.020]   And after I saw that, I was like, "Man, this is such a cheesy movie."
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:13.960]   But it so accurately depicts how our God loves us in the category of desiring us.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   Can I say something?
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.440]   We, ourselves, are sometimes in conflict of our desires.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.020]   We're a mixed bag of desires, honestly, right?
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.240]   We know the right things to do.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.360]   We have certain sentiments.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.760]   We are a mixed bag of desires.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.420]   Can we all acknowledge?
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.040]   God has never been confused about what he wants.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.080]   God has never been conflicted.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.020]   God has never been so unclear.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:40.080]   He has been absolutely explicit in his desire for his people.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.520]   The New Testament explains to us and says, "God has chosen you before the foundation
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.520]   of the world."
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.760]   As soon as Adam appears, that's good in my sight.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.880]   Abraham appears and says, "I choose you."
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.880]   I'm studying the book of Exodus.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.440]   In the book of Exodus, God says, "You're my people.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.880]   I'm your God."
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:02.080]   I show you a passage here at the last book of the Old Testament, Malachi chapter 3.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.600]   "They will be mine," says the Lord.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.920]   "And on the day that I prepare my own possession."
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:15.280]   God has been absolutely clear of his longing and desire.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.600]   It's just we sometimes, like, "It's not that easy."
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.600]   I'm going to be honest.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.520]   I'm going to go from different levels of relationships.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.800]   Between God, that clarity, that clarity of desire is our model.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.120]   In your relationships, whether it be husband and wife relationships, for marriage.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.480]   Congratulations, Sal, and Jen.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:42.520]   Got married yesterday.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.660]   Just speaking to newlyweds and you guys, too.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.440]   In the newlywed stage, a lot of times is when you have conflict of desire.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:55.400]   What's going to be a good, good practice for you is to clarify and purify your desire.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.600]   There's conflict when you start wanting, like, "Oh, but I really miss my single life and
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.480]   I want to go hang out with my friends, but I really want this, too."
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.200]   But when a man says, "No, I wanted this," right?
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.160]   I wanted to be a husband.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.760]   I wanted to be one.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.440]   I wanted to sacrifice my time.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.080]   I knew what I was getting to.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.640]   That's what I want.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.640]   Peace.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.640]   Unity.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.680]   But when we have conflicting desires, there's what?
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.680]   Life.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.680]   Is that not what James told us?
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.760]   You bicker and quarrel because you have no idea how to control your desires.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:33.200]   Now, by application here in the church, what kind of culture would we have if we truly
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.760]   just desired one another like the Lord desires us?
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.280]   Where we say, "Hey, this might be a little awkward, but we're at the same church.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.320]   I want to get to know you."
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.640]   Where we're not thinking, like, "I'm just tired.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.640]   I'm going to go home.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.440]   I want to come to a place where I can just easy come, easy go, and that's it."
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.160]   But rather, "I want to be with these people."
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.040]   I'm going to share with you a funny story.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.160]   This happened recently, and hopefully they're not in here.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.160]   Okay.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.440]   There was a guy that was church service.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.760]   I was super duper tired.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.240]   Then he came up to me and asked me, "Hey, do you want to go to coffee after?"
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.680]   I paused, and I said, "Oh, man.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.680]   I'm super tired."
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.000]   Honestly, it's been a long day.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.960]   Going to be honest, we kind of meet up pretty regularly, so I don't know if I want to.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.960]   I know what's going to happen.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.440]   If we're going to talk about girls, I don't have the patience for that today.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.760]   Then I realized I wasn't saying it out loud.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.280]   It was just all in my head.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.080]   The whole time, he's talking to me, but I was just staring at him.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:33.840]   Then he looked at me awkward and was like, "Do you want to go?"
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.080]   I feel like, "Dude, I was doing this thing with Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams."
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.080]   He's like, "Do you want to?"
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.560]   I'm like, "It's not that easy, man.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.560]   I'm tired."
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:47.520]   Well, from one introvert to if there's introverts out here, building community and relationships
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:53.080]   in the church is sometimes hard because there's desires in us, especially as an introvert,
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.800]   to protect my space, time, and energy.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   I have to challenge myself.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   What do I want, though?
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.440]   What do I want in here?
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.400]   I'm so challenged by the example of Christ, the example of our Heavenly Father.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.680]   I'm also challenged by examples of saints in the scripture in relation to, again, relationships
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.680]   within the church.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:15.040]   Remember Apostle Paul, where he so eagerly desired to go to people.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.160]   He goes, "Just say it explicitly.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.880]   I want to see you.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.440]   I miss you."
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.480]   I always get challenged by that story.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.880]   Apostle Paul took three successive mission trips.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   Remember?
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.480]   He was in the eastern part of Turkey, then he went all the way to the end of Turkey,
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.800]   and then he went into Europe.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.720]   When he was in Europe, Jesus told him, "Go to Rome."
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.720]   Apostle Paul said, "I'm going to Jerusalem."
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.840]   Why?
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.240]   Because he knew they were in need.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.320]   He was in Europe already.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.360]   He just had to go down to Rome.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.880]   But he wanted to take a love offering of finances and help, and he went all the way to Jerusalem
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.480]   to see them.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.640]   Because why?
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.480]   He desired them.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:59.320]   What a challenge for us to exhibit that kind of love, where our desire is for the people.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:04.560]   We would definitely then have an affected culture, too.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.960]   Next.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:12.360]   Next element of love that we exhibit for the sake of unity and pursuing unity is affection.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.920]   This is just simply the concept of treasuring.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.080]   This is simply the concept of being fond of.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:23.280]   This is the concept of saying, "Not only do I want something, but I see the value."
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.400]   It's precious in my sight.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.760]   I sometimes hear the conversations amongst the church, and I am so encouraged.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:34.440]   There are some of you guys who are absolutely vocal about how much you love the church.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.560]   Sometimes way too far.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.920]   But you'll say things like, "I love this church," and then you'll say, "It's the absolute best,
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.920]   and it's the only one."
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.600]   I'm like, "No, no, no, it's not the only church.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.000]   There are good churches everywhere."
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.080]   But I get the sentiment, and I'm encouraged by that.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.960]   And then some of you protect this church like it's your own family.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.400]   Someone just talked about, "How dare you say that about the church?"
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.240]   "Don't talk about my mom," kind of thing, the same attitude.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.480]   And then some of you love the church so much, "Let's move to Texas and live together on
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.480]   a ranch."
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.640]   I'm like, "Man, you're way too far.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.600]   Calm down."
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.640]   But when I hear that, I'm encouraged.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:15.200]   There is not the love of like, "I just want this," but there's a love of treasuring this,
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.800]   you know, treasuring what we have, being thankful.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.200]   And I do want to point to God's treasuring of His people as an example of that.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:30.040]   This is a passage I've preached on before, and it's just such a passage of immense, explicit
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.800]   expression of the love of God.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.240]   Please turn to Hosea chapter 11.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:48.240]   It's not on the screen because it's kind of long, but we're going to just read this together.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.600]   So Hosea chapter 11, we're going to go from verses 1 through 8.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:32:06.160]   And honestly, every time I read it, it's just heart-wrenching because God's so not in implicit
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.400]   fashion, not through story.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.120]   When Israel was a youth, I loved him.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.760]   And out of Egypt, I called my son.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.520]   The more they called him, the more they went from them.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.720]   They kept sacrificing to Baals and burning incense to idols.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.480]   Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:29.160]   I took them in my arms, but they did not know that I healed them.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.880]   I led them with cords of a man with bonds of love, and I became to them as one who lifts
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.760]   the yoke from their jaws.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.640]   I bent down and led them.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.000]   They will not return to the land of Egypt, but Assyria.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.120]   He will be their king because they refused to return to me.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.920]   The sword will whirl against their cities and will demolish their gate bars and consume
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.800]   them because of their counsels.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.200]   So my people are bent on turning from me, though they call them to the one on high,
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.600]   none at all exalts him.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:03.640]   So so far what you see is God saying, "I loved Israel like my son."
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.920]   Like when a baby needs help, when a youth, young child, teen needs help, I helped him,
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.920]   I aided him.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:12.960]   He just never recognized that, and he's always turning from me.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.120]   And then now he expresses his heart, though.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.340]   Verse 8, "But how can I give you up, O Ephraim?
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:23.000]   How can I surrender you, O Israel?
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.060]   How can I make you like Adma?
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.000]   How can I treat you like Zoboam?
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.880]   My heart is turned over within me.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.640]   All my compassions are kindled.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.840]   I will not execute my fierce anger.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.160]   I will not destroy Ephraim again, for I am God.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:43.000]   I am not a man, the holy one in your midst, and I will not come in wrath."
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.920]   What I hear saying is, "I'm not just one of you.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.360]   I'm their father.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.560]   So how can I give them up?"
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:58.840]   And in that I see God treasuring his people to a degree where his promises of, "I will
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:03.120]   never forsake you," is absolutely vibrant.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.120]   How amazing is that?
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:10.280]   But likewise, when it comes to our relationships, too, if we are to mature in the love of God
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.960]   and the love of Christ, we, too, have to have that kind of posture to cherish the people
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.700]   that we say we love.
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.480]   We have an option.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:25.140]   When people hurt you, when they disappoint you, when they let you down, you have options,
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.600]   some of them legitimate.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.600]   They hurt me.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.760]   Why would I put myself there?
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.160]   I'm not going to be around them anymore.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.160]   Why?
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.640]   I don't want to be hurt by you again.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.440]   If people annoy you, you might be thinking, "Dude, I don't want to be unsanctified.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.600]   I want to be sanctified, so I'm not going to come around you."
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.360]   Or you might even be thinking, "Dude, you hit me.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.680]   I get to hit you back because that's the law of the land."
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:52.680]   But even if we believe that to be legitimate, that is not in likeness of our God.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:57.480]   I love the fact that Apostle Paul, clearly, he's been let down by people.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.640]   He talks about how people deserted him.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.800]   He talks about how when he was beaten, no one was around.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.360]   But Apostle Paul talks about the church.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.520]   He says, "I love you like a mom.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.600]   I care for you like a dad.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:13.160]   And I would gladly work all day, work all night just to provide for you, just so that
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.880]   you don't think I'm doing this out of some kind of selfish motive."
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:24.400]   Likewise for us, we will understand people's love for us when we see that kind of affection.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.720]   And again, coming down to the idea of unity within the church, imagine the change of culture
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.920]   when we have that kind of, you know, the sight and eye of preciousness.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.920]   You know?
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.640]   When we look at our fellow congregation members and we don't think like, "Ugh, selfish people
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.640]   so fake."
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.600]   But we think like, "Oh, you're so cute.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.880]   You're so precious in my eyes.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.880]   You're adorable."
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.640]   And that could be weird, so don't do that verbally.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.000]   Think it in your head.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.400]   But I work with, you guys know I work with college a lot and I work with youth group
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.400]   a lot and they're in here.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.320]   You guys know I see you guys so cute.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.960]   When you guys are together and you're laughing and talking, I'm just like a dad and I'm like,
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:02.960]   "Oh, photos."
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.960]   You know?
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.960]   Like, that's what I do now, you know?
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.240]   Because you guys are precious in my eyes.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.600]   But I pray that we would all see our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ that way, that
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.160]   there would never be a heart, an eye of disdain towards one another.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.680]   Because that is the kind of love Christ shows us.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.120]   Element three.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:26.880]   Element three is genuine care in the labor of love.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.560]   Genuine care in the labor of love.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.440]   First we had love as expressed in desire.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.120]   Second we had love as expressed categorically in affection, treasuring.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.600]   Thirdly, we have love as expressed in the labor of love.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.480]   Many times if you read conservative Christian books, they'll say, "Hey, love's not a feeling.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.480]   It's a verb.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.480]   It's an action."
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.480]   That's true.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.400]   It's true.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.200]   Love is an action.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:57.460]   Love has to be expressed in the will, the intention of your heart as shown in the action
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.380]   of your love.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:03.560]   And genuine love will express itself when you are willing to do, right?
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.360]   Earlier, it challenged us to have a sense of harmony where you do what is right before
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.040]   all, what is honorable, what is good for their benefit, to have their interests in mind.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:16.800]   So when you do what is in the best interest of the other individual, even at the cost
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:22.720]   of yours, then all of a sudden realize, "Oh, shoot.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.520]   That is very, very loving."
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.520]   And that's the kind of love that God has shown us, isn't it?
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:33.320]   Just for the sake of time, I want all of us to remember, if we ever sometimes doubt, like
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.120]   because certain things don't go wrong or some things go wrong and they don't turn out the
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:41.120]   way we want, we might say, "But what is God doing?
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.120]   Why?"
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:48.840]   But remember that the intention and the labor of God so meticulously has been, God is working
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.200]   all things for the good of those who love Him.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:57.440]   And the book of Romans chapter 8 says, when you see that pure intent of God, you can bank
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:01.760]   on the fact that even if there's sword, fire, destruction, nothing is going to separate
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.760]   you from the love of God.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   Amen?
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.760]   Nothing.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:10.400]   Even if with your physical eyes, you see nothing but chaos, you have to believe it.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:16.080]   God absolutely has the best intentions for His glory and for you.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.080]   That's true.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.120]   It is absolutely true.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:24.020]   And when I think about Christ, to the degree in which He would go to do what is in our
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:33.440]   best interest, I think about that sometimes like, Jesus could have demanded people serve
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:37.880]   Him, but He said, "I came to serve and not to be served."
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:42.420]   Jesus could have come and said, "You all need to bow down," but rather He looked on
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:46.200]   His people with pity and He said, "You all need sacrifice.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.600]   You've got a huge debt to pay.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.600]   I'll be your ransom."
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.760]   The book of Hebrews says, "Because you're flesh and blood and you need a substitute,
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.840]   I'll become flesh and blood."
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.560]   Jesus said, "You need a sympathetic priest, I'll be your high priest.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.120]   You need a king to guide you because you're blind and you're wandering.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.680]   I have compassion for you.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.800]   I will be your king."
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:12.680]   Christ has exhibited such pure intentions for us as a people.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:17.520]   We need to model that in the church, to have pure intentions.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.860]   If sometimes we have expectations of each other, check your heart.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.560]   Why do you want people around you?
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:29.440]   Is it for their good, for their edification, sanctification, for their uplifting, for their
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:35.040]   faith, or do you just want people around you just because you want people around you?
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.280]   You see, these three things that I'm talking about right now, desire, affection, and the
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.720]   labor of love, all have to go together.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:46.320]   You have to have that kind of intentionality, that kind of affection, and that kind of desire.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:52.680]   If it's unbalanced, if it's devoid of one another, you know what it's going to become.
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.240]   Creepy.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.960]   When somebody just wants you, I want you.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.960]   You see how creepy that is?
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.960]   It's creepy.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.520]   And ladies, I gave this advice at the first service.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.040]   I'm going to give this advice too for these single ladies.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.400]   There's going to come a time when a guy's like, "Hey, girl.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.360]   Let's get to know each other," right?
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:15.200]   Don't be flattered by that initially, because there are a lot of men.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.920]   In their character, they want you because they saw something good.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:24.840]   You have to decipher, is this man of a certain character where he knows how to practice not
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.200]   I want you, but all three?
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:32.480]   I want you, I have affection for you, and I will do what is in my power for your absolute
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.400]   best.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.840]   Then you know this man is capable of love.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:41.480]   But don't be flattered because just some guy noticed you and said, "Ooh," right?
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.480]   That's nothing.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.480]   Okay, sorry.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.360]   Am I making it creepy?
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.080]   Let's move on.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.440]   Let's move on.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.680]   So all three have to go together.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.760]   All three have to go together.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:59.640]   And when they do, they're going to allow us to practice something even more beautiful,
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.760]   which is the fourth element, forgiveness.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.800]   Oh, sorry.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.040]   I missed a slide there.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:11.960]   When you do that, okay, when you practice that kind of love, it's going to not so much
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.480]   be like, "Oh, I'm just going to have to deal with you."
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.280]   But by your love, you're going to forget yourself.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.760]   And that's how the pastor's described to us.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:25.320]   By your desire, by your affection, you're going to forget, just like any good parent,
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.160]   any good brother, any good family, any good friend.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.400]   Just lose sight of yourself.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.320]   And sometimes, honestly speaking, what is the greatest hindrance?
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:40.720]   What is the greatest hindrance to larger context unity is just a simple question, "But what
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.560]   about me?"
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.720]   And then all of a sudden, unity is shone, right?
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:51.000]   Last point, I'm wrapping up here, is element of forgiveness.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.520]   Element of forgiveness.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.520]   Now forgiveness and love, it does go hand in hand.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.720]   This might feel like too specific of a concept, but you understand that forgiveness is an
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:05.420]   act of giving grace.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:10.680]   Without desire to want to be near somebody, there is going to be no motivation forgiveness.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.200]   Without that kind of affection, there's going to be no context of forgiveness.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:19.880]   Without trying to do what's best for that individual, there's going to be no incentive,
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.000]   right?
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Forgiveness is possible as a fruit of that kind of love, and that's why I say it's like
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.440]   one element as a culmination.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:34.520]   A culmination of gathering of all that love and affection in your heart is going to provide
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:40.080]   the opportunity for true reconciliation in the church.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:46.080]   I'm going to say this, that the Scriptures absolutely assume there will be conflict,
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   right?
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.840]   And you assume it, I assume it.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:52.720]   As we grow closer and closer together, as we grow broader and broader in number, as
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.000]   there are more and more differences in the church, there is going to be conflict.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.360]   And I mentioned to you again that when this conflict comes, you have certain options of
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:07.000]   becoming distant, embittered, hurt, taking revenge, or whatever it may be.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.480]   But the passage to us is clear.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:14.360]   Should one of us have a complaint against one another, let us forgive.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.360]   Let us forgive as Christ would forgive.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.080]   Now, that's something profound to think about.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:26.720]   I will say that what I've seen in both myself and other people, when you have a complaint,
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.040]   like someone is like this, or someone did that, and therefore I have a complaint in
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:35.160]   my heart, and then someone gives me advice, like you need to forgive that individual,
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.200]   there is a misconception.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:43.360]   That forgiveness means, dude, stop making such a big deal about it, right?
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:48.680]   Dude, let it go, let it go.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.680]   Forgiveness means that.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.400]   Let it go, man.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.440]   Just let it go.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:58.760]   Is that the way Jesus forgave us?
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.280]   That's something profound to think about.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:06.760]   Is that the way God simplistically forgave you and said, "Good news.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:11.080]   All that sin stuff I talked about, how you had to go through sacrifice, and now Jesus
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.480]   is here, it's not a big deal."
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.680]   Is that the way Christ forgave us?
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:17.840]   No.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:23.640]   And this is when, again, I am just reminded, simple truths of the gospel, and then reminded
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:31.480]   what God expects of true unity, reconciliation, and coming together is so far beyond my norms,
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.480]   what I'm used to.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:37.840]   Because when I think about Jesus, I start remembering all the things I mentioned before.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:43.200]   For Christ to forgive us, how He forgave us, what steps He took.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.960]   It wasn't just a, "It's okay, man.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.160]   I got no beef with you."
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.520]   That is not the way He did it.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.480]   Jesus sought something far above and beyond.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.280]   He sought to transform.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.960]   He sought to reconcile.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.720]   He sought to rectify.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.280]   He sought your repentance.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.040]   He sought to bring you light.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:05.360]   He sought to shed light and let you see His glory, let you see what's right.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.320]   You see what I'm getting at?
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:12.840]   The redemptive approach of Christ to forgive and to be united and to be truly one was so
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.880]   far above and beyond.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.880]   That's okay, man.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.300]   And so for us, that's a challenge to you.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.480]   That whatever steps it takes for us to say, "You know, I love you, and I don't want there
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.760]   to be this distance because I desire you.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:30.960]   I see you as precious in my life.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.760]   I'm willing to do what's good for you.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:40.040]   And what's more, I'm willing to go the steps that Christ gave."
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.120]   That's the challenge for unity.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:48.360]   I'm willing to go as far as my God has gone with me.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.360]   What a challenge it was.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.480]   I'm going to share something with you guys.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.520]   I've shared pretty openly.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.680]   There was recently just a sense of bitterness in my heart.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.200]   And I've been telling people, "No, it doesn't bother me that much."
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.680]   And what happened was right before I left to China, my parents got a divorce.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:07.320]   And I'm standing there thinking, "Come on, you're like 75.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.320]   Why?"
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.320]   You know?
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.280]   And that divorce was very, very bitter.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.520]   And because it was bitter, I didn't want my kids around that.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.800]   So my older brother saw that like, "Hey, did you talk to our parents yet?"
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.800]   It's like, "I'm busy."
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.520]   "Hey, did you talk to your mom yet?"
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.520]   It's like, "Well, I don't think she wants to talk to me."
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.040]   "Hey, did you talk to dad yet?"
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.120]   "No, it's been like four weeks."
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.080]   And I've been trying, I've been trying, but what I realized subconsciously, I was doing
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.520]   this.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.880]   Why?
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:39.640]   Because subconsciously I know if I get involved, that's a burden to me.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.440]   Right?
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.600]   If I get involved with them, that's a burden to me.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.720]   And then I was just rebuked.
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:48.720]   And then I was just humbled.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:53.560]   And my older brother, like, he really, really helped me to think about this as we're talking
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.560]   on the phone too.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.560]   He said, "I'm struggling with the same thing."
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.200]   But we can't.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.520]   We would dare just, we can't.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.560]   We can't distance our parents.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.120]   Right?
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.380]   How are we going to do that?
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.200]   We can't just separate them from their grandkids.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:19.040]   Likewise, for us, we are called the household of God.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:25.440]   And though it might make sense for us in practicality, distance creates safety.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:31.920]   But that distance will also create lack of unity, and in that, God will not be pleased.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.320]   Why?
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:39.440]   Because our Heavenly Father will be so pleased to see His house united.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.440]   Our Heavenly Father desires to see His children love each other.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.720]   Our Heavenly Father desires to see His kingdom have a solidarity.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.720]   Amen?
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.520]   Let's do all that to the pleasure of our God.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.520]   Let's pray.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:48:00.520]   I read you a passage in Psalm, Chapter 133.
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.640]   "Behold, how good and pleasant is it when brothers dwell in unity.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:10.560]   It is like the precious oil on the head running down on the beard and running down on the
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:13.200]   collar of His robes."
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.640]   Heavenly Father, I pray that God, You would bless us, Lord, with greater understanding
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:23.200]   of the profound nature of Your love, that we would desire to practice that faith in
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.840]   our lives and to exhibit that love in our lives and in our church.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:32.560]   But I pray, Father God, that You would also allow us to experience the great blessedness
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.440]   of being united as a family of God.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:41.480]   Lord, we thank You so much that You've brought us together, that You have orchestrated and
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.480]   pieced together this church according to Your great design.
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:51.040]   Lord, all the more than we hope to continue to strive to build it to become what You desire
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.400]   and what You envision.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:56.000]   Lord, we thank You for Your great patience with us.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.800]   We thank You for the privilege of being called Your children and being invited into Your
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.800]   household.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:06.320]   We pray all the more that as we then live our lives in that house, that it would be
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.300]   something pleasing unto You.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:09.300]   We thank You.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.300]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
