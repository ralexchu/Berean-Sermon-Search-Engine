[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   All right, we are finally at the end of the book of Hebrews.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.520]   So today is the last sermon.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.120]   We've been on it actually exactly three years.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.720]   We started three years ago, March 10th.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.240]   So we're actually almost exactly three years it took us to go through Hebrews.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.160]   And there was a stretch, I think in the middle when we were, because of the pandemic, we
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.560]   went through the IM statements of Christ.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.520]   But outside of that, I'm almost reluctant to leave.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.300]   You know, like one of the benefits of teaching through the Bible is that I benefit from it.
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.320]   You know, I remember in the beginning of ministry, you know, when I was a youth pastor and I
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.080]   was a college and EM pastor, I was just preaching just kind of topically, what does the church
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.080]   need?
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.360]   And I would choose and I would preach like that for three, four, five years.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.400]   And at the end of it, I don't, I didn't feel like I knew the Bible any more than I did
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.680]   after five, six years of it, because it's just, I just knew the topic of discipleship
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.040]   about prayer, about evangelism.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.600]   And so there's like 15, 16 different topics and you give different versions of that.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.520]   But then I remember very specifically, I decided to just preach just verse by verse, starting
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.520]   from John and then Philippians.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.320]   And then I would just make it through the New Testament.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.400]   But I remember specifically after finishing Philippians, it's like, oh, I, even though
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.840]   I went, I was an undergrad Bible major and I went to seminary, I learned more from studying
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.240]   to teach it that way than I did in all the years that I was in seminary.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.280]   And then, so, you know, the benefit ultimately, I get the first benefit because I'm able to
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.520]   dig through the scripture and examine it better than before.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.420]   So Hebrews, I've gone through several times, but I feel like I've probably gleaned more
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.760]   than you did from the study.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.200]   So I'm almost reluctant to leave it, but I do have other passages that I do want to go
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   into.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.420]   I'm still not sure exactly where, but I'll let you know as we get closer.
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.160]   After today, we're going to probably take about a month of various different topics
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.360]   that we want to cover.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.680]   And after Easter, I'll jump into the new area of what we're going to study.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.040]   But I want to read with you as we wrap up the study, just to kind of give a, again,
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040]   an overview.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.240]   And it'll be very similar to the introduction that I gave three years ago.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.080]   Hebrews 10, 32 to 34, it says, "But remember the former days when after being enlightened,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.240]   you endured a great conflict of suffering, partly by being made a public spectacle through
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.340]   reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated.
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.720]   For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully a seizure of your property,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.560]   knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one."
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.560]   Let's pray.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray that your word would convict us, lead us, transform us into the
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.720]   very thing that you desire us to be.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.000]   We thank you, Father, for your living word that judges the thoughts and intentions of
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.520]   our hearts, gives us great encouragement.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.080]   And we pray, Father God, that as we wrap up the study in the book of Hebrews, that all
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.760]   that we have learned, Lord God, would transform us, build us up, that we may be sanctified
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.840]   according to the purpose and will of your son.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.040]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.920]   Now, last week we had our salt and pepper, more salt than pepper fellowship.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.400]   And so I think we were expecting maybe about 30 people in the church.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.380]   To our surprise, we actually have close to 70, over 50 at our church.
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:40.240]   We had about 56, 57, and then we had at least a dozen who were in that category but wasn't
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.240]   able to come.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.720]   And so to our surprise, we actually have a lot more people than we thought that are over
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720]   50.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.840]   We're just scattered, so we normally don't see.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   Typically when people come to our church, it's like, "Yeah, it's all college students."
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.560]   That's what people tend to see.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.600]   But when we had that fellowship, even I was surprised that we have that many people at
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.680]   our church that are over 50.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.880]   One of the interesting thing was, because we have older people at church, that our testimonies
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.420]   and our background is very diverse.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.780]   We have people who've lived in different continents.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.260]   They were playing one of the games of what's unique that are at our table.
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.540]   And we had actually two cancer survivors at our table, so we thought that would be unique
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.540]   enough.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.260]   And then when we presented it, we found that we had three other cancer survivors.
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.020]   And so the stories that were coming out of the different tables, these are from all walks
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.980]   of life, all different backgrounds.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.020]   One of the benefits of getting older is you have the ability to be able to see.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.540]   When you're younger, there's certain things that seem so important, just seems trivial
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.340]   now as we get older.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.520]   When we're young, we're so consumed with what other people think of us.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.140]   And the older we get, we just don't care.
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.140]   It's not that we don't care at all, but it's just not as important as it was when it was
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.420]   younger.
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.420]   And then as we get older, there are certain things that become a lot more important, like
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.380]   our family, our health, things that have more value long-term.
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.260]   That's one of the benefits of getting older.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.740]   But one of the things that we have to be careful as we get older is that the things that we
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.460]   started with sometimes becomes just routine.
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.440]   And that specifically happens with our faith.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.440]   We start out with a bank.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.840]   Just like the recipients of this letter, he says, "Remember."
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.940]   Remember because they forgot.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.340]   That's why he's telling them to remember.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.020]   Remember your former days.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.980]   Remember when you first met Christ, how exciting church was, how exciting fellowship was, singing
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.420]   new songs, studying the Bible.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.100]   Every part of your faith is like, "Wow, this is a privilege."
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.700]   But for some reason, as time passes by, everything about our faith becomes a mandate, like, "I
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.340]   have to do this," and, "I don't want to do this," and fellowship becomes a burden because
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.740]   you've been burned in the past.
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.100]   And if we're not careful, we can just go through the motion.
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.300]   And you do that for a while.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.660]   After a while, just like the Bible says, you have a form of godliness, but there is no
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.420]   power.
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.260]   You've just become a very religious Christian, but there's no power.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.380]   You don't see any fruit.
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.940]   No one has ever come to Christ because of your sharing.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.820]   Everybody says, "Oh, you go to church.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.800]   You're a very religious person," but there's no power behind that because it's just a formality.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.700]   There's no real inner change, inner joy that's happening.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:41.260]   In fact, Jesus warns about this in the parable of the seeds.
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.600]   In Matthew 13, 19-22, Jesus says, "When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.980]   understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart."
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.000]   This is the one in whom seed was sown besides the road.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.980]   Those are people who are typically not in the church.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.460]   They hear the word, "I don't understand," or "I don't believe it," and they don't make
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.620]   it the way into the church.
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.060]   These are people who we're trying to invite to our services, to get to hear the gospel.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.540]   They may be our coworkers or family members, but the word of God has no effect on them.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:20.540]   The second seed, it says in verse 20, "The one whom seed was sown on the rocky places,"
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.140]   this is the man who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.280]   There seems to be immediate response, yet he has no firm root in himself, but is only
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.700]   temporary when affliction or persecution arises because of the word.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.040]   Immediately he falls away.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.740]   You probably know of some people who at one point in their life were excited for God,
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:46.140]   but as soon as they began to realize the consequence of following Christ, as long as they only
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.860]   saw the benefit, it was fine, but as soon as their faith started to get tested, they
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.620]   started drifting away and they disappeared.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.980]   So I'm sure every one of us knows somebody in our life that came and was excited for
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.900]   a period and they disappeared.
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.620]   But those people are not in the church either because eventually they leave.
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.020]   It's the third group that we constantly struggle with.
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:12.420]   It says in verse 22, "And the one on whom the seed was sown among the thorns," this is the
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:17.380]   man who hears the word and the worry of the world and the deceitfulness of the world choke
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:22.100]   the word and it becomes unfruitful.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:27.540]   Now the third soil are people who are still in the church.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.860]   Third soil are people who don't pack up their bags and leave.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.260]   It says it looks like they're bearing fruit.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:38.940]   In every way they may act like a Christian, but it says the word of God is being choked
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.620]   in their life because of the worries of this world and deceitfulness of riches.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.180]   And so on Sunday they are pursuing Christ, but Monday through Saturday they're pursuing
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.700]   the world.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:55.660]   So only time where there's any conversations about Christ, it happens at church or it happens
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.660]   at Bible study.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.740]   But it doesn't happen in any other context because the word of God is being choked in
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.020]   their life.
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.260]   And that's the concern that we have in our generation.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:12.660]   I think that the authors of Hebrew, the author of Hebrew is addressing that particular issue
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:18.620]   because these people are not specifically shaking their hands at God and say, "You
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.620]   know what?
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.620]   I'm going to be apostate.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.620]   I'm going to walk away from God.
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.620]   I don't believe this anymore."
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.780]   He's not addressing those people.
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.900]   He's not addressing people who have physically left the church.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.820]   He's not addressing people who have made it very clear where that line is.
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:38.380]   He's addressing people who are in the church and is trying to have the benefit of the both
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.380]   worlds.
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:46.460]   "How can I retain my salvation and still pursue the world?"
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:51.100]   That's what he's addressing because these people are starting to gradually drift back
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.140]   into their old life.
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:57.900]   There is no specific doctrine that they were guilty of rejecting.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.580]   They're just drifting back into their old life.
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.220]   In fact, that's the language that's repeated over and over again.
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.580]   In Hebrew chapter 2-1, "For this reason, we must pay much closer attention to what
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.140]   we have here so that we do not drift away from it."
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.060]   And I mentioned this over and over again.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.940]   Drifting is something that happens when you do nothing.
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.820]   You get on a boat, say you want to drift, what do you do?
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:20.820]   You don't need to paddle.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.260]   Just get in there and just sit.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.260]   Enjoy life.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.940]   Look at the sunset.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.100]   Play with the water.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.860]   Go fishing.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.540]   You just start drifting.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.500]   If you're not anchored, if you're not deliberately anchored because you're concerned about drifting,
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.500]   you're going to just drift.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.500]   And that's why he says to pay much close attention to the things that you have heard.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.300]   I know you guys are distracted by that bird.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:51.940]   I want to read a passage for you.
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:11:04.620]   In Psalm, I think it's chapter 50, where it says, "The birds and all the creatures are
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.620]   mine."
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.260]   So that's God's creature also.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.560]   And he found this home, so he wanted to join us for worship.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:17.540]   So let him chirp, and we'll pretend like we're out in the woods, enjoying God's creation.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.580]   Actually, he's been here all week.
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.580]   He's got to be hungry.
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.580]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:27.220]   Anyway, let's get back to the word, all right?
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.620]   I'm more distracted than you are.
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.460]   So we do not drift away, right?
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.180]   And that's the temptation that all of us are in.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.740]   You start out with a bang, and then every year that goes by, we just slowly drift, and
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:48.020]   then we wake up one day not recognizing even our own selves.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:53.220]   That person I was when I was in my 20s or 30s is, I'm just not the same person.
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.780]   And that didn't happen overnight.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:12:00.420]   It's just years and years of just neglecting and allowing this thing to keep drifting,
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.420]   and then saying, "You know what?
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.420]   That's just, it just happens.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.420]   That's what happens."
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.620]   And then so we have this attitude of, "Yeah, that happens.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.700]   And in college, yeah, that's where all the passion is, with college students or younger."
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.300]   But nobody in their 30s does that.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.140]   Nobody in their 40s or 50s does that.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.940]   And so we kind of think that passionate pursuit of Christ is something you do when you're
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:20.940]   young.
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.660]   But when you're old, you just kind of sit through, and we just make it to the end.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.620]   And that's what he's warning us about, not drifting.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.980]   Hebrews 2.3 is, "How will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?"
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.380]   I mean, think about it.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:41.100]   Think about what we sing, what we study.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:49.260]   God who created the universe, the universe, for whatever the reason, had pity on us, and
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:56.100]   sent his only begotten Son, in order that we can have eternity with him, that we can
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.460]   call him our Abba Father.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.500]   So the hope that we have in the gospel is one day when all this passes, which is 100%
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.660]   guaranteed, Christian or non-Christian, when this passes, that we will have eternity with
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.940]   him in full glory.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.780]   That's the promise of the gospel.
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:19.060]   And to profess that, sing about that, memorize that, read about it, and then to simply neglect
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.060]   it.
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.940]   Just let it be.
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.380]   You know, work.
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.100]   You're not like doing crazy things.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.180]   You're just doing what everybody else in this world does.
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.580]   Going to work, paying your bills, raising children.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:39.660]   And then in the meanwhile, just living like the rest of the world, we're just neglecting.
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.060]   We're not passionately pursuing anymore.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.280]   That's something that was in the past.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.980]   And that's what he's addressing.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.980]   Not to neglect.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.260]   Hebrews chapter 3, verse 7, it says, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.740]   heart as when they provoked me, as in the day of the trial in the wilderness."
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.740]   Today.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:14:01.700]   In other words, it's the kindness of God that leads you to salvation, leads you to repentance.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:06.380]   It's not God's knocking on the door and saying, "Oh, not today."
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.940]   And then, "Okay, then I will knock tomorrow.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.980]   If not tomorrow, then the next day I'll knock next day."
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.380]   He said, "No, today it's the kindness of God.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.780]   If the word of God comes and convicts you and you say not today, and most people who
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:26.820]   at least profess to believe God never says no to God, they just say not now."
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.780]   Now is not the time to get too serious.
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.580]   Now is not the time to really devote my time because I just got a new job.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.220]   I just got married.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.620]   I just had kids.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.700]   I'm trying to get into this career.
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.060]   I have all these things.
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.060]   Not now.
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.060]   I will.
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.060]   Okay.
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.740]   So we think that we're obeying, but it says, "If you do not obey today," he said, "you
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.780]   deliberately harden your heart."
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.740]   So the next time that maybe there's a knocking on the door, you don't even hear the knocking
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:02.700]   anymore because your hearts have become so hardened, you don't feel anything anymore.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.700]   It's just a lot of information getting into your head, but it's never enough to move you
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.980]   because our hearts have become hardened.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.060]   So when you are here, hearing the word of God week after week after week, when you're
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:20.140]   participating in Bible study and you're not responding to that every week, your heart
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.860]   is becoming harder and harder and harder.
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.100]   And that's what he's trying to address, not to neglect our salvation.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:32.340]   Hebrews chapter 13, 3-12, "Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil,
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.100]   unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God."
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:41.020]   I mean, that sounds pretty harsh for just being lukewarm, just neglecting.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.980]   An evil and unbelieving heart.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.060]   I mean, from our perspective, it just seems like, "Well, that just happens.
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.060]   We just dribbled.
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.140]   We need to work harder."
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:53.740]   But from God's perspective, he says, "It's unbelief and it's evil."
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.460]   I mean, think of it from his perspective.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.060]   He gave his only begotten son.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.220]   What's the greatest gift that you've ever given anybody?
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.100]   I mean, think about if, whatever that may be, if you gave that to somebody and they
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.380]   just kind of received it, it's like, "Oh, thanks," and they just kind of threw it on
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.500]   the couch.
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.460]   They didn't realize the gift that you've given.
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.700]   They don't realize the sacrifice that you made so that they can have that.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.660]   And it's like, "Okay, thanks," they just threw it on the couch.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:26.940]   It's an unbelieving, evil heart to profess this and then live your life like you don't
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.460]   even believe it.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:35.460]   You profess it with your mouth, but by your life, it demonstrates your unbelief.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:40.780]   So from God's perspective, I mean, it makes perfect sense that he would say this.
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:46.940]   Perseverance of the saints is one of the greatest indicators of genuine faith.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.940]   Do we persevere?
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:54.460]   You know, everybody has, again, even the three soils that are mentioned, there's some response.
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.260]   One they hear it and it's, "Okay, I don't want this."
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.460]   Or the second one, they hear it and they have immediate response, but they don't persevere.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.780]   And the third one, they seem like they're bearing fruit, but then as soon as the worries
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:11.940]   and concerns and you start coveting what other people have, all of a sudden, those concerns
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.460]   start to choke it away.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.540]   And then there's certain parts of the Bible that you don't want to hear because you've
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.300]   hearted your heart toward that.
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:26.020]   And he says, "Ultimately, God will test through various trials, through various stages in
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.460]   life, that is Jesus really better than that."
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.340]   You know, Hebrews chapter 6, 4 through 8, you know, a lot of people read this passage
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:39.300]   and misunderstand because they read it just in this context, but read what it says.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.100]   Hebrews chapter 4, it says, chapter 6, verse 4 through 8, it says, "For in the case of
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:48.140]   those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:52.180]   made partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.180]   of the age to come."
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.380]   I mean, a lot of people read this passage and say, "Well, this must be a Christian who
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.380]   loses his salvation."
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.540]   Because it sounds like a Christian.
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.140]   Let me make this very clear.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:07.420]   A genuine Christian can never lose his salvation.
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:12.820]   The reason why, first of all, because you didn't earn it, so you can't lose it.
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.340]   God gave it to us sovereignly.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.260]   Then what does he mean here if that's the case?
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.260]   Look at verse 6.
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.700]   "And then have fallen away.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.260]   It is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucified to themselves the
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.620]   Son of God and put him to open shame."
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:29.860]   What does it mean?
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:35.620]   Does this mean if he's referring to a Christian who loses his salvation, does this mean that
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:40.420]   God gives you one chance and you had that chance?
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.460]   And because you've fallen away, that God will not accept your repentance?
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.620]   Is that what this passage means?
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:50.500]   If this means a Christian loses his salvation, once you backslide, you're done.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.660]   Actually that's not what this means.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.060]   The clear explanation is in verse 7.
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:01.380]   "For the ground that drinks the rain, which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation,
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:06.900]   useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:11.220]   But if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.540]   ends up being burned."
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:18.700]   So what he's referring to are people who are in the church, have benefited from the
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.660]   Word, where the Holy Spirit is working within the church.
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.060]   He has the Word, so in every way he's been exposed to everything that a genuine believer
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:32.660]   needs to be saved, and yet he bears no fruit.
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.220]   He's an individual who willfully rejects the things of God.
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.220]   Willfully.
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.940]   So he's not talking about somebody who wants to follow Christ and he didn't do well and
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.020]   he backslid for a period that he can't repent.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.700]   Clearly that contradicts everything that we know in the Bible.
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.300]   What he's referring to are individuals who are in the church.
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:58.100]   The third soil people who've been in the church, who are going through the motion,
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:03.020]   have the form of godliness, but there's no power.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.380]   Who've received every blessing that you could.
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:12.980]   You're around Christians, you're around the Word of God, you're around missions, fellowship,
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.980]   and then you choose to pursue after the world.
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.940]   There's no other repentance because the only way of repentance is Christ, and so by your
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.780]   action you reject Christ.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.380]   You receive Christ with your mouth, but by your life you pursue the world.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.920]   That's what he means by that.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:32.200]   And that's why he spends the whole book of Hebrews reminding them that Jesus is better
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.460]   than everything that you're tempted by.
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.820]   And so that's the question that we need to be asking ourselves.
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.020]   Is Jesus really better?
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.560]   Because you can love the church without loving Jesus.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.620]   You can love other Christians without loving Jesus.
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.220]   You can love the leadership without loving Jesus.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:53.780]   You can do missions without loving Jesus.
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.300]   You can become a pastor without loving Jesus.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.920]   As crazy as that sounds.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.500]   You can be a missionary without loving Jesus.
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:11.220]   He says the remedy for a Christian adulterous life is to have the best marriage that he
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.220]   can have.
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:19.940]   You know, what prevents me, and I think every single one of us, is capable of adultery because
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.180]   we're all tempted.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:29.020]   But what prevents us, what's the greatest guarantee that prevents someone from adultery
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.220]   is to have the best marriage that he can have.
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.420]   To love your wife.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.180]   To love your husband.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.940]   So that everything else, everybody else looks like rubbish.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.100]   At least on the surface.
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.500]   And I don't think there's any secret.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.900]   I think the best decision I've ever made in my life, outside of following Christ, is marrying
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:50.900]   Esther.
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.980]   I mean, it wasn't like perfect from the beginning.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:22:01.980]   I mean, God allowed us to go through stuff and we were able to be where we're at now.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.580]   I don't get tempted with that.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:08.700]   Again, I'm supposed to knock on wood on this, right?
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.900]   Because I can't imagine anybody better than her.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.460]   I can't imagine that.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.980]   So why would I forsake that?
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:22.740]   Would I have the gift that God has given me through my wife to play around because of
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.060]   the temporary temptation?
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.620]   And that's why he's going back.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:32.260]   He said, "Maybe you've forgotten what you have in Christ.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.340]   Maybe you've forgotten your first love.
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.180]   You've forgotten what it was like when you first met Christ.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.720]   You forgot who he is."
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.740]   And that's why he spends the whole letter going over Jesus.
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.060]   It's not simply to, "I want to make sure that you understand all Christology.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:54.140]   That if somebody asks you about the new covenant and somebody asks you about the Melchizedek
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.620]   that you can say, 'I can answer these questions.'"
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:03.940]   No, every part of what he's been saying is to remind them of the preciousness of Christ.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:08.500]   So that whatever it is tempting them out of that is that, "Do you really think that the
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.300]   angels are better than Jesus?
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.900]   Jesus is the creator.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.400]   Angels are just created.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.860]   Do you really think that Moses is better?
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.360]   Moses was a servant.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.100]   Jesus is the son of God.
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:26.500]   Do you really, you're tempted because you think that somehow that if you purchased land
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.740]   and had a nice house and you have enough money in the bank account that that's where you're
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.060]   going to find rest?
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.140]   Jesus is the true rest.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.100]   The labor to find rest in Christ.
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.740]   You're drifting back to your old system under Aaron.
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.100]   Christ is the fulfillment of all.
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:50.340]   The only reason why God even put up with Aaron is because Aaron served the purpose of pointing
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.340]   to Christ.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:58.060]   I mean, if it was up to, if it was, Aaron should not have lived.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:03.100]   If you know anything about Aaron, Aaron should have been wiped out a long time ago.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:07.300]   Only reason God even put up with Aaron is because he was being used to prepare for the
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.420]   coming of Christ.
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.620]   And you're tempted to go back to that system?
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:20.100]   See, only reason why genuine believers get tempted into this world is because we've taken
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.700]   our eyes off of Christ.
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.540]   We've forgotten our first love.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.860]   Do you remember when you first met Christ?
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:34.020]   I know some of you, your salvation wasn't like, wow, my eyes are open and I love Jesus.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.280]   Some of you, it's gradual.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:41.660]   Whether you got bonked over the head or whether it had gradual understanding, you know early
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.620]   on what your Christian life was like.
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.940]   God grabbed you by the throat and forced you to come to church.
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.660]   You know, when young Christians come to church, I always love the questions that they ask.
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.660]   Can I, am I allowed to sit up in the front?
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.700]   Can I come to Bible study?
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:04.180]   Because they're just so excited about their faith because they met Christ and it changed
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.180]   everything.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.100]   And then you talk to Christians who've been walking for 30, 40, 50 years like, is that
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.100]   mandatory?
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.060]   Do I have to do that?
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.340]   What happens if I don't?
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:23.140]   The difference between the first and the latter is their affection for Christ.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:27.180]   It's because their first love is still there.
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.980]   And so everything becomes a privilege.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.020]   Your worship is just something that happens.
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:36.820]   It's not something that you do because you came on Sunday.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.700]   Everything hinges upon Christ.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:45.420]   When we recognize the beauty of Christ, the love of Christ, the gentle beckoning of Christ,
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:52.340]   the enduring patience of Christ, the sustaining power of Christ, the immutable nature of Christ,
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:57.340]   how can you not but to fall in love?
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:03.540]   Because just like Paul says, in view of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ,
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.780]   everything became rubbish.
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:13.060]   Our struggle is we're trying to make the world be rubbish without Christ.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.340]   It's just not going to happen.
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:23.060]   Because Satan is beautiful.
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.500]   Satan is not described as ugly in the Bible.
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.380]   He's an angel, just a fallen angel.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:35.380]   The only difference between a devil and an angel is his moral nature.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:40.740]   The external beauty, usually when we picture an angel from God, is beautiful with white
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:46.980]   wings, attractive, you know, glow, and then a demon is hunched over with fangs.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.460]   That's not how the Bible describes him.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.580]   The angel in his outer beauty is beautiful.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:58.500]   So the angel in his temptation is also beautiful.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:06.020]   Only in comparison to Christ, it becomes rubbish.
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:12.420]   So the moment we take our eyes off of Christ and our affection is not in Christ, then of
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.780]   course you're going to give into temptation.
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.780]   Who doesn't want to live comfortably?
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.380]   When you get on an airplane and they offer you the first class seat, do you say, "No,
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.260]   no, no, give it to the next person."
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.260]   Is that you?
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.260]   Weirdo.
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.420]   Of course we want to be comfortable.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.500]   You want to eat nice stuff.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.420]   You want to have nice things.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.700]   By our nature we want that.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.620]   And there's not necessarily like, "Oh, if you want to be a good Christian, you always
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.420]   have to take the bad seat and live hard."
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.980]   I'm not saying that either.
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:53.340]   But when that becomes our primary pursuit and you're willing to sacrifice an active,
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:58.980]   passionate pursuit of Christ in order to have that, then that has become your idol.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.820]   You're taking your eyes off of Christ because you think somehow there's rest there.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.480]   You think somehow there's more life there.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.100]   When every time you come to church you profess it is not.
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:18.660]   Whatever you are willing to compromise to have, that's your idol.
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.380]   That's your idol.
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.940]   That's your pursuit.
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:22.940]   That's your passion.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.580]   It doesn't matter what you say.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.700]   It doesn't matter what you profess.
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:31.700]   Because our actions always say more than what we say.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:36.220]   That's why he says, "Knowing the surpassing knowledge of knowing Christ, that He's more
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:42.140]   beautiful than anything that we can be tempted by this world," he says, "let us," chapter
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:48.300]   four, verse one, "therefore let us fear while a promise remains of entering His rest."
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.820]   You know, fear typically we think it's negative.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.380]   But fear is not always negative, right?
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.420]   Fear prevents us from walking into danger.
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:02.360]   If you see a dark alley and you know there's drug activity going on with gang violence,
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.360]   you don't walk in there.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.360]   It's like, "I have no fear."
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.360]   No, that's dumb.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:15.260]   You don't buy a house near biohazardous thing in the ground because you're afraid that that's
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.260]   going to somehow harm you.
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:21.140]   So fear is good because it causes you to take things seriously.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.980]   There's weightiness.
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:28.620]   So when it comes to the things of God, and we are nonchalant about it, we're very fearful
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.820]   that we're not going to be able to pay our bills.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:35.060]   We're very fearful, but if I do things, my friends are going to reject us.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.980]   We're very fearful, but if we don't save up enough, that we're not going to have enough
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.180]   money for retirement.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:45.820]   So because of this fear, it causes us to change our behavior, our values.
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:52.300]   But of all the things, all the good fears, the greatest and the most beneficial fear
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:58.740]   is to fear the Lord and see the weightiness of what it is that we are dealing with.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.620]   You're not just hearing empty words.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:04.500]   I'm not just giving you philosophy where you can take it or leave it.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:10.260]   This is the Word of God that is warning us, encouraging us, and challenging us.
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.540]   So he says, "Let us fear while a promise remains."
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:18.900]   Verse 11, "Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest."
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.900]   Let us be diligent.
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.900]   Be active.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:21.900]   Right?
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.260]   Apply the things that we learn.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:29.980]   You know, in the sports arena, there's usually, let's say you're playing basketball, there's
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.620]   usually about 20 experts in that stadium.
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.020]   20.
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.980]   They're experts because they're playing.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.980]   They're sweating.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.980]   They're getting cut.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:40.980]   They're getting injured.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.300]   They're fighting with every ounce of energy they have.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.500]   Even as they're injured, they go back.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:50.780]   Or the coaches were maneuvering every knowledge that they've had in basketball in order to
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.340]   win this competition.
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:59.820]   And then we have about 40,000 experts from analysis.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.380]   They're experts because they've watched a lot of basketball.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:08.180]   They watched so much basketball that every decision that the coaches made is like, "Ah,
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.180]   it's so dumb.
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.180]   Shouldn't do that."
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.500]   LeBron shouldn't dunk with his right hand.
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.060]   He should be dunking with his left hand.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.580]   You shouldn't be taking shots from out there.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:23.980]   And so we have 40,000 people who are experts from analysis.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:32.320]   We shouldn't be experts of the gospel because we read, because we exposited a text.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:37.740]   We should become experts of the gospel because we labored and strived to share the gospel,
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:43.740]   because we were on our knees begging for their souls with the cuts and bruises that come
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:48.700]   along in the context of doing ministry.
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.860]   If we're not careful, we can be a church filled with people who become experts in all these
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:58.140]   fields from analysis because we read someone else's testimony.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:04.660]   We read what someone else did, but it's not from personal experience.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:10.100]   We're all armchair experts if we're not careful.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:17.580]   If Christ truly is what we profess that he is, he says, "Let us be diligent to enter
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.580]   that rest."
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.900]   Verse 14, chapter 4, "Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.820]   the heavens, Jesus, Son of God, let us hold fast our confession."
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.220]   Hold fast.
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:31.540]   To proactively hold on.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:36.000]   Apostle Paul, I think, explains it the best in Philippians 3, 12 through 15.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.020]   This is an apostle who probably preached the gospel to more people and has suffered more
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:44.540]   than any other person at this time.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:50.100]   Sitting in prison, possibly awaiting his death, and this is what he says, "Not that I have
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:54.540]   already obtained it or have already become perfect, but I press on so that I may lay
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.820]   hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus."
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.020]   I press on.
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.060]   Sitting in prison?
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:06.020]   You think there's an opportunity, it's like I'm relaxing, I'm taking it easy because I'm
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.020]   in prison.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.500]   But he says, "I press on."
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.420]   Verse 13, "Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet, but one thing
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:18.140]   I do, forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.860]   the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus."
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:25.500]   He's sitting in prison and he's writing this letter because he's concerned about the Christians
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.780]   who are outside the church.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:31.440]   If you've never studied the book of Philippians, you would never know that this is a man sitting
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.980]   in prison.
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:39.500]   Because when you think of Philippians, you think of rejoice always.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:44.300]   It's an epistle where he's rejoicing, he's thankful, he's praying constantly.
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.140]   But he's sitting in prison, possibly awaiting his death, writing this letter.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.020]   And he says, "I have not laid hold of it yet.
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.020]   I press on.
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.020]   I strain."
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:34:00.820]   Which is, again, one of the temptations when we get older is we think that passion and
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.140]   diligent pursuit is for the youth.
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.540]   Yeah, yeah, 20s.
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.820]   And we always get excited when young people come to faith.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.500]   It's like, "Yeah, yeah, they're so excited."
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.500]   That's what happens in your 20s.
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.500]   Yeah, of course.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:21.980]   When was the last time you met somebody in their 60s, passionate for their faith?
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:26.700]   Because we have a tendency to kind of take the back seat as we get older, as if we've
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:27.700]   already retired.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:31.620]   We haven't retired at work yet, but we've retired spiritually.
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.540]   We just kind of let the young guys do the work.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:40.100]   You know what's interesting is I hear that kind of sentiment earlier and earlier.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.700]   I hear that from sometimes...
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:43.700]   I don't know why, it's getting early.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.180]   I hear 25-year-olds saying, "Oh, man, my back."
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:54.700]   And I look at the 19-year-olds, "When I was your age."
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:58.780]   And then you know there's going to be a 30-year-old, it's like, "Oh, you young punk.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.980]   25, wait till you get 30.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.220]   When you're 30, it's over."
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:09.900]   And then you know there's going to be a guy in his late 30s, it's like, "What, at 30,
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.060]   you infant?
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.060]   You think you're old?"
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:19.340]   And then the 40-years-old are going to step in, it's like, "30?
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:25.220]   You wait till you get 40, you can't see anymore."
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.700]   And for whatever the reason, we hit that retirement early.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:34.140]   And we think this passionate pursuit of Christ is something that you do when you're young,
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:42.460]   and then you just kind of retire at 25, 30, 40, 50, 60.
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:47.820]   You know, I have all my roommates back in college, they're all 10, 11 years older than
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.660]   me, so they're in their mid-60s now.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:55.820]   And so last time I went to have lunch with them, you know, they're missionaries in different
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:00.500]   countries and pastors, and you know, and I sit down and I'm very curious because they're
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.700]   hitting their mid-60s, like, "What's your plan?
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.700]   What are you going to do?
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.380]   Are you going to retire?"
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.300]   Thinking that I'm going to get some pointers, like, "What's coming?
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.420]   What's the next stage of my life?"
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:16.220]   And every single one of them, it's like, they have plans for their 70s.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.460]   So I just shut my mouth.
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.900]   I couldn't even ask, right?
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:22.900]   They have plans.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:23.900]   "What, 70s?
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.120]   You have plans for your 70s?"
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.060]   If it was labor, if it was just work, yeah.
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:32.860]   I mean, you've done it, if you have enough retirement saved, then that's it.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:36.540]   But when is retirement spiritually?
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.420]   When is the retirement age spiritually?
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:43.360]   There shouldn't be any.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:50.600]   Because the seriousness of what He has called us to does not end at 30 or 50 or 80 until
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.780]   He comes or we go to Him.
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.140]   He says, "Let us diligently hold fast."
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:02.340]   And then verse 16, "Let us draw near with the confidence to the throne of grace, so
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:08.300]   that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:12.020]   Let us draw near to the throne of grace.
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:17.700]   You know, I'm very encouraged that so many of our families are trying to adopt, who've
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:21.660]   already adopted and adopting, in the process of adopting.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:26.860]   And even the embryo adoption is happening now, so we're encouraged to see that.
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:32.820]   But what if you adopted a child and that child is living in your home, benefiting from everything
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:38.900]   that you've done, but they always keep you at an arm's length?
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.980]   They will only hold your hand if you grab their hand, but they never come and sit on
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.660]   your lap.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.660]   They always kind of see you at a distance.
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:50.300]   Now, you're all, your biological children are jumping on you, but that child is always
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:56.220]   sitting in the back just watching them, you know, because I'm adopted.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.940]   How would you feel as a parent?
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:04.980]   You know, when we're told in the Bible, "Let us draw near to the throne of grace," this
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.980]   is not just a legal presentation.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.860]   Now the barrier is gone.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.100]   Now you're able to come.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.220]   There's reason why he adopted us as his children.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:18.380]   He didn't just say, "I forgive you and you're no longer going to be judged," and then he
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.540]   remains the king, which he is.
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:31.940]   There's a reason why he says, "Abba, Father, Daddy," because he has adopted us.
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:37.100]   Just like if you were to adopt a child, you want that child to embrace you and love you
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:41.100]   and to see you as their dad or their mom.
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:46.740]   So this invitation to draw near to him is our Abba, Father, telling his children to
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.100]   come.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:54.420]   That's why I sent my only son, so you can also be co-heirs with Christ.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.660]   You're not a second citizen in the kingdom of God.
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.780]   You're my child.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:04.500]   So when he invites us to come into the throne of grace, it is not a legal invitation that
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.900]   you have now the ticket to enter.
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:13.900]   It's a loving father who wants to commune with his son, with his daughter.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.620]   Come to the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.980]   If you need help, come.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:23.300]   Come I'll give you help because you're my child.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:30.460]   Let us draw near to the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.860]   Chapter 6, verse 1, "Therefore, leaving the elementary teaching about Christ, let us press
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.940]   on to maturity."
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.620]   We have not come to full maturity yet.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:43.580]   Philippians 1, 6, "He who began a good work anew will carry it on to completion, unto
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.620]   the day of Christ.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:52.180]   Our pursuit of him to maturity does not end at 30, 50, 80, until the day of Christ."
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:56.820]   Chapter 10, 24, "And let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:57.820]   deeds."
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:03.980]   To as I am pursuing Christ, help other people as well.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.180]   Tell other people, encourage them, stimulate.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.900]   12, 1, "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:14.780]   also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles."
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.380]   What's hindering us?
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:25.800]   What has captivated your heart that is preventing you from running this race passionately?
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:31.740]   What anxiousness, what fear, what concern is causing you to run this race with hindrance?
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:37.740]   12, 1, "Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, this marathon."
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:43.340]   You know, whenever you see a marathon, the largest number of people is in the beginning,
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.660]   right?
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.820]   And sometimes they come in groups, right?
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.820]   Maybe some of you have done that.
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.900]   You get together with a bunch of your friends, and say, "Yeah, we're going to run this
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:51.900]   race."
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.100]   By the time they're halfway through, they're not together, right?
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.980]   By the halfway through, some of them are going to quit, have already quit.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.380]   And then you could see who's going to quit by the time they're halfway through.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:09.540]   And by the time they're at the end of the race, nobody comes in holding hands.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.980]   They come in one by one.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.540]   Some of them already dropped out.
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.580]   Some of them are fatigued.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.940]   Some of them are way behind.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.580]   But the crowd is always largest in the beginning.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:26.220]   And the finish line always comes one by one.
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.420]   We should not be satisfied that we started the race.
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:37.540]   Paul says, "Run to win, to finish this race, to make sure that we commit and we get to
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:43.420]   the end, and not just be satisfied that we have the number we've registered, but to run
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:44.420]   to win."
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.980]   We're not there yet.
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:50.460]   We're still living in darkness.
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:57.620]   Don't wait until deathbed to be concerned about your loved ones.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:05.660]   Don't wait until you get an emergency call and then say, "Shoot, I only have a few days."
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.460]   Run to win.
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.940]   Run with sense of urgency.
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:16.900]   Run with fear, knowing that there are serious consequences.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:23.260]   Run as if we really believe what we're seeing and we're professing.
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.260]   Run to win.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:29.700]   12, 28, "Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude."
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.860]   Let us be thankful for all that God has given us.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:36.500]   And then chapter 13, verse 3, "So let us go out to him outside the camp, bearing his
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.500]   reproach."
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.020]   Outside the camp.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:44.940]   One of the frustrations for many Christians is they want to try to meet Christ inside
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.340]   the camp.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:52.780]   They want to be inside the camp, accepted by the world, have what the world offers,
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.680]   and have Jesus too.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.740]   And that's where the frustration lies.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:03.460]   We want to enjoy all that the world has to offer inside the camp, wondering why it's
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:08.380]   so difficult to connect with Christ when Christ keeps telling us, "Come outside the camp."
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.380]   Christ is not in the camp.
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.580]   He's outside the camp.
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.780]   We need to drop out of our rat race.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.380]   It doesn't mean that you can't have a job.
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.220]   It doesn't mean that you shouldn't take care of your children.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:22.860]   All these things are what good Christians do.
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:28.340]   But if that's our primary pursuit and you're trying to fight and connect with Christ inside
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:35.780]   the camp, he made it very clear, you cannot serve mammon and God at the same time.
[00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:42.100]   So the invitation is, if Christ truly is better than anything that tempts us, he says, "Come
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:45.020]   outside the camp."
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.580]   Join him where he went.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:51.420]   The greatest commandment in the scripture is to love the Lord your God with all your
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.500]   heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:44:03.500]   And I remember early on as a Christian, this was such a stumbling block to me because I
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.980]   liked Jesus.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.660]   I mean, there's nobody or nothing like Jesus.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.940]   I obey Jesus.
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.460]   I worship Jesus.
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:17.180]   But I'm not sure if I could say I love Jesus.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:21.460]   Because I would compare, because what I know of love is at that time I loved my mom and
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.460]   dad.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.420]   I loved my family.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.580]   And I had some friends that I love.
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.540]   Do I love Jesus that way?
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:34.140]   You know, the way I think about this is, you know, those of you who love your mom or love
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:38.180]   your wife, and I hope you love your wife and your husband, right?
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.300]   Soon as somebody says something or sounds like they're going to say something about
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.740]   them, you get offended.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.700]   They don't even have to say it.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:48.980]   You think they're going to say it, then you get offended.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:51.420]   Your son is, and you cringe.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:56.220]   Like, what are you going to say about my son?
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.620]   Or your mom, right?
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.540]   I saw your mom at the supermarket.
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:05.780]   She didn't dress nicely.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:09.600]   You cringe because you love them.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.660]   You don't want to hear it.
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:17.680]   How do you react when people blaspheme our God?
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:26.320]   When they drag his name through the mud, saying that maybe he had a child out of wedlock and
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.920]   married Mary?
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.760]   That he was a liar?
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:35.800]   That he just fooled a lot of people?
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:46.600]   Do you just hear that as just information?
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:51.120]   I think if we love Jesus, it would bother us more.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.760]   If we really love Jesus.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:59.280]   Because our natural tendency is whatever we love, we want to share.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.800]   You find that, I know the best boba shops.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.960]   I'm not even a boba drinker.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.680]   I know the best boba shops in Irvine.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.680]   You know why?
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.560]   Because you tell me.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.320]   You put it on your Facebook.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.960]   I don't care.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.520]   I'm not a boba eater, but I know.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:18.840]   I know which movies are the best movies.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.040]   Because you share it.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:25.300]   I know if I take a vacation, where I should go.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.340]   Because you share it.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:31.200]   Because whatever you love, you end up sharing.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:35.560]   Because you want other people to love what you love.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:41.240]   If you're a Dodgers fan, you are a Dodgers apologist.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.080]   You want everybody to be a Dodgers fan.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:47.320]   Why aren't you a Dodgers fan?
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.800]   Because we have a tendency to share.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.000]   And because we want other people to love what we love.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.440]   You see, loving Christ is the backbone of everything that we do.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:04.500]   If you don't love Christ, you can't worship.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:11.360]   If you don't love Christ, you're just regurgitating information when you're sharing the gospel.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:16.520]   If you don't love Christ, you're just singing songs.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:21.840]   If you don't love Christ, you're just studying words.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.400]   If you don't love Christ, you're just building friendships.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.160]   You're not partnering.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.800]   You're not fellowshipping.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.120]   That's why he says the greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.680]   heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:39.680]   Because until you have love for Christ, until Christ becomes more precious than anything
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:45.680]   else, we may love the church without Christ.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.440]   We may love missions without Christ.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.960]   We may love teaching without Christ.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   We may love theology without Christ.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:55.920]   But at the end, it means nothing if we don't love Christ.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:02.160]   So in conclusion, as we wrap up this letter, it doesn't matter whether our church is 1,000
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.240]   or 10,000.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:12.520]   A church of 10 that loves Christ with all their hearts has more power than 10,000 people
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.000]   just nonchalantly coming in and out of church.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.680]   I pray that that would be you and I.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:28.080]   Let's pray.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.440]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your constant grace and provision you give
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.300]   us.
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:38.120]   We are truly unworthy of all that you've given.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:42.000]   Lord, you know how easily we stray.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.800]   We get so tempted with trivial things that we know it's trivial, and yet when we're tempted,
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.160]   we give in.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:55.400]   I pray, Father God, that you would help us remember the height from which we had fallen
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:01.760]   to repent and redo the things that we did at first so that above everything that we
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:07.480]   are pursuing, that the love of Christ would take center stage.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.480]   We praise you.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.840]   We thank you.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:15.120]   Give us strength, Lord God, to persevere, to be anchored in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.680]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.120]   Amen.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:26.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
