[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Psalm chapter 90, and I want to read,
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.920]   we're going to be in this text for about three weeks.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.460]   So before we jump into the book of Hebrews, we want to take some time to kind of wrestle
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.640]   through this text, and then you'll understand why I chose this text in a minute once we
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.640]   begin the sermon.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.440]   But we'll be here, and then when I come back from India, we'll jump back, jump into the
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.480]   study of the book of Hebrews for those of you who want to get a head start.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.400]   Alright, so let's start reading.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.880]   I'm reading out of the NASB, verse 1.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.520]   "Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.280]   Before the mountains were born, or you gave birth to the earth and the world, even from
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.400]   everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.000]   You turn man back into dust and say, 'Return, O children of men.'
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.760]   For a thousand years in your sight are like yesterday when it passes by.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.480]   For as a watch in the night, you have swept them away like a flood.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.020]   They fall asleep in the morning.
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.640]   They are like grass which sprouts anew.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.560]   In the morning it flourishes and sprouts anew.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.040]   Toward evening it fades and withers away.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.760]   For we have been consumed by your anger.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.160]   By your wrath, we have been dismayed.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.680]   You have placed our iniquity before you, our secret sins in light of your presence.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.880]   For all our days have declined in your fury.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.120]   We have finished our years like a sigh.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.360]   As for the days of our life, they contain seventy years, or if due strength, eighty
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.360]   years.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.640]   Yet their pride is but labor and sorrow.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.800]   For soon it is gone and we fly away.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.040]   Who understands the power of your anger and your fury according to the fear that is due
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.040]   you?
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.280]   So teach us to number our days that we may present to you a heart of wisdom.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.040]   Do return, O Lord, how long will it be, and be sorry for your servants.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.880]   O satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness that we may sing for joy and be glad
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.480]   all our days.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.140]   Make us glad according to the days you have conflicted us and the years we have seen evil.
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.600]   Let your work appear to your servants and your majesty, their children.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.360]   Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us and confirm for us the work of our hands.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.400]   Yes, confirm the work of our hands.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.480]   Let's pray.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.560]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much for your faithfulness in 2018.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.120]   We thank you, Father, as we look forward to the next year.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.880]   As we reflect, evaluate, project, and plan, give us a heart of wisdom according to your
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.800]   word.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.400]   May pursuing Christ, worshiping Christ, fellowshipping with Christ be our greatest passion.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.340]   So for that end, we pray for your reminder, we pray for encouragement and guidance.
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.920]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.040]   All right, as you guys know, today is the last service of 2018.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.680]   It went by so quick, right?
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.040]   Again, you say it every single year, I say it every single year, but it seems like every
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.640]   year it goes by faster and faster.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.280]   Some of you, 2018 was filled with joy.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.000]   You had, I can't remember how many weddings we've had.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.760]   I can't remember how many children we had.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.920]   It almost seemed like it was every single week.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.600]   So it's great that a lot of you are multiplying.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.360]   You've taken trips.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.360]   Maybe you've gotten raises.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.520]   In 2018, maybe it was a good year for you.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.280]   And maybe in 2019, you're praying that God would continue to bless you in your life.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.160]   There's some of you in this room that has gone through tremendous hardship.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.880]   You've wrestled through the sickness of a loved one.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.720]   And even now, I know that there's many in our church who have parents or sister or brother
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.640]   or somebody that they're praying over and is visiting the hospital on a regular basis.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.400]   And so we are praying with you and we see you from a distance.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.160]   And so 2018 has been a rough year and 2019 looks like it's going to be a rough year for
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.280]   you as well.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.080]   Every year at the end of the year, we naturally, whether we like it or not, it's all over.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.280]   Whether it's at church or you're watching television, they have a countdown.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   What happened in 2018?
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.720]   What are the 10 best things that happened?
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.440]   If you're a sports fan, what are the 10 best dunks in the NBA?
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.560]   And so everything is kind of winding down.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.160]   And then when the new year comes, they begin to project that hopefully, you know, this
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.880]   is what's going to happen.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.540]   So it forces us to reflect upon what happened.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.280]   For me, as I look upon 2018, you know, the biggest thing obviously that happened to me
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.840]   was I turned 50.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:43.760]   And again, it's just another year, but it's difficult not to think of mortality, you know.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.240]   Not that, again, I know there's people in this room who are much older than I am and
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.480]   so I don't want to offend anybody, but at the same time, turning 50 kind of caused me
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.200]   to think about, you know, like the next generation.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.760]   You know, I don't know how long God's going to have me on this earth, whether it's 25
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.720]   years, 30 years, 10 years or five years, I don't know.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.640]   But turning 50 definitely made that reality much more real.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.760]   That our time here is limited.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.120]   And it is passing by so fast, you know.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.400]   And I remember very specifically, you know, my 25th birthday.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.760]   And the reason why I remember the 25th birthday so vividly was because that was the first
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.080]   birthday I had after I got married.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.320]   And so Esther threw a birthday party, invited all the youth group kids, you know, to our
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.600]   apartment and I remember her making the Korean dish doenjang jjigae.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.640]   I remember very specifically everything about that party, who was there, you know, and because
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.160]   it was the first time I felt like I had a full-blown birthday party for me and I was
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.400]   married and my wife threw that for me.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.520]   So it was so vivid.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.640]   And then I think about it seemed like yesterday that would happen and those 25 years went
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.380]   by just like that, right?
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.360]   And so, you know, as I get older, I realize that money comes and goes.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.400]   There are periods of life you have more money than you need or you don't have enough.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.720]   But you can always get money.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.720]   You can lose money.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   But time, once it is spent, is gone.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.760]   And so the most valuable thing that we have really is time, you know.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.560]   And that's the danger when we're young because we don't think of time as a commodity.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.400]   We think of time as something that we just spend to enjoy ourselves until you get to
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.960]   a certain age and then you begin to become more wiser and think, oh, maybe I should be
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.760]   more wise with my time.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.960]   But a real wise person recognizes that early on in your 20s, right?
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.600]   And not what you wait until your 40s or 50s or 60s, but in your 20s, you recognize that
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.440]   this is one life that God has given you.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.040]   How am I going to invest it for God's kingdom?
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:55.160]   All of this, it really is introduction really to chapter 90 of Psalms because the background
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:02.920]   behind the Psalms is Moses has led the nation of Israel through the desert for 40 years.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.240]   So they're on this side of the mountain looking and eagerly anticipating going into the promised
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.900]   land.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:16.040]   So what Moses does here is he's reminiscing over the past of Israel's sin that caused
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.800]   them to be wandering for 40 years.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.040]   And they're eagerly anticipating that once we get to the other side, everything that
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.000]   they had hoped for was going to be fulfilled.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.200]   And so Moses has taken his time, kind of just like, you know, at the end of every year,
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.160]   we're reflecting back in the past and projecting for the future.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.060]   That's exactly what Moses is doing here in chapter 90.
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.000]   So it's split in three parts.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.420]   So I'm going to be covering the first, next week, the second, and then the week after
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.420]   that third.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.600]   It's split into three sections.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.160]   First section in verses one through six, which we're going to be covering today, is to remind
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.280]   the nation of Israel who God is.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.560]   And so we're going to be spending some time talking about that, that before they move
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:06.400]   forward that our view of God is the most fundamental and important truth that if we get it wrong,
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   or if we have a misunderstanding of God, or a partial understanding of God, it affects
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.600]   the way we see church, it affects the way we see money, it affects the way we see relationships,
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.160]   eternity, it affects everything about our life.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.520]   So first and foremost, Moses reminds them of who God is.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.800]   Second section, verses seven through 12, in light of who God is, he talks about who is
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.660]   man.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.920]   What does a nation of Israel need to remember?
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.800]   So he talks about their 40 years and why they were wandering and why God was angry with
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   them.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.960]   He reminds them of that before they get into the promised land so that they don't repeat
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.160]   the same mistake.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:51.760]   And then the third and final part of it, verse 13 to 17, describes man's dire need for God.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.440]   That knowing who God is, knowing your condition, that the only answer to that is to cry out
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.760]   to God and for God to answer and to forgive.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.080]   And that's the last and final section.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.160]   That before they move into the promised land, they needed to have this, and they need to
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.880]   have a firm grasp of who God is, who they are, and who it is that they are depending
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.880]   on.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.480]   And that's how this chapter is divided.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.400]   So the way that I named it was, "Look up, look in, and look out."
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.840]   So that's going to be the sermon outline, or at least the title of the three-part sermon.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.720]   So today is the look up part, look to God.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.760]   First thing that he says in the beginning, it says, "It is good to give thanks to the
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.760]   Lord."
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.760]   No, I'm in a different chapter.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.680]   Okay, it's verse 90.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.280]   That didn't sound right.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:45.320]   "You have been our dwelling in all generations."
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.800]   Now you might read that in passing if you know the background.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   Remember what we talked about?
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.880]   In order to understand the Bible, what's the first and most important thing that we need
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   to understand?
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.880]   Context, right?
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:02.840]   So if you don't know the context, it just sounds like many other passages where it says,
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.120]   "Lord, you are my dwelling."
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.760]   But remember the context in which this is written.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.440]   They're eagerly anticipating to get into what?
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.320]   The promised land, their new home.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.840]   The word for dwelling place here in some other places is translated refuge, or if you want
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.560]   to take it literally, it just means home.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.640]   Before you get into your home that you've been wandering for 40 years and fantasizing
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:38.640]   about, crossing over this mountain and finally getting to the promised land, he reminds them
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.160]   that the Lord your God is your refuge.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.680]   He's your refuge.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:52.840]   For every single one of us, for every single one of us, there is a longing and a desire
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.040]   to be home.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:01.160]   No matter how much you love to travel, no matter how many places you go, whether you're
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.760]   an introvert or an extrovert, at some point, you want to eventually get home because that's
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.000]   where you feel rested.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.760]   That's where you're not thinking about anything.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:17.040]   You went out and did experience some tremendous stuff, but at some point, you want to go home,
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.200]   right?
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.600]   Because that's where the loved ones are.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.040]   That's where you feel rest.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.320]   That's where you're relaxed.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.680]   That's where you feel safe.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.280]   You can see the Israelites are thinking while they're wandering in the desert, they're
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.040]   vulnerable because they're not protected.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.080]   Enemies can come and just squash them anytime they want.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.880]   So for any nation, their dream would be to go into a city where they're fortified with
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.000]   walls and protected.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.360]   So they were probably dreaming this, like, "Oh, we're almost home.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.880]   We're almost home."
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.400]   And Moses reminds them, "That is not your home.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.400]   God is your dwelling."
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.120]   You know, I read this years ago.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.880]   You know, some of you guys may remember it.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.880]   Most of you guys weren't here when I read it, but it made me think about, again, that
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.720]   song from Michael Buble.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.360]   Last time I mispronounced him.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.600]   I said Michael Bubble, but it's Michael Buble.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:14.240]   I'm not going to read the whole thing, but I thought it was appropriate for the text
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.960]   that we're looking at where he talks about missing home.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:24.520]   You know, "Another summer day has come and gone in Paris and Rome, but I want to go home.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.120]   To be surrounded by a million people, I still feel all alone.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.120]   Just want to go home.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:37.440]   Oh, I miss you, you know, until another winter day has come and gone away in either Paris
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.760]   or Rome, and I want to go home.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.760]   Let me go home.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.560]   And I'm surrounded by a million people.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.520]   I still feel alone.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.520]   And let me go home.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.280]   Oh, I miss you, you know."
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.600]   You know, I think that song is popular.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.040]   Obviously, it's a catchy tune, but, you know, that's one of the songs that I have on my
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.920]   iPhone that when I'm flying and I'm away and I want to kind of block out the noise, that's
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.520]   usually the first song that comes out.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.520]   "I want to go home.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.520]   I want to go home.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.520]   I want to go home.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.520]   Because I'm tired, you know?
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.600]   I want to sleep on my own bed, right?
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.680]   I want to eat my wife's cooking."
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:17.840]   And so that song, to me, it kind of reminds me not only about my home in Irvine, but it
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:24.560]   reminds me of the groaning in my heart that no matter where I am, that there is a longing
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.880]   to go home because our home is not here.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:37.040]   In Hebrews 4, 8 through 9, the author says, "If Joshua had given them rest," meaning,
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.360]   as Joshua led the nation of Israel into the Promised Land, if Joshua gave them that rest
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.260]   that they were looking for, he would not have spoken of another day after that.
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.480]   So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.360]   In other words, they were looking to go to the Promised Land because they thought they
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.160]   were going home, but if that was truly their home, it would have been finished.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.280]   But Joshua speaks of another place.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:08.400]   Hebrews 11, 13 to 14, these men and women of faith who wandered out and gave their lives,
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:15.140]   if their desire was to be home to the Promised Land, many of them never made it.
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.740]   God didn't keep his promise, in other words.
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.700]   This is what it says, "All these died in faith without receiving the promises, but having
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.980]   seen them and having welcomed them from a distance and having confessed that they were
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:31.020]   strangers and exiles on earth, for those who say such things make it clear that they are
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:35.160]   seeking a country of their own."
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.860]   Every single one of us, the scripture says, the Holy Spirit's been deposited and is groaning
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.260]   on our behalf, interceding for us.
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.240]   What do you think the Holy Spirit is praying for us?
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.620]   When he groans on our behalf, what do you think he's groaning on our behalf for?
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.080]   So that you can be comfortable?
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.580]   So that your business will be successful?
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.820]   So that you can live a little bit longer instead of dying at 30, that you died at 90?
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:05.220]   What do you think he's primarily deposited in us for?
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:11.940]   He's groaning to bring us to the Father, to actualize the salvation that was started when
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.840]   we accepted Christ, and it's going to be fulfilled in glorification.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.260]   So the Holy Spirit is groaning for what?
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.060]   To take us home.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:31.980]   A Christian has the Holy Spirit constantly reminding us, "This is not your home."
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:38.660]   And the frustration with Christians sometimes is that we try so hard to make this our home
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:43.220]   when the scripture clearly keeps telling us, "This is not your home."
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:48.900]   And we're jumping from relationship to relationship, from group to group, from event to event,
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.980]   to find rest and peace.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.020]   But this is not our home.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.740]   That's what Moses is trying to remind the nation of Israel.
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.300]   You're going to go into the promised land.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:05.300]   You are going to have mountains around you, but that is not your rest.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.180]   The Lord your God, He is your refuge.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.820]   Again that's why Paul says in Colossians 3, 1-4, "Therefore you have been raised with
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.820]   Christ.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.420]   Keep seeking the things above."
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:21.420]   He doesn't say you've been raised with Christ, now make the best of it on earth.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.720]   He doesn't say that.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:28.180]   Now that you've been raised with Christ, now that you know that you're not from here, look
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.660]   up where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.080]   Set your mind to the things above, not on the things that are on earth.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.080]   For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.940]   When Christ was your life, our life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.940]   glory.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:53.460]   In other words, our life, while we're here, will always feel like it's not our home, because
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.700]   it isn't.
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:01.220]   No matter how comfortable you are, no matter how financially well off you are, if you are
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:06.620]   a born-again Christian and the Holy Spirit is indwelling in you, there will always be
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:13.700]   a sense of discontent with this world, because it wasn't meant to be our home.
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:19.460]   Just like the promised land for the nation of Israel was only to ultimately point to
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.780]   the coming of Christ.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.780]   It was to teach them about the inheritance.
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.780]   It was to teach them about glory and the new heavens that are going to come, but it was
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:32.220]   only a shadow, and that was not their reality.
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.940]   Philippians 3.20, it says again, "For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:41.940]   we eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.300]   How long was this?
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.380]   This was not something new.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.060]   He says He's our refuge in all generations.
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:52.780]   In other words, before Egypt, during Egypt, and after Egypt, the Lord has always been
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.060]   your refuge.
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.060]   Your home was never the promised land.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.140]   Crossing over this mountain is not going to get you to your home.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.780]   The Lord has been your refuge in all generations.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.340]   Before the mountains were born, or you gave birth to the earth and the world, even from
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.420]   everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:16.620]   To us, mountains are a place that we hike, and we go to the peak, and we take good selfies,
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.940]   and we put it on our Instagram, and so we think of mountains as a beautiful place to
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:21.940]   visit.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:26.580]   Think about what mountains were for them at that time.
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.620]   Mountains were natural barriers to protect them from their enemies.
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:37.380]   So if you look at the ancient civilizations, typically they are surrounded by natural walls
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:42.020]   because it protected them from enemies so they could see them coming, you know, standing
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:48.240]   up on the top, and even if they did come, they would have the higher position.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.860]   So for them, the mountains, Moses is on this side of the mountain looking, saying, "We're
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.520]   going to cross over to the promised land," but he says, "Before the mountains were ever
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.600]   created, God was."
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.660]   God was your refuge.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:01.660]   He was your protection.
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.320]   It's not the mountain.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.760]   Another thing that the mountain represented for the ancient people was that they believed
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.640]   that if they climbed the mountains, that they would get higher, and they would be able to
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.200]   be closer to God.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.680]   So a lot of the idols, idol worshippers, set up temples and places in where?
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.360]   High places.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.380]   And God told the nation of Israel that, "Do not worship me like the pagans do," and set
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.880]   up altars in where?
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.800]   High places.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.640]   Because they thought that if they kept on climbing, that they would somehow get closer
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.640]   to God.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:37.580]   So the mountain naturally represented to them a place of refuge and a place where they thought
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.760]   that they could bring themselves higher and get closer to God.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.800]   And that's the context in which Moses is saying, "Before the mountains were born, you gave
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.800]   birth to the earth."
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.160]   The only reason why these mountains are even here is because the God who created it is
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.160]   there.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.840]   And the moment we forget that, and we begin to give credit to the creation rather than
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.200]   the creator.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.720]   Think about all the magnificent places that we visit, whether it's big cities or, you
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.440]   know, again, you go to Beijing, they have the Great Wall.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.600]   Some of you guys may have been there multiple times.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.760]   We go there and people spend thousands of dollars to visit, to look at it, and be marveled
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.040]   at this pile of rocks.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.840]   I've been there so many times because that's exactly what it looks like to me.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.160]   But it's man-made structure that, you know, like, what is that?
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.160]   I forgot.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:35.800]   1,500 miles and 500 years to build, and then never acknowledging the mountain that it sits
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.720]   on.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.280]   And it's not even the mountain.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:45.520]   It's the God behind the mountain and the man that God created who had the intellect and
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.560]   the will to be able to put those stones together.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:56.000]   But like it says in Romans chapter 1, you know, that man's sin is we give credit to
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.600]   the creation rather than the creator.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:03.860]   We make creation our refuge rather than the one who created it.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.160]   And that's the first thing that he reminds the nation of Israel.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.520]   Before we get into the promised land, it is not sin to be comfortable.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.140]   God was going to protect them.
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.580]   It is not a sin to have finances.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.000]   It is not a sin to have good retirement.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.740]   But the moment that that becomes our refuge, the blessing that God has given us can easily
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.380]   turn into a curse.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.640]   And that's what Moses was projecting.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.040]   If we forget who God is, this promised land that he's taken us into can easily turn into
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.560]   a curse.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:42.240]   Second thing that he reminds us, man's fate is ultimately in God's hands.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.680]   He says, "You turn man back into dust and say, 'Return, O children of men.'"
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:51.000]   In other words, God is in charge of your life.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.480]   You know, one of the most foolish teachings of this world, and every time you hear somebody
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.360]   who's experienced any kind of success, do you have anything to say?
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:07.560]   And they say, "Well, believe in yourself and you can do anything."
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.480]   Order trash.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.600]   And usually, if you've lived long enough, you know, nobody believes that.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.360]   Only young children believe that.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.200]   Like, anything?
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.680]   I can be like LeBron?
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.600]   No.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.920]   Not going to happen, right?
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.140]   If you believe in yourself, you can achieve anything.
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.480]   You can't grow a centimeter.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.720]   It's like, "Oh man, I want to be a little bit taller."
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.040]   No.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   You can't.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.680]   You don't have that control, right?
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.720]   I mean, even when we make promises, "I'll see you tomorrow," right?
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.160]   You're making a bet.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.800]   And from now until then, nothing's going to happen.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.480]   You're just kind of taking the probability of how things have been, and the possibility
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.840]   that I may be able to make it there is high.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.380]   That's not the best that we can do because we can't control what's going to happen.
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.900]   So it's like, "I'll do my best to be there tomorrow."
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.000]   That's about as honest you can get.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.020]   To think that somehow we can control our destiny.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.500]   It's a lie.
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.500]   It's a deception.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.060]   So the first thing that he says, "Remember who God is.
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.060]   He is your refuge."
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.420]   In other words, He is your home.
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.460]   He is your goal.
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.740]   And you already have Him.
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.620]   Don't forget that.
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:32.560]   But ultimately, God is ultimately in charge.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.560]   Not you.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:38.040]   Think about how much of our frustration lies when we start to think, "Only if I had this.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.080]   Only if the circumstances were different.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.060]   Only if I had more money.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.260]   Only if I had this.
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:49.340]   Because if my circumstances were different, I would have more control over my fate."
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:54.120]   And we forget that God is absolutely sovereign.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:24:00.020]   In John 10, 17, 18, "For this reason, the Father loves me because I lay down my life
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.700]   so that I may take it again."
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.860]   Only God can say that.
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:10.200]   No human being can say, "I lay down my life and I take it back up when I please."
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.380]   You didn't choose to come into this world.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.760]   And when it's time for you to leave, you're not going to choose to leave either.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:21.440]   God has ordained that time.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.600]   It is appointed for all men to die once, and after this comes judgment.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.000]   Who appointed your death?
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.220]   God did.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.220]   He appointed your life.
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.640]   He appointed your death.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.880]   The reason why He's telling us all of this is as we are going in, they may be thinking
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.480]   like, "Now that we have what we want.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.400]   Now we have the promised land.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.560]   We have the protection of the mountains.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.820]   We're in charge of our own fate.
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:46.120]   Now let's work hard and make something of our nation."
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.640]   He's reminding them, "You don't have that power.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.640]   Only God does.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.960]   God is the only one who is absolutely sovereign."
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.760]   That's why in Philippians chapter 4, 6 through 7, Paul says, "Be anxious for nothing, but
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.760]   in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.760]   known to God."
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:09.200]   In other words, your anxiousness is because you haven't surrendered to God.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.000]   And why would you give Him thanks before He answers your prayer?
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.120]   Because you're acknowledging that He is the one who has power over me.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:23.600]   Whatever circumstance you're in, how much of our anxiousness is because we don't have
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.680]   control over our circumstance.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.440]   When we think we're in control, if I do this and I put my money in this account and invest
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.120]   in that, this is going to happen.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.800]   If I switch jobs and do this and that, or, and we have all these things that we've well
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.320]   planned and then all of a sudden you throw a wrench in that, and then we begin to get
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.240]   anxious because we've lost control.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:51.840]   But He says, "When you're anxious with everything, bring your prayers and supplication and thanksgiving
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.400]   to God, and the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:59.600]   and your minds in Christ Jesus."
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.320]   God has us in His hands.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.800]   He has the power of life.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.480]   He has the power of death.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   And until we recognize that, we do our best to live in rebellion against that, even when
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.840]   you don't know it.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.200]   Oftentimes our rebellion against God is not a shaking of fists before God.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:25.320]   It's small decisions that we make that have nothing to do with Him for the purpose of
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.720]   making my life better, to have more control over my life.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:35.080]   I want you to see the two pictures, okay, if you can put that up.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.040]   Okay, all right.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.960]   Anybody know what the name of these things are?
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.200]   Nobody in first service knew either.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.560]   I tried to Google it.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.240]   Basically, it's eggs.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.400]   There's a technical name for it, but we're not that sophisticated.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.280]   It's just eggs, right?
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.520]   I mean, eggs.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.220]   Many of you had eggs this morning, right?
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:05.140]   Did anybody have eggs and say, "Take the shell and you preserved it, and you put it into
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.800]   a carton and it's waiting for you?"
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.840]   No.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.840]   What is an egg shell?
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.960]   It's how you take the yolk and the thing out.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.960]   Trash.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.440]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.120]   That's trash.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.880]   But who would think that that's trash?
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.480]   No.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:26.160]   It was trash before the artist put his hand on it, right?
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.600]   And it was because the artist put his hand on it, and all of a sudden the trash became
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.080]   something to be displayed, right?
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.160]   The egg in itself, the egg in and of itself is trash.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.280]   It's because God put his touch on it, and that's the distinction between you and I and
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.080]   the rest of creation.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:55.120]   God is the one who has the power to bring us from dust and to put us back into dust.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.840]   And the only reason why you and I are distinguished between the rest of the world is because God
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:03.960]   said, "You will reflect me and my glory."
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:09.200]   And that's why the Bible describes our fallen rebellion as falling short of his glory, because
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.240]   if his glory doesn't shine off of us, it's just trash.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.620]   It's just dirt.
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:22.800]   So he's reminding us, he is our home, he is our refuge, and he is our creator.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.800]   Don't forget that.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.360]   Go to the next picture.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.560]   I have another one.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.240]   This is just soda can, okay?
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:35.160]   So if you didn't understand, you couldn't relate with the egg.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.840]   It's just Pepsi can or Diet Pepsi can or Dr. Pepper, okay?
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.960]   So I'm trying to cover all of you, right?
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.120]   And they made it into this beautiful art.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:51.160]   And to the right, it's Christmas season, so those are ornaments made out of cans, right?
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.160]   Trash.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.960]   Some of you are going to drink some soda today, and you're going to throw it into the trash
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.960]   can.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:03.760]   And if you're a really good citizen, you may redeem it for one cent, right?
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.840]   It's just trash.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:12.320]   Until somebody creative and talented put their hand on it and made it into that.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.680]   And that's what he's reminding the nation of Israel.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.460]   God has the power.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.360]   He brought you out of dust, and he can take you back into dust.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.360]   Recognize him and him first.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.880]   Isaiah 64, 8, "But now, O Lord, you are our father.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.160]   We are the clay, and you are our potter.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.060]   All of us are the work of your hands."
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.720]   We're not in control of our destiny.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.120]   God is.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.040]   And that's why we have the greatest value, and we feel the most alive when his glory
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.480]   shines off of us.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:46.440]   Not our work, not our determination, not our intellect, not our experience, not our finances,
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.000]   but when his glory reflects off of us.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.120]   Third and finally, he says, "God is eternal."
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.560]   God could be our refuge, and God could be sovereign, but if he is not eternal, he's
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.320]   not reliable either.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.320]   He's temporary.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.120]   But he says, "No, he is eternal.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:07.280]   God, a thousand years is like yesterday when it passes by."
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.800]   Second Peter 3, 8-9, "But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.320]   with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.280]   It passes by just like that."
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:23.520]   And then he says, "A thousand years is like a watch in the night."
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.440]   You know, when I first read it, a watch in the night is like, "Hmm, a watch in the
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.440]   night.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.440]   What is it?
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.440]   How is time like a watch in the night?"
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.640]   And then again, again, remember the context.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.480]   They didn't have watches back then, right?
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.160]   So that's not what he means.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:40.840]   A watch in the night is describing Jewish time that's divided into three parts, four
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.960]   hours each.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.440]   And so basically, they would say first watch would be the first four hours, second watch
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:50.480]   would be the second four hours, and then they would do that again for the daytime.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.880]   First watch for the daytime, second, and third.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:57.360]   So that's why when you see Jesus' death, they'll describe it in first hour or second
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.360]   hour.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.480]   They're not talking about six o'clock, seven o'clock.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:04.800]   They're talking about that period, right?
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:11.600]   So when he says, "A thousand years is like a watch in the night," think about when time
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.320]   passes the fastest for us.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:20.520]   You ever get so tired and then you say, "Oh, I'm going to lie down for a minute," and
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.680]   you wake up 15 hours later?
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.360]   You missed work?
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.960]   All the apartments that you've made, you had to pay your bills, and now you're going to
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.120]   have to work hard to make up for that.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.640]   And you got a bunch of phone calls angry, right?
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.320]   And you thought it was five minutes, but it passed by so quick.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.720]   That's what he's comparing time with for God.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.960]   That we just lie down and that watch at four hours in the middle of the night that nobody
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.200]   even thinks about, right?
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.560]   Now if you're college students, you might be up during that time, but normal people
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.360]   are asleep between two to six, right?
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.360]   That's the time that we don't really think about.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.360]   It just passes.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.560]   You just lie down, and then during that time, then you just wake up at six, and you don't
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.560]   think about two o'clock, three o'clock, four o'clock, five o'clock.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.680]   That's what he's comparing to God because he is eternal.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.800]   He says he has control over all things.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.360]   He's sovereign.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:17.680]   But in comparison to God's sovereignty, he says in contrast to man, we are like floods
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.360]   who swept away, they fall asleep.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.160]   We're like swept away like a flood, right?
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:30.680]   I mean, you've seen so many videos of what happened in Indonesia even recently.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:35.960]   And I've seen so many video clips about the tsunami that happened years ago where people
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.680]   were just on the beach having fun, and all of a sudden, they see the water being stretched
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.880]   out and you have videotapes of people like, "What's going on?"
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.600]   Next thing you know, they're gone.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.600]   They perish.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.440]   Over 300,000 people just disappeared.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.160]   He said that's like our life.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.040]   It comes and it goes that fast.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.800]   James chapter 4, 13 to 15, "Come now, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go to
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:03.480]   such and such a city and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit,'
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:08.280]   yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.120]   You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes."
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:18.600]   God is eternal, and a thousand years to him is like a watch and a night, but for us, we're
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   like vapors.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.200]   We come in a short period of time and then we're gone.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.980]   We don't have control over that.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:31.960]   We know where this is headed, 100%.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.680]   Whether you die when you're in your 20s, whether you die in your 50s, whether you die in your
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:40.240]   90s, we all are going to die.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:50.000]   He's reminding them, in this short life, don't forget who God is because we don't know.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.560]   That's again, that's the temptation when we're young, that we make all these plans.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.240]   If I go to school and if I make enough money and if I buy a house and if I get married
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.960]   and if I have kids and we make all of these plans, by the time you get to your 30s, 40s
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:08.480]   and 50s, you realize that you don't have as much control as you think you do.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.480]   Then life passes by and then you try to teach your kids things that you've learned, but
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.800]   that they go through the same thing.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.000]   It's so quick.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.640]   I remember years ago, my father was sick and he was sick for over a year and a half before
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.140]   he actually passed.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.840]   So we knew it was coming.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.400]   We just didn't know exactly when.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.880]   We knew it was going to be, it could have been any month, it could have been a year,
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.880]   two years down the line.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.080]   But it took a year and a half just to slowly erode.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:45.400]   But I remember during that period, they had friends and they're about the same age and
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.960]   the guy, my dad's friend was maybe about four or five years older than him.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.800]   So he was older.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.080]   And so whenever they would get together, they would always pray for my dad because my dad
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.080]   was sick.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.520]   He's like, "How's your health?
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520]   What's going on?"
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.440]   And then they were the one always concerned about him.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:07.160]   And then one day we got news that he played a round of golf, came home, said, "Oh, I'm
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.160]   a little tired.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.160]   I'm going to go in and lie down."
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.760]   And then he never woke up.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:17.080]   And we were all like, he was so healthy.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.080]   Never knew.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.080]   It was just time.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.120]   And he went peacefully.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.720]   You and I don't have that kind of control.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.400]   Our life truly is like a mist.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.480]   And I remember even my father at the end of his life, he was so uncomfortable because
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.240]   he knew that the end was coming, but it just wasn't coming.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.800]   And so we were visiting at the nursing home.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.600]   He stayed with Phillip for a period.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.680]   And I remember when he was in the nursing home, he slipped into coma.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.680]   And then the nurses ran into the room and they revived him.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.480]   When he got revived, he wasn't like, "Oh, thank you so much."
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.760]   He said, "Don't do that."
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:57.000]   Because he was ready.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.520]   He served God faithfully all these years, and then he knew that the next place that
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.940]   he was going was much more comfortable where he is now.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:08.240]   And I remember thinking at that time, with all the modern medicine and technology that
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:14.000]   we have, that the only thing that they could have done for him is to prolong his suffering.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.680]   And so we were, obviously, we're sad when he passed, but we're also glad because we
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.400]   knew where he was headed.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.680]   That's our faith for all of us.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:31.960]   And that's the hope that we have for every Christian, every Christian that knows Christ.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.600]   This is not our home.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.600]   This is not our home.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.480]   God is our refuge.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:44.040]   And the sooner we believe that, sooner we pursue that, sooner we give all our energy
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:49.520]   to have that, the happier we will be.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:54.440]   So whatever it is that you have planned for 2019, whatever it is that you want to put
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:59.960]   behind 2018, my prayer that you would keep this in mind.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.840]   And I pray that God would bless you in your business.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.320]   I pray that you would stay healthy.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.740]   I pray that some of these things that we're allowed to have in this life, that you would
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.740]   experience that.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.200]   I pray for that.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:18.760]   But I also pray above all of that, every single one of us would find their home in
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.560]   Christ.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:38.800]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:44.000]   And seeking the Lord's blessing, whatever it is that you are pursuing, whatever you've
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.960]   been frustrated with, again, if it had nothing to do with Christ, to take some time, come
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.960]   before the Lord.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.960]   I laid this before you.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:59.200]   Lord, it's been so hard with my family, my children, my circumstance.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:05.360]   But in the midst of all of this, let me remember that true life is coming and to look to Christ,
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.640]   the author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.100]   So let's take our time to pray as our worship team leads us.
