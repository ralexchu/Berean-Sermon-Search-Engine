[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400]   If you can turn your Bibles to Luke chapter 1, we're going to be looking at Luke.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.200]   Okay, Luke chapter 1.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.600]   Sorry.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.240]   Our brother Luke, is he here?
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.120]   When he was in junior high school, I probably said that about 100 times and he loved it
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.120]   every time.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.320]   I don't know if he's here today.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.160]   Luke chapter 1, I'm going to be reading from verses 1 through 4.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.680]   As much as many have undertaken to compile an account of the things accomplished among
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.720]   us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.040]   and servants of the word, it seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.960]   carefully from the beginning to write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.480]   Theophilus, so that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been taught.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.480]   Let's pray.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.320]   Gracious Father, we pray for your continued mercy.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.680]   Help us, Lord God, to glean from your word what you have intended, that your word that's
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.360]   living and active would cause us, Lord God, to be judged in our heart, to find encouragement,
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.280]   to find strength and greater hope, to know Christ, his crucifixion, his resurrection,
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.000]   and the hope that we have in all the promises that he's given.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.920]   I pray that as we begin this new series, help us, Lord God, to understand the proper foundation
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.560]   so that it would help us, Lord, to see what it is that you have for us here.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.560]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.920]   Amen.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.760]   And I've been kind of sharing with you, I've been going back and forth on which book to
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.240]   cover, and I've always kind of leaned toward Luke, and the reason why I couldn't commit
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.000]   is because Luke's writing in the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts covers about 25
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.240]   to 30% of the whole New Testament.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.640]   So I knew that once we started this that we're going to be here probably until I retire,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.640]   right?
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.920]   So it's going to be a while, so I wanted to make sure that we're going to jump into this.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.240]   And I haven't decided that after we finish this book that we're going to jump into Acts.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.700]   I am hoping that we can.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.800]   I'm not sure exactly how many years we'll be here in the book of Luke, but I wanted
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.400]   to give you some background information, and today is going to be a little bit more informational
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.280]   than you may be used to, but I think this background information is necessary so that
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.160]   once we start jumping into the text and going to the narrative in Jesus' life, it will make
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.240]   more sense to you and you know what to catch and what to look for.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.520]   Just to kind of give you a background on Luke, Luke was Paul's very close companion.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.280]   Typically when we think of Apostle Paul, we think of Timothy, but Luke, according to 2
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.840]   Timothy 4, 9-11, at the very end of his life when he was waiting to be executed, Paul says,
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.600]   "Everybody has left me except for Luke."
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.840]   Let me read what it says, 2 Timothy 4, 9-11.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.280]   "Make every effort to come to me soon, for Demas, having loved this present world, has
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.920]   deserted me and gone to Thessalonica.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.560]   Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.560]   Only Luke is with me.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.680]   Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service."
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.120]   So we know that Luke was not just any companion.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.560]   Not that anybody that's mentioned here is just anybody, but as people were beginning
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.040]   to drop out from his companions, and these are very faithful men that are mentioned,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.360]   many of them mentioned in the book of Acts, he says Luke was with him to the very end.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.200]   Now you have to understand, Luke being with Paul to the very end meant that he himself
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.680]   had to risk his life to be there.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.080]   Because knowing that they claimed Paul to be an insurrectionist, that anybody who was
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.260]   tied to him, they would have also considered to be dangerous.
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.920]   So the fact that Luke was with him to the very end, we already know the character of
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.920]   this man.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.720]   He is very committed to what he believes and risks his life and his health along with the
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.420]   other apostles and other companions.
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.360]   He is a physician by trait.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.180]   Colossians 4.14, Apostle Paul makes that very clear, that Luke the physician sends you greeting
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.680]   and also Demas.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.760]   In other words, he's a medical missionary.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.120]   Typically when we think of the apostles and especially as they are going out and doing
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.840]   ministry and presenting the gospel, they had ability to perform miracles.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.800]   Remember what Jesus said to the apostles?
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.560]   He said, "After I leave, the Holy Spirit's going to come.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.720]   You're going to do much greater work than what you've seen with me because of the Holy
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.960]   Spirit."
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.360]   And we see that in the book of Acts, the power of the apostles wherever they went.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.560]   But having said that, we may naturally think that since they have power, that everywhere
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.520]   they went, they just kind of knock people over and perform miracles every single day,
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.880]   which was not the case.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.760]   Remember Paul says to Timothy not to neglect, to drink a little bit of wine because he was
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.560]   having stomach problems.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.840]   He didn't just lay his hands and then healed him and went.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.160]   He didn't just walk down the street and people just falling out and was fine.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.880]   Those things were specifically reserved for a particular purpose.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.960]   So to have a physician who was walking with you in these missionary journeys, and you
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.920]   can see how useful that must have been for Apostle Paul to travel with them, having stomach
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.800]   problems and diarrhea, whatever that comes with traveling.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.320]   The fact that they had a physician with them was very helpful.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.320]   And I'm just guessing that there's a lot of things that God used that was already within
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.280]   the people that God used for that purpose.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.160]   And again, Luke being a physician was very helpful.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.000]   Him being a physician, he has a unique perspective of Jesus' life and certain things that he
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.200]   highlights, which we'll get to in a minute.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:16.520]   But before we do that, again, as I said, it's helpful for us to understand the distinction
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.240]   between these Gospels.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.080]   Obviously we have four Gospels.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.160]   Of the four, the first three, Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called synoptic Gospels.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.520]   And the reason why they're called synoptic Gospels is because so much of the material
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.800]   and the events that are recorded in the first three books are similar.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.440]   Much of it is repeated in these three Gospels.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.360]   That's why it's called the synoptic Gospels.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.000]   And then the Gospel of John, almost 80% of what's written in the Gospel of John is unique
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.680]   to John.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.600]   And so that too, but the reason why they weren't put together is because they wanted to keep
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.320]   the synoptic Gospels together.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.840]   Then why didn't they start with John and then say Matthew, Mark, Luke, and then Acts?
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.000]   Well the reason why they put Matthew in the front is because Matthew's Gospel clearly
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.640]   connects Jesus as a fulfillment of the prophecy in the Old Testament.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.320]   So the genealogy in the book of Matthew connects Jesus to the Old Testament, so they wanted
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.680]   to make sure that Matthew was put in the front.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:21.160]   And by doing so, Luke and Acts were separated, and John came in the middle.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:27.600]   God uses particular personalities, and you could see that specifically in the Gospels,
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.980]   where even though the author is the Holy Spirit, their personalities and their imprint of who
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.920]   they are is clear in the Gospel.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.400]   So let's look at the book of Matthew.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.120]   Our point is not to get too deep into Matthew, but I think it'd be helpful for us.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.480]   Who is Matthew?
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.120]   He's one of the apostles.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.920]   What was he by trade?
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.660]   He was a tax collector.
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.520]   So if he's a tax collector, what does he have to be good at?
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:02.920]   Some of you are engineers who are good at spreadsheets.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.800]   I've never used Excel in my life.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.040]   I know that sounds weird to you, but I've opened it, but I've never used it in my life.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.040]   I have no use for it.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.240]   I don't know why they invented it.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:20.360]   I would have been a lousy tax collector because I would have collected too much or too less.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.480]   But a tax collector has to be a good record keeper.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.760]   So if you remember in Luke chapter 2, there's a census that takes place, so all the people
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.000]   had to go back to their hometown to take the census.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.520]   And that's why Jesus and Mary and Joseph would have to go back to Bethlehem because
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.880]   they had to be counted.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.280]   But the reason why they had to be counted was for tax purposes.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:50.120]   So the person that would have kept the census or had to have a good record of their genealogy
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.600]   would have been who?
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.720]   Matthew, among the apostles.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.600]   So God uses that record keeping ability.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:04.400]   And so already you can kind of tell just by who's writing this what may be emphasized
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.040]   in the Gospel of Matthew.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:12.920]   Matthew has more quotations of the Old Testament in that Gospel than any other Gospel.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.600]   And it starts out with his genealogy because the purpose of the genealogy is to connect
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:24.320]   Jesus as the fulfillment of the promise that God made, the covenant that he made with Israel,
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.180]   and that the seed of the woman is going to come, and that Jesus is that seed of the woman.
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:33.320]   And so over and over again the theme in the Book of Matthew is that Jesus is that Messiah.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.360]   He's the King.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:41.360]   So you can already tell Matthew's emphasis thematically is the record keeping to clearly
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.200]   demonstrate that Jesus is the fulfillment of these prophecies.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.080]   Mark, he's not a prophet.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.080]   He's not an apostle.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.440]   Do you remember who Mark was?
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:59.000]   Mark was Barnabas's either cousin or a nephew.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.720]   And he was part of Apostle Paul's first missionary journey.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.880]   But as the persecution started rising, Mark just backslid and he fell out.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.640]   So by the time they get to Lystra, they're doing ministry, and Mark just disappears.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:18.440]   So Apostle Paul comes back and then they're starting to collect people for the second
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.680]   missionary journey.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:26.080]   And Barnabas and Paul had such a sharp disagreement about Mark that Barnabas ends up taking Mark
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.480]   and he goes off and does his own missionary journey.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.800]   And then Apostle Paul picks up his disciple and then they go and they separate.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.720]   That's all we hear about Mark in the Book of Acts.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.240]   But we know throughout the rest of scripture that Mark, by Paul's own admission, says he
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.900]   became a very useful person in the ministry.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.600]   We know that Mark was a personal assistant of Apostle Paul.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:56.920]   So Gospel of Mark most likely was accounts that he heard from Peter.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.320]   Did I say Paul?
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.320]   Sorry, Peter.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.320]   Right?
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.640]   Sometimes things fly out of my mouth.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.880]   I'm not sure what I said.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.880]   Okay.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.880]   He's a personal assistant of Apostle Peter.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.200]   Did I say Paul?
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.200]   I said Paul.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.200]   Okay.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.800]   You got to filter what I say.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   Okay?
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.560]   Because sometimes the filter doesn't work here, so you got to filter over there.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.560]   Okay.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.560]   Clearly I meant Peter.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.560]   Right?
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.200]   Peter was an apostle of Peter.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.480]   And so most likely Mark's account, even though he was not an eyewitness, much of it came
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.240]   through Apostle Peter.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:41.880]   So if the account that Mark's giving are things that he probably learned from Mark, Peter,
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.160]   you can see Peter's imprint in the Gospel of Mark.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.520]   What was Peter known for?
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.080]   Putting his foot in his mouth.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.720]   He was a man of action.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.640]   He did first, and then he calculated later.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.720]   He's a measure once, cut twice type of guy.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   Right?
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   He just did it.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.480]   So he's the guy, he's like, "Oh Jesus, is that you?
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.480]   Let me come out to the water."
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.480]   Right?
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.480]   He said, "I'm going to go to the cross."
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.040]   "You can't go.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.040]   How dare you?"
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.440]   And he rebukes Jesus.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.920]   He's a man of action.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.920]   Right?
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:20.520]   So Mark's account of Jesus's life is filled with action.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.720]   In fact, Mark's Gospel is known as the Goal Gospel.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.480]   Because as soon as the Gospel account starts, boom, he gets into his miracles.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.120]   There's one miracle after another miracle after another miracle.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:37.080]   And that's a reflection of Apostle Peter that Mark was taking his things from.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.400]   John, an apostle, what was he known for?
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.960]   John was a hothead.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   Right?
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.520]   Remember in Jesus's ministry, John and James, those two brothers are called sons of thunder.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.200]   And it's not because they were superheroes.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   Right?
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.720]   They're called sons of thunders because they had a hot temper.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.200]   Remember they were walking through Samaria and they wouldn't help them.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.000]   So remember what John and James said?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.520]   "Shall I call out God's judgment and kill these people?"
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.520]   Right?
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.920]   And he would have been a mass murderer if Jesus didn't stop them.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.240]   So they were called sons of thunder because they're quick-tempered.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.200]   And the other thing that John and James is known for, remember when Jesus was going to
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.240]   the cross and he repeatedly told them that he's going to be crucified?
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.720]   Remember John and James, they pulled Jesus aside and said, "Okay, okay.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.720]   You're going to die.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   I get it.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.720]   Right?
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.380]   But can I sit on your left and to your right?"
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.380]   And here's my mom.
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.240]   My mom actually wants to talk to you too.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.180]   And can I sit on your left or to your right?
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:45.040]   So in the midst of pursuing Christ and being his disciple, in the back of their mind, and
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.560]   all the disciples were guilty of this, but in particular these two guys went out of their
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.240]   way to kind of like, "What am I going to get out of it?"
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.200]   So that apostle, those two apostles, right?
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.160]   And John is one of those apostles.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.780]   What are they known for in the New Testament?
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:06.040]   What does John know for the apostle of love?
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.240]   This mass murderer.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:16.960]   This hothead, the sons of thunder meets Christ after the resurrection and he repents and
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:26.040]   this hothead, this man filled with passion and that hatred and self-seeking turns into
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.040]   apostle of love.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.760]   So there's more mention about love of Christ, love of brothers in his gospel and in his
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.840]   epistle than any other writing.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.920]   But what is also interesting was apostle John was known for self-seeking.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.640]   Remember at the end of his life, like, "Let me sit on the left, let me sit on the right."
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:53.760]   The whole gospel of John is to rebuke the nation of Israel who was seeking Christ out
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.820]   for their own gain.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:02.160]   And so it is right in the smack dab in the middle of John's gospel is organized by the
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.120]   seven "I am" statements.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:12.240]   I am the bread of life, I am the light, I am the good shepherd, I am the door, I am
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.600]   the way, the truth, and I am the resurrection, I am divine.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.280]   And so these seven "I am" statements basically takes religious people who are seeking Christ
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.960]   for their own personal gain that maybe if I go to Jesus I can get bread.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.280]   Maybe if I go to Jesus I can become somebody.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.140]   And he says Jesus is.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.140]   He is the destination.
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.240]   It is not through him that I am going to be exalted, it is Christ himself that we are
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.540]   seeking.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:42.300]   And it is relevant because that is exactly who John was before the resurrection.
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:47.540]   So if you read the book of John, his personality and his repentance is scattered all throughout
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.040]   the book of John.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.320]   Everything that he says through the book of John are things he had to learn.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:59.440]   So his personality is imprinted in that gospel where God is exalted as deity and we are just
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.960]   people who are coming.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:13.280]   Luke obviously is a physician and as a physician he emphasizes Jesus' humanity.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.840]   As he focuses on Jesus' humanity there is more details about Jesus' birth than any other
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.840]   gospel.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.280]   He actually comes with a bunch of stuff in there that you don't hear in any other gospel.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.160]   It may be the same account but he gives more detail than any other gospel.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.960]   It's the only gospel that has any mention of his childhood.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.640]   All the other gospels, Jesus is born, John the Baptist appears and he runs into ministry.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:43.360]   But this is the only gospel where we see a preteen Jesus at the temple and we get a small
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.960]   glimpse of what it was like to raise the son of God.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.600]   And the gospel of John is the only gospel that has any mention of his childhood.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.840]   There is specifics of that.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:00.120]   There is more interaction with lost people in the gospel of Luke.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.680]   Meaning that if you look at the other gospels it's thematically organized so it tells us
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.280]   this is what Jesus does and then it proves his identity.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.040]   It proves that he is deity.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:16.160]   And so those things are emphasized but because Luke's gospel emphasizes his humanity there
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.000]   is more detailed information about his interaction with them.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.680]   He didn't just heal and just move on.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.280]   There's a lot of conversations that take place.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.080]   There's people that he interacts with that's not mentioned in the other gospels.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:35.280]   So there's more detailed interaction with lost people in the gospel of Luke.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.960]   When you remember the story of Gethsemane, this is the gospel where it's emphasized where
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:47.480]   Luke the physician describes his prayer as his sweat turning into blood.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.360]   There's more specific descriptions of his suffering on the cross in this gospel than
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.240]   any other gospel.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.920]   Which makes sense because he was a physician.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.280]   There's more medical terms that are used in the gospel of Luke in the book of Acts than
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.000]   any other gospel.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.280]   He's an educated man and as an educated man his Greek was much more advanced than the
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.240]   other apostles.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:18.360]   In fact most of the New Testament is written in Koine Greek.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:25.560]   The common use of Greek at that time in the secular world was classical Greek.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:30.440]   Koine Greek was unique to that period and particular regions where especially for the
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.600]   Jews they use Koine Greek.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:39.200]   I think the best way for me to describe Koine Greek is some of you speak two languages,
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.520]   and if you speak Chinese and English and you have some maybe at home you speak Chinglish,
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:50.080]   or if you're Korean and English you speak Conglish, and so there's unique words that
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:55.040]   you kind of jumble up that's unique and only people who can speak Conglish understand certain
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.360]   things that you say.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:02.640]   So I think the best way to describe it is Koine Greek isn't scholarly Greek.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.320]   It's more for specific like talking.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.240]   It's not the kind of Greek that you would use to have scholarly things written.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.760]   It was more for communication.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:18.280]   Majority of the New Testament is written in the Koine Greek.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:24.200]   Luke writes the Gospels in classical Greek, majority of it in classical Greek, because
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.300]   he's writing it for another reason.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:34.320]   There is a debate whether Luke is Gentile or not, and most people believe that he is,
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:40.080]   but whether he is or he is not Gentile, everybody agrees that the book of Luke was most likely
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.800]   written for Gentiles, that this is the gospel that you probably don't need to have a rich
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.320]   history of Old Testament prophets and things like that to understand everything that's
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:56.640]   going on in the book of Luke, because he's writing it for a Greek audience, Theophilus,
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:02.800]   and so he's known as the Gentile writer for the gospel of Luke.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.520]   Whether he is or he is not, at least the audience is, that's clear.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.060]   Now how does that help us?
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.880]   It doesn't mean that the other parts aren't helpful to us.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.480]   The other gospels are helpful because it connects us with the Old Testament and the prophets
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.720]   as a continuity.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.280]   The gospel of Luke is written specifically for people who may not have understood all
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:27.820]   the customs and traditions and the Jewish laws, and he's trying to explain to them historically
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.080]   what has happened.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:37.800]   Luke's gospel has more details about his female disciples than any other gospel.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:44.600]   In today's age, okay, that's helpful, but you have to understand at that period, it
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.880]   would have been scandalous.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.800]   They would have read that as like, "What?
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.200]   Jesus had female disciples?
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.100]   How can that be?"
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.600]   Remember when Jesus is going through Samaria, that he ends up talking with a Samaritan woman,
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.740]   and the Samaritan woman is actually concerned for him.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.680]   He says in John 4, 9, "Therefore the Samaritan woman said to him, 'How is it that you, being
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.840]   a Jew, ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan woman?'"
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:18.100]   Not only is she a Samaritan, she happens to be a woman, and even as a Samaritan woman,
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.500]   she was an adulterous woman.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.660]   Not only was he a Jew, he was a rabbi.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.600]   So these two would have never interacted.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.120]   In fact, a Jewish rabbi wouldn't be seen in Samaria.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:37.920]   But the fact that he was there, a Jewish holy man, talking to a scandalous Samaritan woman,
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:44.200]   would have been a cause of a lot of rumors and finger-pointing, maybe even disqualifying
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.440]   him as a holy man.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:51.040]   That's why she says, "You're a Jewish man talking to me in broad daylight?"
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.480]   Now compare that to John chapter 3, when Nicodemus comes to see Jesus.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.640]   Nicodemus comes to him at night because he's concerned what his friends are going to think
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.680]   of him.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.960]   So he has to sneak around and ask him in private because he's concerned about his reputation.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.920]   There's a reason why chapter 3 and chapter 4 are right next to each other.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:15.260]   Because it was introducing, like, Jesus humbles the proud and he raises the humble.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:22.500]   And so the Gospel of Luke, there's an emphasis and exposition of the female disciples that
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.200]   we don't see, or more details.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.320]   Whether there's Mary Magdalene or Joanna or Susanna, they're mentioned in the Gospel
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.360]   of Luke in detail.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:37.520]   In fact, the genealogy that is placed in the Gospel of Luke, whose genealogy is that?
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.540]   Is through Mary.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.620]   You have to understand, at that time, they didn't even count the females.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.640]   So when they took a census, when they said there was a certain number of people, that
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.880]   was the certain number of men in that society.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:57.060]   So when we typically think about, there's Jesus fed 5,000, we'll always qualify that
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:03.760]   in our cultural context as most likely 5,000 men, which means the typical number that you
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.640]   kind of see thrown around in the commentaries is somewhere around 20,000 plus, even though
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.560]   it says 5,000 because women and children were not counted in this.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.760]   So when they said 5,000, or when they fed 4,000, it could have been 20,000, it could
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.280]   have been 25,000, the way we would count numbers.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:25.160]   So again, it may be sexist or however our generation may call that, that's how it was
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.960]   in the early church.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:32.300]   That was the culture, that was naturally what they would have accepted.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:37.960]   So to have a genealogy to go through the mom would have been unheard of.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:44.440]   We understand genealogy in Matthew, but the genealogy in Luke itself, a Jew would read
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.640]   that and say, "Ah, this guy could be the Messiah."
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.120]   And there's more details about his interaction with females and his disciples in this gospel
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.080]   than any other gospel.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.920]   More interacting with outcasted people, downcast, who had no voice.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.880]   So he was a strange rabbi.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:12.560]   He was a guy that even after performing all of these miracles would have shook the ground
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.600]   of the Pharisees and Sadducees and other religious leaders and the scribes simply because he
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.200]   paid attention to people who had no voice.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.040]   He spent a lot of time with them, healing them, had them as disciples.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:32.360]   In fact, when Jesus is headed toward the cross and when all the men scatter, where are the
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.200]   females still serving?
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.720]   They're at the cross, at the foot of the cross.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.760]   When Jesus is resurrected, who are the first ones that run over there?
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.840]   It's the females.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:50.240]   See, to us that may not mean much, but for people at that time, if you're trying to make
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.760]   up something and validate something, that would have been the worst thing to do.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.360]   Only reason why you would even record that is because that's exactly what happened.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.800]   So when they come back and they tell the disciples, remember the disciples?
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.480]   It's like these women are saying that they saw the resurrected Christ and Christ is not
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.480]   there.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.520]   It's like, the women are saying that.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:16.160]   They have to go check for themselves because women's testimonies at that time were easily
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.360]   discounted.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.240]   They weren't taken seriously.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.320]   But Luke's gospel blows that out of the water.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:30.160]   Typically in our generation, people have accused conservative Christians, Bible-believing Christians
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:37.360]   of being sexist, misogynist, because we believe in male headship in our church because that's
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.880]   what the Bible teaches.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.800]   But in reality, if you look at Christianity, Jesus is the one who kicks the door open to
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.380]   the females, who give value.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:54.100]   The reason why the whole culture in Judeo-Christian culture has changed is because of what Jesus
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.300]   has done.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.960]   Exactly the opposite of what they are accusing us of today.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.200]   And that's recorded in the gospel of Luke.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.880]   Jesus is presented to us in the gospel of Luke as a sympathetic high priest.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:13.240]   Jesus has three offices, the king, the prophet, and the priest.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:18.400]   So obviously Matthew's gospel is specifically emphasized in Jesus as the king.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.160]   When you have a good king, you have peace.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.840]   You have prosperity.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.520]   There's stability.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.040]   There's justice.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.060]   There's order when you have a good king.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:35.200]   And so Jesus is presented as the king of a new kingdom, his kingdom.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.880]   And that's the gospel of Matthew.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:45.080]   Jesus also is a prophet, and a prophet is sent forth to represent God.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.720]   He says whatever God tells him to say.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.300]   So when you have a righteous and faithful prophet, you have revival.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.300]   People repent.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.300]   They come.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.800]   They get reconciled to God.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:04.480]   But a priest makes a house a home because he's the one who stands in between the sinner
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:09.640]   and a holy God, who is sympathetic to those who are weak, who represents a holy God, and
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:14.160]   he stands in the middle to reconcile people.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:20.040]   And that's why the Bible says that we have a sympathetic high priest who understands
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.280]   our suffering.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.120]   And so he invites us, because he is sympathetic, and he's opened the door to come to the throne
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.600]   of grace with confidence so that we may find help in time of need.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:37.800]   So this sympathetic high priest is presented to us in the gospel of Luke, standing between
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.920]   people who feel like they are not worthy, people who don't have a voice, people who
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:47.960]   feel like they've been discounted, people who've suffered.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:54.040]   He stands in the middle, and he represents a holy, holy, holy God, and invites us into
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.040]   his kingdom.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.680]   That's the gospel of Luke.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.520]   This is a powerful, powerful gospel.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.100]   I'm not saying that any other gospel is not powerful.
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.680]   But the more we understand the details of what it said, we can easily read the gospel
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.320]   and say, "Oh, I know this story.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   I've read this story.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.920]   I've heard a sermon in this."
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.800]   But the more superficially we read it, the more superficial the application.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.500]   And part of the reason why I'm giving all of these details is because when we start
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:28.480]   to jump in and go through, dissect all of this, that you don't read it like, "I know
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.760]   this.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.760]   I studied this.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.960]   I read the commentary."
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:39.880]   Luke himself describes why and how he wrote the gospel in the first four verses.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:45.560]   So let me, again, read a couple of verses here so that we can highlight, again, and
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.240]   this will help us explain the background information, Luke chapter 1, 1 through 4, "Inasmuch as
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.640]   many have undertaken to compile an account of things accomplished among us, just as they
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.780]   were handed down to us by those who are from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:05.220]   of the word, it seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:10.720]   the beginning, to write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus."
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.920]   Just the first three verses alone is radically different than the other gospels because he
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:21.240]   presents it like a term paper, right, like a historian.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.480]   He's not just getting a bunch of facts and information that he heard and just compiling
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.720]   it and it's like, "Here it is."
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:33.340]   He says, "Systematic, consecutive investigation that I'm presenting to you."
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.340]   That's what he says.
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:40.800]   Now you have to remember, he says he went and investigated eyewitnesses.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:46.200]   You have to remember, at that time, by the time that he was writing this, all these eyewitnesses
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.620]   were still alive.
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.360]   So if he's making this up, and we're not talking about two people, we're not talking about
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.600]   three people, hundreds of people.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.520]   In 1 Corinthians 15, 3 to 8, it says, "For I delivered to you as a first important what
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.440]   I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.480]   he was buried and that he was raised on the third day according to the scripture and that
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.540]   he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:14.440]   After that, he appeared to more than 500 brethren at one time."
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.660]   Let me stop right there.
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.400]   Remember how they counted people at that time?
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.080]   It says 500.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.480]   It may be way more than 500.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.720]   It may be in the thousands.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.840]   The number 500 is used here, and that's a number we normally repeat, but the way they
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.080]   took census, it could have easily been more than that.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.240]   He says, "He showed himself to them, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.240]   asleep.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.240]   A few of them have fallen asleep.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.240]   Then he appeared to James and to all the apostles, and last of all, as to one untimely born,
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   he appeared to me also."
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.880]   This is Apostle Paul speaking.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:59.720]   So if Luke is commissioned by a Roman official, a Gentile, a physician to go and accurately
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:06.120]   report and he says, "I'm going to find all these eyewitnesses firsthand, and I'm
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:14.800]   going to jot it down in consecutive order to present to you exactly what has happened."
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:20.680]   If he's making this up, there's, again, I think the accurate number may be in the thousands.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.520]   Could have easily said, "That's not true."
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.720]   Anybody could have said, "Well, where are these eyewitnesses?"
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.720]   Right?
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.080]   500, I mean, there must have been.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.400]   I mean, he walked around for many, many days.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.640]   There must have been a lot.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.680]   And that's exactly what was said, a bunch of them.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:44.080]   He left eyewitnesses of his resurrection.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.680]   And Luke went and discovered.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:51.440]   Now you have to remember at that time, in order for you to travel and find all these
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:57.660]   people, you have to have time, you have to have money, you have to have resources.
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:08.600]   If Luke was commissioned by a high Roman official under his protection, possibly with his support,
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.000]   what does that tell you?
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.680]   Probably more than any other gospel.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.220]   He had the time, he had the resources.
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.960]   And if the office says, "Where do you need to go?"
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.960]   "I need to go to Rome."
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.080]   And he said, "Well, Apostle Paul just got beheaded.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.600]   Don't worry, I got you."
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.280]   You go, "Under my protection."
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.720]   So I don't know exactly if that happened, but if Theophilus commissioned him to do that,
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:37.920]   and he said, "I'm going to take a careful account to get the record of the eyewitnesses
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.400]   that Luke's account is very accurate."
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:50.280]   In fact, people who have tried to discount Christianity targeted specific Luke's writing
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:56.560]   because Luke himself says that everything he says is historically accurate.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:01.000]   So people throughout the centuries who were hostile toward Christianity said, "If I can
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.200]   disprove Luke's writing that historically it's made up, that it doesn't exist, there
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.880]   are certain places that he mentions that only is mentioned in Luke's writing, and if I can
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:16.920]   dig up enough of that and prove to you that it doesn't exist, wouldn't that prove that
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.480]   other things that Luke is saying is also false?"
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:26.680]   The most famous of these antagonists was a guy named Sir William Ramsey, was a historian
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.400]   archaeologist.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:34.920]   And he set out to disprove Christianity as a whole, but his method was to target Luke's
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:40.520]   writings, especially in the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:46.640]   After a lifetime of digging and trying to prove that it was wrong, he became a Christian.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.000]   And the reasoning why he became a Christian was, he said, "I can't believe that a doctor,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   a physician, a historian would take this kind of effort to make everything historically
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.520]   archaeologically accurate, even the sickness, to be medically accurate, and then to be lying
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.600]   about the main thing he's talking about."
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.920]   He said, "Reasonably, it doesn't make any sense."
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:17.000]   In fact, most Christians and non-Christians agree that Luke's writing is one of the most
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.240]   historically accurate.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.160]   Whether you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ or not, they say it's one of
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:27.080]   the most historically accurate documents of that period that we have, period, Christian
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.840]   or non-Christian.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.200]   And that's exactly what Luke says that he is setting out to do.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:39.520]   He's going to take painstaking time and effort to make sure that everything he's writing
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.560]   to you is accurate.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:48.680]   So because of that, he said, "Most likely, he's the most chronologically accurate."
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:55.100]   Now, it doesn't mean that everything that he says happened one right after the other.
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.680]   There isn't clear agreement on that.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:02.040]   But one thing we do know, in my opinion, he made sure that his second book was chronological.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.280]   There's no debate in the book of Acts.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.120]   It's clear what he is saying is consecutive and it's chronological.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:11.560]   So to me, if he took that kind of time to make sure that the second book is chronological,
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.880]   it makes sense that the first book was also, at least a strong effort was made to make
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.040]   it chronological.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.760]   So whenever today we try to find out when did this happen, what was Jesus' timeline,
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:25.300]   when did this miracle happen, usually the first book that we would go for chronology
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.280]   is the book of Luke.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.200]   Now, having said all of that, all of these things are what he says.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.360]   It's like this is how he put it together.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:39.840]   Why he put it together, he mentions in the verse four.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:46.380]   He says, "So that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been taught."
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.660]   To confirm, theophilus, we don't know exactly who he is.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.400]   We know that he is a Gentile, possibly a Roman high official.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:59.240]   His name means beloved of God or a lover of God.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.900]   He may have been a recent convert who wanted to confirm and find more information, or he
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:08.800]   may have just seen what's been going on.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.080]   Christianity by this time has rocked the world.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:18.840]   In about a 20 to 25 year span, this is written somewhere, most people agree, somewhere around
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.840]   AD 60.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:27.360]   So in about 20, 25 years of after Jesus' death and resurrection, that the whole world
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:33.360]   at that time, we're not just talking about that local area, the whole world got rocked.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.160]   And all of a sudden you had Jews and Gentiles who hated each other.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.860]   They couldn't even be in the same city because they felt like it was unclean.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:46.400]   All of a sudden, Christ takes away the barrier and they become one.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.720]   They call each other brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.720]   Tax collector.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:37:00.340]   I mean, tax collectors were considered vilest of the vilest in the Jewish community.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:06.320]   He becomes one of the leaders and he's teaching Pharisees in a church, calling him brothers
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.240]   and sisters in Christ.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:14.580]   We had runaway slaves and the former slave master calling each other brothers and worshiping
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.580]   together.
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.320]   You had the rich and the poor.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:23.680]   You had adulterers and then you had people who got treated, I mean, the whole world got
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.320]   rocked upside down.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:32.200]   The Alpha is probably watching all of this and saying, "What happened?"
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:37.820]   I remember Dr. Harris years ago when he was at our church, he said that you can tell the
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:43.420]   power of whatever hit the earth by the effect.
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:49.320]   So if you see the crater as miles and miles long, you know that whatever hit it was powerful.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:53.320]   A nuclear bomb or maybe an asteroid.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.660]   So if the crater is tiny, you know that the rock that hit it was tiny.
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.260]   If you know that the crater goes miles and miles and miles, that you know that there
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.740]   was something humongous.
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:09.360]   You have to remember, in that short period of time, 25 years, that it would rock the
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.440]   known world at that time to this degree.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.080]   It had to have been a huge, huge blast.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:21.580]   A blast that human beings have not seen up to this point.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:26.000]   If you only grew up in this modern generation after the internet, you have a hard time understanding
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.280]   that.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:37.120]   I remember before the internet, some of you guys in the other fellowship, fantastic six
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.840]   fellowship.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:44.820]   You guys all remember, I remember in 1987, 1988, I was up in Seattle and I attended this
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.680]   church.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:51.280]   And I remember worshiping and the songs that they were singing were songs that I sang in
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.720]   elementary school and junior high school.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.420]   And this was a big church.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:39:00.320]   And in their English ministry, they were singing songs that we stopped singing 10 years ago.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.680]   And I remember coming back down, I was like, wow, it's like, you know, there's so many
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:08.080]   stuff, so much stuff happening where we're at, but it took that long.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.660]   And I wasn't in the countryside.
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.300]   This was one of the biggest churches in Seattle.
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:16.240]   But I remember thinking like, they're 10 years behind everything we do.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.440]   And those of you guys who remember, even up to the 80s, everything that happened, happened
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.560]   in California and New York first.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:29.400]   And then it would gradually spread and it would take 10, 11, 12 years to get to the
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:34.240]   coastal areas and then another 30, 40 years to the Midwest.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.600]   It would just take that long to get information out.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:41.320]   It had to be something fantastic in order for something to penetrate that far.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.360]   And it would take that long.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:53.520]   Today, you just write something on the internet and all of a sudden it goes viral.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.160]   Some of you guys don't know what I'm talking about.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.160]   This is viral right there.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.880]   Is it over?
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.240]   I don't know what this is called, but everybody's doing this.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.520]   Somebody does this and then the whole world is doing this.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.160]   Deepest part of Africa, they're doing this.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.160]   What is this?
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:15.040]   Today, in order for information to spread, it's just instantaneous.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.240]   You put it online, people like it.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:21.320]   Somebody, you know, 15 year old has 30 million followers and all of a sudden it goes viral
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:27.480]   and everybody becomes a cultural trend and the whole world changes like that.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.120]   You want to become an author today?
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.720]   Just write a bunch of stuff and put it on Amazon.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.040]   It's electronic copy.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.020]   Then you can say you're an author.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:43.080]   You get on and start a little blog and type a bunch of things and maybe you're just talented
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:47.280]   and you say something and all of a sudden he's an influencer.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.520]   And then people are reading this thing and people are sharing articles back and forth
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:54.960]   and all of a sudden there's a trend that takes place and everybody's talking about it, even
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.960]   in the remotest part of the world.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.240]   And all of a sudden they have millions and millions of something that's being spread
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.920]   around becoming popular.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:06.480]   But when you go back, there's a 13 year old in his basement who's taking a break from
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:12.920]   playing video games and has become a mass worldwide influencer.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:16.560]   Before the internet, it wasn't like that.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:22.600]   You wanted to become an author, a famous author, it usually started where you're at and you
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.040]   had to have been tested by the group that you're with.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.280]   And people would test you to see who you are.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.920]   And then if you gain enough followers because you've been tested and your influence begins
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:40.040]   to grow, you may get beyond your local area and begin to have influence maybe in the county.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:45.800]   And then after years and years of being proven in the county that you're at, it may possibly
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.040]   go national.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:54.240]   So when we were younger, you didn't have authors who were 20, 25, 30, 35 year olds.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.000]   Usually people who are influencer were in the 70s and 80s.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.880]   But it didn't happen in your 20s because it took time to test everything to get to that
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.880]   point.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:10.240]   So by the time somebody writes something and it begins to spread, you know that there's
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:15.920]   30, 40 years of testing of that person, testing of the knowledge, testing of information before
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.920]   it started going viral.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:23.480]   Today, this is all you need.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.680]   Now why do I say all of this?
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.280]   This is just 30 years ago it was like that.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.120]   This is 2000 years ago.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:40.600]   Just to get, even if a nuclear bomb went off, it may have taken months for that news to
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.720]   get to a certain area.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.360]   2000 years ago.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:49.680]   In 25 years, the world got rocked.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.200]   It got rocked.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:58.300]   And even before Paul would show up in some remote village, they heard of him.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:05.640]   Something happened that a Roman official would commission a physician.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:14.920]   I need record for this to confirm because what I'm hearing is crazy.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:22.920]   Either this was the biggest hoax in human history or Jesus came back from the dead.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:31.800]   So what Luke is reporting is a careful eyewitness account that he recorded of what was happening
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.160]   at that time.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:39.640]   The whole world got rocked and it's been tested for 2000 years.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:45.320]   And it's just as powerful today as it was 2000 years ago.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.120]   So is it worth studying the book of Luke?
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.400]   Yes.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.680]   The power behind these words is not empty.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.320]   It's not just a collection of information that they threw together.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:04.000]   Christ was resurrected and he churned and the history of mankind was reversed.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.560]   The curse of mankind was reversed in Jesus Christ.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.760]   This is the record of that.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.760]   So I hope you guys are ready.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.440]   Whether it takes 10 years or 15 years.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.760]   I don't know how long we're going to be in this thing.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.000]   But our goal is the same.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:28.840]   As we study the careful account that we would come to the same conviction without a doubt
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.800]   because the purpose of conviction is transformation.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.240]   That we would be convicted so that we may be transformed.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:36.440]   Let's pray.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:46.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
