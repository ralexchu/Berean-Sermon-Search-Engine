[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   (applause)
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:17.280]   - Hello everyone, my name is Tim.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.760]   And despite being raised in a Christian home,
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.720]   and though I was baptized as an infant,
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.480]   my salvation story didn't really happen until eighth grade.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.760]   Even though I prayed to receive Christ
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.960]   as my personal Lord and Savior at that time,
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.560]   it was hard for me to grasp the magnitude
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.400]   of that decision at that particular age.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.120]   I realized the shallowness of my faith
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.620]   as soon as I left for college.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.580]   Right from freshman year at New York University,
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.420]   I was confronted with my sin
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.040]   and the worldly temptations of the big city life.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.680]   I got involved in a relationship not centered around God,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.600]   and it wasn't long that I found myself weeping
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.520]   through many sleepless nights because of my sin,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.980]   my guilt, and my shame.
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.760]   Late in my freshman year,
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.560]   a staff member of a Christian campus organization
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.760]   sought me out and shared the truth of God's love
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.440]   and forgiveness expressed through Christ
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.920]   and the need for personal repentance.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.920]   I was utterly broken, and rather than remaining stuck
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.640]   in the vicious cycle of sin and darkness,
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.300]   I confessed my sin and brought it
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.320]   into the light of God's love and mercy.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.320]   It was this experience that set my life
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.080]   on a different trajectory.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.160]   That summer, I had the opportunity to commit eight weeks
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.520]   for a short-term missions project to India,
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.600]   and it was a life-changing experience in one sense
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.560]   because it revealed that before Christ,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.460]   I really had zero ambition.
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.240]   But on this new path set before me,
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.420]   God had given me a real passion
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.760]   to share his love and grace to the world.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.560]   The question of how might I glorify God the most
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.100]   through my living became central to my existence.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.100]   It's a theme that derives from the parable of the talents,
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.720]   the idea of maximizing one's life so that God may see me
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.200]   as his good and faithful servant for his name's sake.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.060]   So holding these words closely to my heart,
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.900]   I was challenged by the vision and the strategy
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.300]   outlined in Matthew chapter 28
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.840]   to help fulfill the great commission
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.460]   of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.940]   And upon graduation, I committed my life
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.260]   into full-time ministry to join those on the front lines
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.580]   of those who are serving the purposes of God
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.600]   for this generation.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.220]   And so it brings me to my life today
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.200]   after serving the Lord in ministry for nearly 20 years.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.340]   I'm walking in a bit of a strange season,
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.580]   not knowing exactly where all this will lead.
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.340]   The one confidence I have and the truth
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.340]   that has remained with me through all of life's journey
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.100]   is that he alone is my unchanging foundation.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.700]   It may seem strange that I've been serving
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.220]   for so many years and yet here I am today getting baptized.
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.940]   In doing so, I adhere to baptism by immersion
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.380]   as consistent with God's holy word.
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.000]   And so today I'm excited to express my union with Christ,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.760]   the portrayal of his death, burial, and resurrection
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.180]   through going down into the water.
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.020]   Thank you.
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.180]   (audience applauding)
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.940]   (water dripping)
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:39.580]   - Tim has asked to stay in the water a little bit
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.660]   longer than normal.
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.300]   So if he doesn't come out quickly,
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.300]   it's because it's his personal request.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.500]   Tim, do you understand when you go into the water,
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.580]   you're being united with Christ in his death
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.420]   and when you come out,
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.100]   you're being united in his resurrected life?
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.940]   - Yes, I do.
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.100]   - And I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.020]   Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.780]   (water dripping)
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.660]   (audience applauding)
