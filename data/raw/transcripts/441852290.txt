[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960]   Good morning, Church family.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.440]   My name is Abby Bechtel, and this is my testimony.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.720]   I grew up in a nominally Christian home.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.800]   My family went to church on Sundays.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.680]   We prayed before every meal and read the Children's Story Bible before bed.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.280]   When I was five years old with my parents, I prayed a prayer that I didn't understand.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.280]   I recall asking for forgiveness of my sins and believing in stories I heard about Jesus
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.000]   Christ, but I don't count this as my moment of genuine salvation because at such a young
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.520]   age I didn't truly understand the depths of my sin.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.760]   I didn't repent or put my faith in my Heavenly Father.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.280]   Throughout grade school and on, I continued living a life of sin.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.320]   I confessed with my mouth that I knew Jesus Christ, but I was lost.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.940]   My family situation worsened, and I took the burden of fixing it upon myself.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.740]   I wanted to live the perfect life, to have the perfect parents, be the perfect student,
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.160]   and I thought I could live by my own strength.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.200]   I tried to hold it together.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.200]   I was prideful.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.200]   I was resentful.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.200]   I was angry.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.720]   I lied to those around me.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.720]   I was bitter.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.040]   I was a sinner, not seeking saving because I didn't recognize my need.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.940]   I had no understanding of the width and depth of my sin and my desperate need of salvation.
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.720]   My life revolved around myself and my family.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.980]   I found security in my capability, and I sought for joy in the respect and admiration of others.
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.080]   This phantom of control came crashing down when I was around 13 years old.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.020]   My parents' relationship was always rocky, and it was brought to the point where talk
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.680]   of divorce was circling.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.680]   And that cloud of ability that was around me disappeared, and I was left with just an
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.520]   empty feeling of anger.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.640]   I didn't know where to turn to.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.840]   But God used these trials in my life for His glory.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.960]   My conversion was by no means immediate.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.760]   After God showed me my incapability to fix my family, I turned to myself.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.960]   Achieving a certain grade, having enough people respect me, or living a comfortable life would
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.920]   do nothing to fix the hole in my heart.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.080]   I had come to the point where I had exhausted the options that the world had to offer.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.660]   For once in my life, I didn't know what to do.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.240]   It was then that I opened my Bible to Romans.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.640]   I read Romans 5, "For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.700]   ungodly.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.440]   For one would scarcely die for a righteous person, though perhaps for a good person one
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.240]   would dare even to die.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.280]   But God shows His own love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.280]   us."
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.100]   Romans 5, 6-8.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.860]   The truth of Scripture cut like a sword into my heart.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.000]   I had never thought intently on the character of God and His love in contrast to my weakness.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.080]   Over the next few weeks, I went back to reading Romans, examining who I was in respect to
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.680]   a holy God.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.160]   My respectable sins as I saw them were an offense to Him.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.800]   Without Christ, without relationship with the one true God, my life was meaningless.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.200]   All of those things were searching for fulfillment outside of Christ.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.760]   I was a sinner in need of saving.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.120]   God opened my eyes through that time to the sorrow that my sin caused Him.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.440]   Scripture made the truth that I had known in my head, that Christ had atoned for my
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.360]   sins, that had eternally separated me from life with God, become a truth that was life-transforming.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.560]   Acts 3, 17-19.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.860]   And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance just as your rulers did also.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.920]   But the things which Christ announced beforehand by the mouth of the prophets, that Christ
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.560]   would suffer, He has thus fulfilled.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.600]   Therefore repent and return so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.280]   refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.320]   One evening that year, I sincerely prayed for forgiveness of my sins.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.860]   It was then that I believed that Jesus, the Son of God, could save me from my sins.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.640]   I knew that I fully deserved the just punishment and separation from God.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.760]   I prayed that I would be dependent on God to define my life and my future.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.900]   It was then that I believed I received the free gift of salvation and eternal life through
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.340]   Jesus Christ.
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.320]   For this salvation, I praise God.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.440]   He used trials in my life to show my sin to me.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.360]   In His kindness and grace, He brought me to repentance.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.480]   This is a story of how God rescued me from my sin.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.940]   He led me out of darkness, and by the sacrifice of His Son, I was justified.
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.380]   He is continuing to sanctify me, and I look towards the hope of being glorified with Him
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.380]   in eternity.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:44.300]   Let me understand when you go into the water, you are united with Christ Jesus Christ.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:55.740]   Amen.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.140]   [APPLAUSE]
