[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   In our series of the church series, and if you look at the bottom of the front side of
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.960]   your program, we have written the fourfold vision of our church, and each one of them
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.560]   starts out by saying our vision is to glorify God by establishing.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.120]   And so I want to read it real quick with you because we're on the third one today, and
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.240]   then we'll get to the fourth one before we jump to the next series of teachings in the
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.480]   text.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.760]   The first and foremost, our vision is to glorify God by establishing a church that engages
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.760]   in God, God-centered worship and not man-centered.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.120]   Number two, a church that equips every believer with God's inerrant word.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.000]   Number three, a church that builds a community through love and accountability.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.080]   And fourth, a church that reaches out to its community with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.160]   So we've been talking about that these are the fourfold vision that we are trying to
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.160]   shoot as a goal.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.760]   And again, this is not anything unique to Beroean Community Church.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.600]   This is something that as we've been studying, we're convicted that these are the things
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.960]   that a church ought to focus on, a God-centered worship, equipping with the word of God, building
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.880]   a community based on love and accountability, and then fourthly, the Great Commission.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.120]   And so as we look at the third vision today, we want to be talking about the importance
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.720]   of the community, why this is so important, why this is a focal point of one of the fourfold
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.120]   focal points of our church.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.480]   So let me pray and then we'll jump into the sermon this morning.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.280]   Heavenly Father, we want to praise you for your goodness.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.720]   And again, we know that our very breath is sustained by you.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.400]   We pray, Father God, that you would be merciful to us as you always are, that we would have
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.000]   ears to hear, hearts, Lord God, that are easily molded, and lives that can be challenged and
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.680]   directed toward a path that leads to Christ.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.720]   Help us, Lord God, to sift through your word and that nothing coming off of this pulpit
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.400]   is contradictory or contradicts anything, Lord God, that your word has to say.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.000]   So we pray for the power of the Holy Spirit to guide and lead us.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.440]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.360]   You know, whenever we talk about the issue of the church, even though I've been a Christian
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.000]   for a while and I've been a pastor for a while, we, you know, not too long ago, we celebrated
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   18 years of our church anniversary.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.160]   And prior to that, I was a pastor for about seven, eight years prior to that.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.880]   And so, you know, I've been a pastor for so long and our church has been around for so
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.040]   long, it's just kind of like, yeah, of course, you know, I'm a pastor and I'm committed to
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.240]   the church.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:52.520]   But growing up, church was the last thing that I wanted to be a part of.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.120]   Some of you guys have come from churches where you've had experiences of split up and bad
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.120]   experiences.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.840]   So naturally, humanly speaking, I would have easily been one of those people that if you
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.720]   were out in the street evangelizing, I would have been one of those people that's like,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.560]   I hate the church, you know.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.840]   You know, it's not Christ or Christianity, it's just, I think the church is filled with
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.840]   hypocrites.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.680]   I would have been one of those people, for sure.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.760]   In fact, when I was younger, my memory of the church, at least not as a little child,
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.920]   but as soon as I began to understand the church, some of the things that I can tell you, the
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.960]   horror stories that I've seen, I've had a close friend of mine whose father was an elder
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.080]   after a Bible study, wanted to physically hit my dad.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.680]   And I remember sitting in there watching this, you know, thinking, man, why do people come
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.680]   to church?
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.640]   And I've heard so many times in the back of the car while my parents are driving, sitting
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.560]   in the back and listening to them talking about what was happening at church.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.240]   And I'd be sitting in there, sitting in the back as a young kid, listening to all of this.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.920]   And again, years of this piling up, seeing the behind the story of people's complaints
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.440]   and attacks on my dad and my parents.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.160]   And I remember one time, I don't remember my dad raising his voice too often.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.720]   My dad was a pretty even-tempered person.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.360]   And I remember one time he was on the phone with somebody else at church, and he was pretty
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.360]   upset.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.360]   And he was going at it with this person.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.920]   And I was listening to what he was saying.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.000]   And basically, somebody said something to my mom, and my dad was on the phone defending
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.520]   her to that person.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.320]   And I don't know the background story behind that, but I remember listening to this.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.520]   And if I knew what it was and what they said, I don't know if I would have been able to
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.080]   control myself.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.520]   So my earliest memories of church, I mean, to say it was negative would be an understatement.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.200]   So as early as I can remember, I remember committing to myself inwardly.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.800]   I never shared this with anybody, but inwardly thinking, as soon as I'm 18, I'm gone.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.680]   Church is not for me.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.840]   And if it wasn't for the grace of God, I would not be here.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.120]   And even after I became a Christian, now I realize the church was the condition that
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.160]   it was at, not because that's what God wanted, but because the church has gone astray.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.680]   So even after I became a Christian, the local church was the last thing that was on my mind.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.320]   I wanted to be a missionary.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.000]   I wanted to work on campus, work with college students.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.080]   I wanted to do all kinds of stuff, but the local church was the last thing that I wanted
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.080]   to commit to.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.160]   So here I am, you know, so many years later, I'm a pastor of a local church.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.600]   How did I get to this point?
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.720]   It wasn't anything supernatural.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.860]   It wasn't like, "Oh, I went to this church and I started to see what a healthy church
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.380]   looks like and like, oh, I see, what I saw was wrong and this is right."
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.380]   There was no experience.
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.240]   There was no eye-opening experience that happened to me.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.900]   Basically what happened was, as I was teaching through the Bible, and it wasn't really even
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.900]   in seminary.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.000]   I'm sure in seminary I was taught often the importance of the local church, but to me
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.160]   it was just, you know, okay, you know, that's what you say and that's what I heard.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.520]   But after I became a pastor, I started preaching through the Bible.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.240]   I started preaching through Philippians.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.240]   I started preaching through John and then went to Romans.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.400]   And so I was just kind of working my way through the New Testament and then started to study
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.960]   and do quiet time through the Old Testament.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.240]   And certain things that I thought about Christian life started getting challenging.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.720]   I realized a lot of my thinking wasn't biblical, even though that's what I was taught, even
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.480]   though that's what I was practicing for years.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.880]   It just wasn't biblical.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.920]   And one of the key things that I learned about Christianity is about the church.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.000]   And again, typically we tend to think like, well, prayer is important, evangelism is important,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.660]   discipleship is important, but the church is kind of like, you know, like fellowship.
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.780]   Those are for we Christians, like who don't really want to pray and like, you know, level
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.520]   one Christians are the ones who are doing missions.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.160]   But the church, you know, that just, that's just like nominal people.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.520]   They don't come and hang out and want a fellowship.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.300]   But I, as I was sifting through the scripture and I realized just how important the church
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.640]   is to God.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.080]   And I, one of the key things that I learned, one of the first things that I learned was
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:22.180]   God sees all of us in a context of a church, not just individually in a desert, in the
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.180]   church.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:28.780]   Now, I'm going to show you a few things and hopefully you can see what I'm, what I'm getting
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.780]   at.
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.140]   Turn your Bibles with me to Joshua chapter 7, 16 to 18.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:43.940]   This is a passage where the Israelites are about to conquer Jericho and God tells the
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:49.500]   nation of Israel, I'm going to deliver this city to you and all you have to obey me.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:54.160]   But when you go in, this one stipulation is everything in this city is under a ban.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.160]   It's under a curse.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.500]   So, I don't want you to touch anything.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.700]   Well, one of the Israelites from the tribe of Judah named Achan thought that he was going
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.020]   to be smart and say, you know what God, maybe God didn't really mean everything.
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.580]   You know, there are some good things here that I can take away and benefit from.
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.100]   So, instead of obeying God, he decides to go and take some of the, some of the prized
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.380]   possessions and keep it for himself.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.260]   He doesn't tell anybody.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.180]   But because of that particular sin, they end up going to the next city to conquer and it's
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.540]   a much smaller city.
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.020]   They should have, if they were able to conquer this big fortified city, this tiny little
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.300]   city up in the hill should have been a piece of cake for them.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.780]   So they don't even send their whole army.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.660]   They only send 3,000 of them.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.700]   And then because of this particular sin, God withdraws his favor and then they get attacked
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.500]   and many Israelites die as a result.
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.340]   So God speaks to Joshua and the leaders of Israel and say, this is the reason why this
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.580]   happened is because you did not obey me.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.100]   Your strength does not come from your army.
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.940]   Just like I told you to meditate on my word, do not turn from it to the left or to the
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.540]   right if you want to be successful.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:07.540]   Well, Joshua chapter 7, 16 to 18 is a scene where God picks out Achan for the purpose
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.140]   of judgment.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.500]   But look at the way he does it.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.500]   Joshua 7, 16 to 18.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.500]   This is the way he does it.
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.500]   This is a huge drama.
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:20.660]   It says, "Early next morning, Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes and Judah was
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.660]   taken."
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.940]   So again, they're pinpointing Achan, this one particular person.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.260]   But the whole nation of Israel had to come out.
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.400]   We're not talking about 20, 30, 40 people.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.000]   If any of you have ever tried to organize a group of people, even 10, I get 10 of you
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.640]   guys get together and say, "Hey, let's go eat somewhere."
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.320]   You know what kind of headache it is just to organize even 10 people, right?
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.120]   And it's like you run a picnic with 100 people.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.600]   And I'm very thankful for our family ministry team who's organizing the picnic.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.120]   But just to get the people to move from this table to this table sometimes takes 20 minutes.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.120]   You know what I mean?
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.240]   And we're going to eat over here.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.240]   I said we're going to eat over here.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.360]   Like where are we eating?
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   Over here.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.360]   When are we eating it?
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   Now.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.360]   Right?
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.920]   Just to get these people to move from here.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.600]   Why this huge drama to pinpoint this one person?
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.640]   The nation of Israel is taken.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.360]   And then after that, the clan of Judah is separated because that's the tribe that he's
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.360]   from.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.520]   So even the clan of Judah is now a small group of people, right?
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.520]   It's probably thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.560]   They come forward.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:33.560]   And then he took the Zarahites within the tribe of Judah, this family group, the Zarahites.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.760]   He had the clan of Zarahites come forward by families.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.560]   And Zimri was taken.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.520]   So you see this drama of Israelites, the tribe of Judah, the Zarahites, and then the Zimri,
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   right?
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.000]   So Joshua had his family come forward man by man, one by one.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.080]   And Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zarah, the tribe of Judah was taken.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.960]   That's a lot of drama to pinpoint one guy, right?
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.640]   It would have been easy.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.080]   It's like, where does Achan live?
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.080]   He's in that tent.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.080]   Go get him.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.080]   Comes back.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.080]   Judges him.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.080]   The end, right?
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.440]   This whole drama of all the nation of Israel coming out, and then the Judah, and then the
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:17.960]   Zarahites, and then the Zimri, and then his family, and then one by one, and then Achan.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.240]   See, this is not unique to this scene.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.280]   If you study the Old Testament, every single individual is connected to his family and
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.020]   his tribe.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.960]   So whenever they identify their God, they always say the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.440]   Jacob, meaning the connection that they have.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:43.440]   And you'll notice that every individual in Israel is connected to a community.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.840]   And God basically was teaching the nation of Israel, because of this one man sin, Israel
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.360]   is guilty that each tribe is culpable.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.720]   And the closer they get to him, they're more culpable.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.080]   But the whole nation was guilty because of this one man.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.080]   In fact, if you see all throughout the New Testament, and Old Testament, and the New
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:08.520]   Testament, you'll see that that's exactly how God sees us.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.200]   Anybody who's a parent will understand this.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.680]   Like as a child, it's hard to understand.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.080]   As a child, we kind of look at it as like, "Oh, I'm good.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.080]   I got a good job."
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.080]   Right?
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.560]   But as a parent, it's not enough that my first son is doing well.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.600]   I want my second son to do well.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   And I want my third son to do well.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.600]   And my daughter.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.600]   I can't forget her.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.600]   Right?
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.360]   So as a parent, you never, it's never individual.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.040]   Like I don't feel well until our family is well.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.800]   I don't feel rested until everybody is home.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.160]   It's not just one.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.600]   So if my children ask me, like, "What can I do for you?"
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.520]   The first thing that I would think of is, "Take care of your brother.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.480]   Be good to your sister."
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:58.320]   Because I won't be at peace until everybody is okay.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:04.200]   And you see that God as the Father of the nation of Israel always sees them as a unit,
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.200]   as a family.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:12.560]   And if you come to the New Testament, you can't practice Christianity outside of a devoted
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.440]   commitment to a community.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.000]   Look at the language of the New Testament, Romans 12.10.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.040]   Be devoted to one another.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.040]   Be devoted.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.800]   He doesn't say just casually, just kind of, "I attend this church."
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.000]   He says, "No, be devoted to one another."
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Romans 12.16.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.520]   Live in harmony with one another.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.920]   Romans 16.16.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.880]   Instruct one another.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.480]   Galatians 5.13.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.000]   Serve one another.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.480]   Ephesians 5.21.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.360]   Submit to one another.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.680]   Colossians 3.16.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.760]   Teach and admonish one another.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.440]   First Thessalonians 5.11.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.440]   Encourage one another.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.440]   Hebrews 10.24.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.800]   Spur on one another.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   First Peter 4.9.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.760]   Offer hospitality to one another.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.760]   First John 1.7.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.000]   Clothe yourself with humility toward one another.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   First John.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Hold.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   First John.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Love one another over and over again.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.320]   And then 2 Timothy 2.2.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.760]   He says, "Flee the evil desires of your youth.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.480]   Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, along with those who call on the Lord out
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.660]   of a pure heart."
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.000]   Even when we practice communion in 1 Corinthians 11, what does it say?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.840]   He who eats and drinks off the table without acknowledging the body of Christ, he eats
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.600]   and drinks what?
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.520]   Judgment upon himself.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.900]   It wasn't meant to be done in isolation.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.960]   It wasn't meant to be done by yourself.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.800]   It was in the context of the body of Christ.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:41.380]   A Christian cannot be obedient outside of a devoted relationship with the body of Christ.
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:50.260]   Again, I can sit here and spend probably the rest of this month, maybe even year, talking
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:55.340]   about this because almost every text in the scripture in the New Testament is written
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.780]   in the context of a local church.
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.820]   If you look at 1 Corinthians chapter 12, or so, you don't need to turn your Bible there,
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.420]   it's about the body of Christ, and how God has given each person different spiritual
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.540]   gifts.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.540]   Why didn't He give it to everybody?
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.380]   Why didn't He give different spiritual gifts as soon as you became Christian that you're
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.700]   able to do everything?
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:23.460]   He says some, He made eyes, tongue, head, feet, mouth, and each one is vitally connected
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:29.380]   to one another that a mouth, independent, is useless unless it is connected to the head.
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:33.860]   A feet is useless unless it's connected to the hands.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.460]   And God deliberately made it that way so that we would not be able to function without one
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.460]   another.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.460]   In Ephesians 4, 16, that's exactly what it says.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:48.620]   From Him the whole body, from Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:56.100]   ligament grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.100]   So that's the body of Christ.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:03.820]   The body of Christ is His physical presence on earth.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.620]   And we can't function as a Christian.
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:10.180]   So somebody says, "Well, you know, as Christians, you know, I can be a Christian.
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.740]   I don't have to be a part of a church."
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.100]   I say, "Yeah, you could go to, you may be able to go to heaven, but it's just not like
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.660]   saying, 'I'm a Christian, I don't have to read the Bible.'"
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.100]   You're right, you can be a Christian without reading the Bible necessarily, but you wouldn't
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.100]   be an obedient Christian.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.100]   You can be saying, "Well, I don't have to pray."
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:32.900]   I say, "Well, you could technically, but you wouldn't be an obedient Christian."
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:37.300]   You can't practice, you can't be reading the Bible and practicing Scripture outside of
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.820]   the body of Christ.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:44.780]   So it's kind of like, that's why when an individual is separated from the body of Christ, there
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.420]   is no application to Scripture.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.500]   The only thing that we look for in Scripture is encouragement.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.900]   How to raise my kids, right?
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.900]   How do I find encouragement in this difficult world?
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.340]   How do I do this?
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:03.460]   The book is nothing more than a how-to for my own individual life.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.900]   So if we're going to the Scripture, it doesn't come alive because I'm not committed to obey
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.500]   all that it has.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:15.100]   Again, it's no different than reading an instruction manual of how to build.
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.780]   Like I say, you buy an IKEA furniture and you have the instruction manual, but you have
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.500]   no intention of building it.
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.500]   You know, you just like reading it.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.860]   And then after a while, it's just going to get old.
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.780]   It's like, "Well, you know, I've read this before."
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.820]   Just getting old.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:34.300]   We live in a culture where if things don't fit us, we try to redefine it.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.620]   Because again, remember we talked about that?
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.300]   The beginning is God-centered worship, not us, but Him-centered.
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.660]   Sometimes we make the church a place for us.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.420]   Some of you guys may remember, remember the TV show Cheers?
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:54.140]   All right, three people, three people.
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.020]   So I don't know why.
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.220]   The earlier service had more older people, so they agreed.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.420]   Okay, so Cheers was the popular sitcom before Friends.
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.420]   Right?
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.580]   Okay, yeah, it was a long, long time ago.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.140]   In the beginning.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:16.580]   So Cheers was a sitcom, and I remember at that time when that sitcom came, and if you
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.980]   watch Cheers now, it's so tame.
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.700]   You know, it's, I don't even know if they would rate it PG.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.900]   But I remember when this TV show was popular, there was a debate in the Christian community
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.740]   thing, should Christians be watching this because it's so raunchy.
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.740]   You know, because they were talking about, you know, sexual encounters very openly.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:40.780]   And then prior to this TV show becoming popular, it was all family-oriented, like the Cosby
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:45.460]   show, Family Ties, and Family Other Stuff.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.460]   Right?
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.460]   I can't remember.
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.300]   But it was all family-oriented, it was pretty wholesome.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.100]   This show came on, and it became really popular.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:58.700]   And I think part of the reason why it was really popular, it showed a group of friends
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.060]   at a bar where they had community.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:07.500]   And this is how the theme song of that sitcom goes.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.380]   At least the beginning part says, "Cheers.
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.660]   Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got.
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.540]   Taking a break from all your worries sure would help a lot.
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.300]   Wouldn't you like to get away?
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.300]   Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.580]   And they're always glad you came.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.540]   You want to be where you can see our troubles are all the same?
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.700]   You want to be where everybody knows your name."
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:40.380]   I think this particular sitcom tapped into a longing in our generation.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.620]   Because we no longer have communities in our neighborhoods.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:49.580]   In fact, with so many families being torn apart, there's really not even communities
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.620]   even in our homes.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.300]   And there isn't much community when you go to work.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.740]   You go into a cubicle, do your job, cock in, cock out, and you come home.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.740]   So less and less.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:01.900]   And again, part of the reason why Facebook and all this social media is so popular is
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:08.300]   because there is a longing, even if it is superficial, there is a longing for connection.
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:13.940]   Now at the core of what this song says, it is not wrong.
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.920]   In fact, that's what a church ought to be.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.880]   But here's the danger of this, if we're not careful.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.260]   That we make church to be about this.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:29.540]   A place where we can go where everybody knows my name, I feel connected to people.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.020]   That we're all going through the same struggle.
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.500]   There's nobody judging anyone.
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.780]   There's no push to anything, that I feel accepted exactly the way I am.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.100]   And everybody knows my name.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.980]   And they're always glad I came.
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.620]   No matter what I'm doing, no matter where I'm going, no matter what my life looks like,
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.580]   they're always glad I came.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.500]   Wouldn't that be a great place to be?
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:56.500]   And I believe that, again, whether it's cheers, whether it's friends, or whatever sitcom that
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.780]   came, there is a longing in our generation.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:04.260]   And this song kind of captures that.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:09.860]   And again, the danger of this being applied to the church is that more and more we're
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:19.980]   redefining the purpose and intent of the church based upon what our generation desires.
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:27.780]   Again, like I said, at the core of it, in and of itself, it is not necessarily wrong.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:33.780]   When we begin to redefine church based upon our generation, our need, and who I am, what
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.300]   I want.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:39.900]   And the truth of the matter is, it works.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.180]   If you build a church where people feel connected and love and accepted and not judged all the
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.700]   time, it grows.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.540]   You don't have to have the best sermon, you don't have to have the best organization,
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:54.140]   but if people feel loved and accepted, no matter what, it will grow.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.100]   Because that's the longing of our generation.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:01.260]   I'm pretty sure that's a longing that you have in your heart as well.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:06.740]   But we need to be careful that whatever churches that we're building, that we're building because
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.700]   this is what the scripture tells us what the church is.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.220]   So I'm going to do an exercise with you real quick.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.060]   So take out your program.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.060]   Take out your program.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:21.100]   If you have pencil or pen, I want you to do something for me as an exercise.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:30.060]   I want you to draw one triangle, three square, and a rectangle.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.940]   If you know what I'm doing, don't say anything.
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:38.940]   Draw a triangle, three squares, and one rectangle.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.300]   You can draw on the program.
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.060]   It is not blasphemy to do it.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.700]   So there's nothing sacred on that sheet that you can't mess up.
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.740]   So if you don't have a paper, you can do it.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:53.260]   One triangle, three squares, and one rectangle.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.500]   Everybody did it?
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.460]   You're all done?
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.020]   Okay, can you put up the picture for me?
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.820]   Okay, is that what you got?
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.820]   Why not?
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:09.580]   I told you to draw a triangle, square, and a rectangle.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.580]   Right?
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.340]   All right, you can turn the light back on.
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:15.340]   All right.
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.380]   So you all failed then.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.380]   You all failed.
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.380]   Okay.
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:26.780]   So when we don't understand the doctrine of the church, we can focus and be busy on evangelism,
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:32.660]   on fellowship, on discipleship, and focus on all of these things, and miss the big picture.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:39.420]   They're not recognizing that God's intent for the church is to build His church.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.660]   Why we do evangelism is for the building of the church.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:49.740]   Why God puts us in situations so that we can use our gifts to build the church.
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:54.780]   And if we don't understand the doctrine of ecclesiology about the church, and you don't
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:59.820]   see the big picture, we can be busy drawing rectangles and triangles, and that triangle
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.820]   looks great.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.860]   You know, some of you guys are focused on triangles, you know.
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.820]   It's about mercy ministry.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.220]   You know, we need to be merciful.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.220]   It's about the orphans.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.220]   It's about this, about this.
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.100]   And some of you guys are about evangelism.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.500]   No, it's about evangelism.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.500]   We need to share the gospel.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.500]   We need to do this.
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.100]   Some of you guys are on discipleship, you know.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.740]   So you got the rectangle, and it's like, it's a perfect rectangle.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.740]   Look at this rectangle.
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:21.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.660]   How come that square isn't shaped like me?
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.740]   And then the square is like, how come that triangle doesn't look like me?
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:29.780]   Right?
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.300]   Not realizing the big picture.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:37.740]   That in the context, when you read the scripture, all of these things put together build up
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.980]   the body of Christ.
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:47.980]   In Matthew 16, 17, this is the first place that Jesus uses the term "church," ecclesia.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.580]   And the word ecclesia literally means a gathering of called out people.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.700]   And it was used for two specific purposes.
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.140]   A gathering of military.
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.220]   Before they go to war, they would gather together, have a rally, and say, "Hey, we're going
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.740]   to go for this particular purpose."
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:08.060]   Or the word ecclesia was also used for the Senate Assembly.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:14.180]   People who were voted in for a meeting to help run the government.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.460]   So it wasn't just a random gathering of people.
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:21.440]   It was people who were selected in a gathering for a particular purpose.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.260]   And so when Jesus uses the term ecclesia, it was not a new term.
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.420]   Today if we say church, we automatically think of the Christian church.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:33.860]   But at that time, when they said ecclesia, they thought of the assembly.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:40.820]   A purposeful gathering of a small or gathering of elect people.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:41.820]   That's what the church is.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.820]   The church is a gathering.
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:49.540]   It is a physical gathering to represent the universal church.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:55.640]   In Matthew 16, 17, where Jesus uses that term first, he says, "Blessed are you, Simon,
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:00.400]   the son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:05.360]   And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.200]   gates of Hades will not overcome it."
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.120]   That God's intention was to build His church.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.300]   Not simply an individual.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.140]   Not simply somebody who can preach.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.860]   Not simply a place to preach the gospel.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:25.420]   But all of it collectively for the purpose of building His church.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:31.300]   And the only reason why you and I are here today is because God has covenanted with us
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.500]   to do that.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:41.440]   If you think about the 2,000 years of church history, the utter chaos, how often false
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.760]   doctrines have come in and done crazy things.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.220]   In the name of Jesus, they killed people.
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:50.740]   You know, I know, like right now, there's a lot of crazy things going on under the name
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.940]   of Allah and beheading people.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:57.880]   Well, Christians at some point in Christian history, they were killing other Christians
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.600]   because they didn't agree with them.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.940]   They burned people at the stake.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:06.720]   I mean, they – Christians, the church, did some crazy stuff.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.620]   We would look at all this, and how do we get here?
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.220]   At one point in church history, they were selling salvation.
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.300]   If you gave the church a lot of money, you know, they'd say, "You're blessed and
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.300]   you're saved.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:20.060]   Not only are you saved, but all your ancestors are saved."
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.300]   The only reason why you and I are here and the gospel is still being preached is because
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:29.100]   God made a unilateral covenant with us.
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:36.180]   He said, "I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.880]   We don't even have to look at church history.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.280]   Look at the people around us.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.660]   I know for a fact there's some people in this room thinking, "This church is going
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.540]   to die if this church is filled with those people."
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.420]   How is this church even functioning with those people?
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.100]   Let's get even closer, okay?
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.020]   We don't even have to think about other people.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.540]   Look at yourselves.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:05.460]   Look at – when I look at myself, how can God possibly think that this is a good idea?
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.140]   To entrust this message of salvation.
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:13.100]   He said, "You know, they will know you by the love that you practice with one another."
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.580]   And then we observe and observe ourselves, we observe the church, and it's like, "No,
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.140]   this church is going to die."
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.580]   How did we ever make it here?
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.660]   And how does God ever think that for the next hundred years the church is going to survive
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.580]   when we look at the condition of the church today?
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:38.300]   The only reason why you and I are here today is because God made a unilateral covenant.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.580]   And he said, "I will do it."
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.900]   You think about good marriages.
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.260]   I know, you know, I know there's some people that have been married for a long period of
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:51.500]   time and I feel like Esther and I, we have a great marriage.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:57.780]   You know, and some of you who are younger may think, "Oh, you found the right one."
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.780]   You know, and it was so perfect.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.260]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:06.700]   We fit, you know, she finished my sentences before, you know, like it cleared my throat
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:12.220]   and there's water on the table already, you know.
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:17.660]   A marriage is strong because there are times when it, you know, if I didn't want to be
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.700]   married with her, I wouldn't have asked her, right?
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:26.620]   But there have been times where we have persevered because of a covenant.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.820]   Because there was a covenant that kept us together.
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:33.500]   You know, I think about it, I'm like, "What the fuck?"
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.140]   Am I telling you something that is shocking to you?
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.740]   Any human relationship, there are periods of selfishness, there's periods of misunderstanding,
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.500]   there are periods when it's so difficult where you start to think, "I don't know, man, my
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.500]   life is miserable.
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.820]   She doesn't understand me, I don't understand her."
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:54.100]   But what keeps a good marriage growing and continuing is the covenant.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:30:00.340]   See, the only reason why you and I exist is because God made a unilateral covenant to
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.780]   build His church.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:11.540]   Despite our weaknesses, despite all the mess, despite all the divisions and all the things
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.780]   that we have seen, all the things that you see now, all the things that you experience
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.240]   from this point on.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.700]   Because God loves His church.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:24.820]   Ephesians 1, 22 to 23, it says, "God placed all things under His feet and appointed Him
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.660]   to be the head over everything for the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.580]   fills everything in every way."
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.740]   It is the body of Christ.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.660]   You know, I know some of you guys maybe here is thinking, "Well, you know, the body of
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.700]   Christ is a universal church."
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.860]   Everything that is written in the New Testament is written in the context of a local church,
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.580]   a local gathering.
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:51.300]   That's the term, ecclesia, is a gathering, a local gathering of people who've been called
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.200]   out for a specific purpose.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.700]   So when we talk about the church, we're not referring to the universal church, that's
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:30:59.700]   assumed.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:04.420]   But we're talking about the expression of that universal church in the local church.
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:10.060]   And He says, "It's that local church which is the body of Christ, and it is that body
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:15.660]   of Christ, us, is the fullness of Him who fills everything in every way."
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:23.260]   Again, you and I, because of the internet, that there is more and more people thinking,
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.220]   "Well, I mean, church is the sermon.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.780]   So if I go and listen to a sermon, I participated in the church."
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.180]   That's not what the scripture says.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:37.920]   It is the local gathering of believers where the fullness of Him who fills everything in
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   every way.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:43.500]   You did not attend service because you listened to a sermon on that Sunday.
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.460]   It is the local gathering of people.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:52.260]   You know the passage in Ephesians 5, 25-33, you hear that passage often in sermons at
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.260]   weddings.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:57.580]   And it's a beautiful description of a relationship between husband and wife.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.060]   And let me read you part of it.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:03.240]   It says, "Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.240]   for her."
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.340]   And again, you'll hear that in saying, "Hey, husband, love her unconditionally."
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:11.940]   You know, "To make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the Word,
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:16.780]   and to present her to Himself as the radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.660]   blemish, but holy and blameless."
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:24.220]   It's a beautiful picture of a husband that commits to his wife unconditionally as Christ
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.220]   did to the church.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:33.180]   And then it says to the wife, "In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.180]   their own bodies.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.940]   He who loves his wife loves himself.
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.980]   After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.340]   does the church, for we are the members of his body."
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.140]   But here's the catch.
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:49.340]   After he presents this beautiful picture of husband and wife and God-ordained relationship,
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:56.920]   he says in verse 32, "This is a profound mystery, but I am talking about Christ and the church."
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:03.740]   He wasn't using Christ and the church as an example to look at and say, "Look at the beauty
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.260]   of the relationship between husband and wife."
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:11.920]   He was referring to the relationship between husband and wife as an example of the beauty
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:16.420]   of Christ and the church.
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.500]   Now why is this important?
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:24.540]   One, we see the love that Jesus has for His church.
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.380]   Even with all the blemishes.
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.980]   In you and in me, He still loves the church.
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.140]   Now, that's one thing.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:39.380]   Like, even after I became a Christian, I mean, I can honestly confess to you, I loved God.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.100]   I even loved strangers.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:45.540]   Because as I'm praying for salvation, like God would give me a heart and I'd be broken
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:49.060]   for, whether it was the homeless people or people who just didn't know Christ.
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:53.340]   Even as I'm driving on the freeway, I look at the people on the freeway and God would
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.540]   give me compassion for them.
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.260]   So I'd be praying for them.
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:01.220]   But I can honestly tell you, I had no love for the church.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.420]   Because to me, church is where chaos happens.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.980]   Church is where hypocrites gather.
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:12.300]   Church is where people who, for whatever the reason, is using their flesh to kind of work
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.100]   up the ladder in the name of Jesus.
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.260]   And it was ugly to me.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.300]   And I wanted to commit to everything but the church.
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:25.060]   But what transformed my thinking was as I was looking at the scripture and found how
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.860]   much Jesus loved the church.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.180]   He died for the church.
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:34.440]   He demonstrated His love while they were sinners.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.300]   He loved the church.
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:41.740]   And I realized that I cannot love this God who loves this church so much and ignore what
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.940]   He loves.
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.460]   Who am I to come before God and say, "God, you messed up.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.900]   I know that that's what you're planning.
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:52.260]   We tried it for 2,000 years and it's not working."
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.620]   Who am I to come before God and question His judgment?
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.380]   And I realized that I need to commit to what He's committed to.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.780]   And that's what changed my paradigm.
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.980]   He loves the church.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.580]   That's why He calls us to love the church.
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.920]   Not because it's lovely.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.580]   He didn't love us because we were lovely.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.140]   He didn't love us because we had potential.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:21.300]   He loved us because He made a covenant with us that I will love you despite.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.940]   I will persevere with you despite.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:30.100]   I will cause this church to prevail despite.
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:34.140]   So who am I to come before God and say, "No.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.740]   Here my Lord sent me, but not to the church.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:38.860]   I want to go on missions.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.540]   I want to go on campus.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.700]   I want to do disciple making, but not to the church.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:47.180]   It doesn't work in the church."
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:53.980]   And I, honest with you, there are days that in my heart I kick and scream because sometimes
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:59.860]   I notice certain things and it triggers memories and I think to myself, "I don't know if I
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.380]   want to do this."
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:06.500]   And it's all that baggage from when I was a kid and I projected upon the church and
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:12.140]   I have to take a step back and revisit, "Who am I?
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:18.140]   Who am I to question if He loves the church for me to not to love the church?"
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:22.540]   See Colossians 118, it says, "He is the head of the body, the church.
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:26.820]   He is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead so that in everything He might
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.660]   have supremacy."
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.820]   What makes the church beautiful is not you, it's not me.
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.820]   It's Christ.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:41.580]   You know, those of you who are married and you've been proposed to, you know, you, I
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.900]   know not everybody, you know, got a diamond ring.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.460]   My wife didn't get a diamond ring either, you know.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:53.180]   But those of you who got a ring, when you get the ring, the focal point of the ring
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:58.540]   is the stone, whether it's diamond or opal, beautiful opal, right?
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.940]   Whatever it was, right?
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:05.100]   The focal point of all of that, the setting, is to highlight the stone.
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.620]   I just call it diamond, okay?
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.900]   I just call it diamond for the purpose of illustration, okay?
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.460]   The focal point of that ring is the diamond, not the setting.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.100]   The setting is only there to beautify the stone.
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:23.540]   But imagine if you got it, if you got the ring, and there's no focal point.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.540]   There's no stone.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.780]   All you have is the setting.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.980]   How many of you look at that, it's like, "That's an awesome ring," right?
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:34.500]   And there's a place for it, there's a little thing that holds up like this, but there's
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.500]   nothing there, right?
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.500]   How many of you are going to look at that ring, it's like, "That's a beautiful ring,"
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.500]   right?
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:44.380]   You're going to all look at that and say, "Where is this?
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.380]   What is this?"
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.380]   Right?
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:54.100]   Because the point of the ring that is the setting is to highlight the stone.
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:57.900]   And the better job it highlights the stone, the better job the setting does.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:03.780]   See, the scripture says the church is the setting for Christ.
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:09.820]   And our job is to be a setting so that Christ may be highlighted.
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:14.820]   And the moment where Christ is not the head, and He's not the purpose, and He's not the
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:19.480]   reason, then the church begins to look ugly.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.060]   There's something missing in this church.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:25.020]   You have great friendship, you know, people love each other.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.380]   I mean, you have a lot of money, you have, I mean, people are so nice.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:32.740]   But if Christ is not the focal point, if Christ is not the reason why you're coming, sooner
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:37.860]   or later you will see the blemishes, and that's all you will see.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:42.620]   You will see the ugliness, you will see the insecurities, you will see the cliquishness
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:46.860]   in the church, and that's all you will see.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.060]   What causes us to persevere?
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.000]   It's the stone.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.700]   It's the cornerstone that the world looked at and said, "This is worth it, let's throw
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:57.700]   it away."
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:04.500]   But you and I know that that's the chief cornerstone that keeps up this church.
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:08.260]   That you and I are dependent upon this cornerstone.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:13.140]   And so what causes us to persevere through the ugliness, through the mess?
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:17.020]   It's the beauty of the stone.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.380]   What causes you and I to persevere when we see ugliness in us?
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.020]   Is it because we're better than other people?
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:26.580]   We're more strong-willed and disciplined than other people?
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:31.900]   No, because Christ is beautiful.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:38.660]   And despite all my sins, despite all of your sins, Christ continues to call you and me
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.920]   to himself.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:47.380]   And that's why he says, "If the church does not lift up Christ, if the reason why you
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:54.100]   come to church is not Christ, if the reason why you love the church is not Christ, eventually
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.100]   it'll become an ugly place."
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.740]   You have four selfish people together, it's difficult.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:04.780]   You have a hundred people who are selfish together, it's impossible.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:13.660]   You have 400 selfish people looking for a place to feel significant, it will be a horrible
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.660]   place.
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:21.420]   And that's why he says, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 2, "For I decided to know nothing among you
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.700]   except Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:27.140]   Why did he say that?
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:32.380]   Because the only thing beautiful, worth upholding is Jesus.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:33.380]   That's why he said that.
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:38.660]   "I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ."
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.860]   I wanted to point you to Christ.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.100]   I want you to think about Christ.
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.820]   I want you to be gathered around Christ.
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.100]   And I'm going to preach Christ, I'm going to talk about Christ, and I'm going to love
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.220]   Christ, and I'm going to proclaim Christ, and I'm going to magnify Christ, because there's
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:41:00.420]   nothing else in the church that belongs on that pedestal but Christ.
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:04.380]   That's what the church is about.
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.720]   That's why we are sanctified.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.960]   You and I learn how to be patient with one another so that we can be a better setting
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.380]   for Christ.
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:17.780]   We learn how to be hospitable so that we can be a better setting for the stone, the chief
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:20.300]   cornerstone.
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:25.040]   You know, when I was younger in college, we lived, a lot of you guys know, I was in this
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:29.740]   intense apartment training, woke up in the morning, disciplined, evangelizing.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.980]   And so I really appreciated that.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:38.040]   But after about a year of living, I realized the real training wasn't the physical discipline.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:43.940]   Even though that was beneficial, the real training was happening in my heart.
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:49.340]   The bitterness I had toward my roommates, because they ate all the curry, you know what
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.340]   I mean?
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.460]   We made a whole batch of curry on Friday night, went to a leaders meeting Saturday morning,
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.260]   came back at 11 o'clock and it was all gone.
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.260]   And that bitterness, you know what I mean?
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.860]   It's like, this guy's so selfish.
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.260]   That guy always eats, but he never does his dishes.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.260]   Never!
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:09.660]   I've never seen him one time do his dishes.
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.860]   We're all sleeping at 11 o'clock, but this guy's playing guitar to throw in the morning.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:13.860]   He just does not care.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.860]   This guy's so selfish!
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.420]   You know what I mean?
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.700]   This guy always pays his rent late!
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.060]   Because of him, we always have to pay penalty.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.660]   I never want to live with a guy like that!
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:26.660]   Right?
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:31.740]   And all these things are building up inside, and at the end of the year, it's just like,
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:35.860]   I love Jesus, but this guy I hate, you know?
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:41.260]   I realized at the end of the year, the real sanctification, the real discipleship was
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:48.820]   happening within me, to confess my sins, my pride, to love my roommates that were difficult
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.400]   to love, you know?
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:58.100]   And so God was forming the person in me, even though I was focused on what was outside.
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.580]   And so all of that for what?
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.580]   You know?
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.460]   So if you're in the habit of coming in and saying, "Ha, these people, I rubbed these
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.740]   people wrong, and these guys are jerks, and that guy's insensitive," and then so you
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:12.180]   kind of pull back, you will never be sanctified.
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:17.340]   Because what God is really doing is in your own heart, your own pride, right?
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:21.940]   Your own insecurities, your own insurance, right?
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.380]   Where you find safety, where you find comfort.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:29.420]   God is challenging all of that to make sure that Christ is at the center, not you, not
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:35.220]   family, not possessions, not your job, not this world, not your health, that He'll tap
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:44.340]   into all of that to make sure that the setting, that place where at the center, that only
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:47.340]   Christ is there.
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:51.460]   That's why if you look at the qualification of an elder, it is not his gifting.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:55.300]   It's not like, you know, we would think if somebody's going to be preaching on a regular
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:44:01.340]   basis, the top quality, you would say that he needs to be at least articulate.
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.540]   He needs to enjoy reading.
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.260]   He's good at communicating.
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.060]   He needs to be somebody who can engage people.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:12.020]   He needs to be somebody who recognizes that people are not interested in the sermon and
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.900]   wrap it up, right?
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:17.180]   You have all these qualifications of what an elder should be, but if you look at the
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:23.000]   qualification of an elder, it's all patience, temperance, hospitality.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.140]   It's all character.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:29.580]   And all of these characters are things that happen in the context of a community.
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.580]   How do you know if you're a patient person?
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:36.220]   You just walk out and say, "I'm so patient."
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:38.740]   Do you know you're patient if you're in the middle of the mountain with nobody around
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:39.740]   you?
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.420]   Do you know if you're impatient?
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:42.420]   No.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:44.940]   How do you know if you're hospitable?
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.900]   I'm so hospitable, you just don't know.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.060]   You know, how do you know?
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:54.940]   Just know, right here, Holy Spirit told me, right?
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:56.500]   How do you know you're hospitable?
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.980]   In the context of the community that you belong to.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:01.960]   How do you know if you're a forgiving person?
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.820]   If you always run away from people that are difficult.
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:10.180]   All of these things God is sanctifying in the context of the community.
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:14.060]   So God is not simply bringing us together and saying, "Hey, you know, all the perfect
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:18.460]   people go to this church so that we can build up the body of Christ and do it."
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.020]   No, He brings us together.
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:24.780]   Part of it is to make a setting for Christ.
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:30.020]   We're in the context of building, rubbing each other, wrong sometimes.
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:35.860]   Different personalities, different backgrounds, different anxieties, different sins.
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:39.060]   And in that context, we learn to be patient with one another.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.180]   To be gentle, to carry each other's burdens.
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.820]   To be hospitable.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:50.060]   And as we are being sanctified, we make a greater setting for Christ.
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:54.820]   Isn't that exactly what Paul says in Timothy, 1 Timothy 3.14?
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.820]   I hope to come to you soon.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.980]   I am writing you these instructions so that if I am delayed, you will know how you ought
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:04.220]   to conduct yourselves in the household of God, which is the church of the living God.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.660]   The pillar and foundation of the truth.
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:12.060]   The church is the pillar and the foundation of the truth.
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:13.060]   What's the truth?
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.580]   Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.340]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:22.420]   The church is the foundation in which we lift up Christ.
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.500]   Again Ephesians 3.10-11.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:30.220]   His intent was that now, through the church, not just an individual, not just one person,
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:34.620]   not just an evangelist, not just a missionary, but through the whole church, with all our
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.140]   blemishes, right?
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:43.280]   With all our anxieties, even with all our divisions, he said, "Through the church."
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:48.500]   He covenanted that through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:52.540]   to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms.
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.900]   Known to his eternal purpose.
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.500]   This was not plan B. This was plan A, from the beginning.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:04.540]   You know, there are times when I look at the church and, you know, I know some of you guys
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.700]   are like, "You just don't know.
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.300]   You don't know how messed up the church is."
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.540]   These people, trust me, I know.
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.780]   I probably know better than you.
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.540]   You know, you may think about it every once in a while.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.380]   I think about it every single day.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.940]   Because I'm the pastor.
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:17.940]   I hear it.
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:18.940]   I hear it.
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:19.940]   I get emails.
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.900]   I get, you know, if something's happening, it usually comes to my ear.
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:26.260]   So, some days, some weeks, it just kind of piles up and like, "Oh my gosh!
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.360]   There's no hope for tomorrow!"
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:32.100]   You know, and really, I've shared this with you before, but there's sometimes I feel like
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.100]   a schizophrenic.
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:37.780]   You know, I leave church like, "Oh God, thank you so much for this church."
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.780]   And then I get an email and I hear these things like, "Oh my God, I don't want to do this
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.780]   anymore."
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:42.780]   You know?
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:49.740]   And every time I take a step back, and again, with all the baggage that comes in, I forget
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:53.220]   my hope is not in me, and it's not in you.
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:56.660]   It's in Christ.
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:00.400]   It's because Jesus loved us.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.400]   He loved us.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.020]   He loved you.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:07.180]   I can't, if you ask me why, I can't tell you why.
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.100]   What is, man, that you are so mindful of us?
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.800]   Why do you care for these people who are so hard to move?
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.800]   Why do you care for me?
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.100]   I'm so stiff-necked.
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:20.500]   I, I, when I read, you know, when I first started reading about Israel, I would say,
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.340]   "Oh my God, what's wrong with these people?"
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:26.700]   Now when I read Israel, I'm like, "I could see myself doing that."
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:31.340]   You know, I went in the desert, I have all my kids, and they can't drink water.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:35.300]   I mean, think about it as a parent, you know, maybe as a single person, I don't know.
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:36.300]   Think about it as a parent.
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:41.020]   You've got three small kids, you're walking in the desert, and let alone milk, there's
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.860]   no water for them to drink.
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.780]   How many of you would think, "Why did we come out here?
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.460]   I can't even, I can't even give them water."
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:55.460]   At least over there, I mean, I was working my butt off, but I couldn't give my kids water.
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:49:00.180]   And I read the Israelites, and I can say, "I can see myself saying that."
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:05.020]   I can see myself, every time they fall apart, I can see myself, now that I, I feel like
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:10.740]   I know myself a little bit better, I can see myself in every sin that Israel commits.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:14.940]   I can see myself doing what Peter did.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:19.500]   And I could even see myself doing what Judas did.
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:24.460]   And despite all of that, we're here.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.780]   We're still here.
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:33.220]   After 2,000 years of mess, of all the things that you brought into this room, and if we
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:38.900]   were to expose all of that, and we could see it with our eyes, we would say, "Oh my gosh,
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:39.900]   this church is in trouble."
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:48.660]   And yet, despite all of that, He said, "I will build my church, and the gates of Hades
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:52.140]   will not prevail against it."
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:57.060]   I don't know why, but He chose to love us.
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:04.740]   So who am I to say, "No, Lord, if you love the church, then I will love the church."
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:11.740]   I pray, again, with all my heart, that our commitment, that we would see the big picture,
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:16.340]   and not just see the little triangles and little squares, that what God is trying to
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.380]   build, that we would also build as well.
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:24.380]   Let's pray.
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:31.840]   Gracious and loving Father, You are a merciful, merciful God.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.580]   Help us, Lord God.
