[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440]   What I'm going to do is read Philippians 3 starting from verse 7, okay?
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.360]   Just so that we review the previous passage and portion, and also because reading it in
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:25.300]   its kind of like broader context will help us get a better feel of the tone, okay?
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.960]   Because I realize sometimes, you know, when I read the passage, I've got this very kind
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.960]   of monotone voice.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.960]   It's all boring.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.480]   But, you know, you guys know this passage is so powerful, right?
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.920]   There's so much oomph behind it.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920]   So here I go.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.920]   I'm going to do my best, okay?
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.680]   Alright, starting from verse 7.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.440]   But whatever things were gained to me, those things I have counted as lost for the sake
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.000]   of Christ.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.240]   More than that, I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.440]   Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.980]   rubbish so that I may gain Christ and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.280]   of my own derived from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.680]   which comes from God on the basis of faith.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.120]   Not that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His suffering
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.320]   being conformed to His death, nor that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.640]   Not that I have already obtained it or have already become perfect, but I press on so
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.720]   that I may lay hold of that for which also I was hold of by Christ Jesus.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.740]   Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.480]   One thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.480]   press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.640]   Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude, and if anything you have
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.040]   a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.920]   However, let us keep living by that same standard to which we have attained.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.240]   Brethren, join in following my example and observe those who walk according to the pattern
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.720]   you have in us.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.600]   For many walk of whom I often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.380]   of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose God is their appetite, and whose glory
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.540]   is their shame, who set their minds on earthly things.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.180]   For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly await for a Savior, the Lord
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.880]   Jesus Christ, who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.400]   body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   to Himself.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.480]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.880]   Lord, we want to thank you, God, so much for the exhortation in your scripture, and we
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.600]   also hear just the encouragement that we find from God for people to have confidence in
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.000]   you, for us to have great trust in your power, and just to know, Father God, that you have
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.640]   caused us to be something entirely different than we were before.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.920]   God, we want to thank you and pray that knowing these things would not be intellectual truths,
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.920]   but rather, God, that they would be things that we carry both in our minds and in our
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.280]   hearts, affecting, Father God, even our attitudes, affecting our decisions in every way that
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.760]   we respond to this life.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.440]   God, we want to thank you for this study, and pray, God, that you'd be with us.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.960]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:54.840]   Okay, so I wanted to give some various introductory remarks, okay?
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.080]   And number one is that this is a very strong exhortation to follow His example, and part
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.400]   of the reason why I read the whole section was because the whole tone just before was
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   like I press on, right?
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.560]   I lay aside everything, forgetting what is behind.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.880]   I'm straining towards the upward call that He's given me, and then He says, "Follow
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.880]   me," right?
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.520]   So to say that this is a strong exhortation is kind of an understatement.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.600]   I mean, man, if there was ever kind of an epic speech, so to speak, right?
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.760]   If there was ever a coach's like monologue, this would be one of those, yeah?
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.840]   This would be one of those moments, and what He gives is this strong, strong exhortation
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.760]   for everything that He's set up in terms of His mentality, everything that He's set up
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.560]   in terms of His perspective on life, the faith that He practices, and He says, "Join me,"
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.560]   right?
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.160]   So there's a huge exhortational flavor to this entire passage.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.680]   What's more, what I wanted to say is in verse 17 to 21, I'm sure one of the things that
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.880]   you guys saw was a massive comparison, right?
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.360]   Kind of literary structure is that He was comparing, and then in His comparison, there
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.400]   are the enemies of the cross, and He lists one, two, three, four, five different things.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.880]   And then He says, "But for us," and then He lists, "Da, da, da, da, da, these are true
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.320]   for us," right?
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.400]   And so whenever you do that, it's a great moment in your Bible study to say, "Okay,
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   I need to understand this comparison in its whole, and then what is the thrust of that
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.680]   comparison to me?"
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.200]   If He's going to give this comparison, there's also a point to be made.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   "See?
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.200]   You see this?
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   You see this?"
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.120]   And so that's one of the introductory comments that I wanted to make.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.400]   But one of the connection of that is if you review verses 1 through 16, that comparison
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.120]   has already been going on, right?
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.840]   Even in the previous section, even before that.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.320]   But again, the literary structure-wise, there was a big comparison and contrast between
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.320]   concepts.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.720]   Okay, what I'd like to do is give you a basic outline of the way that I divided up this
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   section.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.680]   And the way I did it was verse 17 was clear, a very obvious commandment to follow and observe,
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.680]   okay?
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.400]   And then in verse 19 are the warnings about the enemies, and then in verse 20 and 21 is
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.120]   the contrast about us as citizens, okay, us as citizens.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.880]   So that's just a brief outline that I've created there for you guys.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.560]   Let's jump into that first section then, the command to follow, okay?
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.680]   Because we had a nice short section this round, notice how I took some extra time to divide
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.080]   up even word by word, okay?
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.280]   And what I have here is He has the address brethren, which is just a sweet, again, He's
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.240]   kind of mentioned it multiple times to them, He called them brethren multiple times.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.800]   But the commands are very clear, there's two there, join in following my example and observe
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.000]   those, right?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.560]   Now what I'm going to say to you is I believe both are very important, okay?
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.920]   I believe both are very important.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:15.400]   But first, let's talk a little bit about how He is calling them to join in following His
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   example.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.880]   And what's really interesting is in many other areas of the Scriptures, Paul has exhorted
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.000]   the church to imitate him, okay?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.800]   I want to give you a couple of these passages.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.560]   For example, in 1 Corinthians chapter 4, he says this, "I exhort you, be imitators of
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.560]   me.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.240]   For this reason, I send to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord,
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.760]   and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.760]   church."
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:53.040]   Now what's really interesting then is Apostle Paul had a pattern church to church.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.120]   Here to the church in Corinth, and again, what we're studying in here in the book of
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.760]   Philippians, he has taught the Scriptures day in, day out.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.960]   He has then modeled and said, "Follow me," and then he even sent other individuals to
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.480]   make sure that they're following through in the instruction.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.800]   Here's another passage for you, 2 Thessalonians 3.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.760]   "For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we did not act
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.120]   in an undisciplined manner among you, nor do we eat anyone's bread without paying for
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.560]   it, but with labor and hardship we kept working night and day so that we would not be a burden
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.560]   to any of you."
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.960]   So not only just the spiritual sacrifice of teaching gospel, Apostle Paul exemplified
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.960]   work ethic.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.600]   Verse 9, "Not because we do not have the right to do this, but in order to offer ourselves
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.920]   as a model for you so that you would follow our example."
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.200]   Here's another passage, 1 Peter 5.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.080]   "Therefore, I exhort the elders among you as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.760]   of Christ and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, shepherd the flock
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.560]   of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily according
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.840]   to the will of God and not for sore gain, but with eagerness, nor yet as lording it
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:16.720]   over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock."
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.400]   Proving to be examples to the flock.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:25.160]   I just want to make a quick side comment there, which is, you know, whenever like I think
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   about, oh yeah, you know, placing people in leadership, or whenever I think about even
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.560]   the general topic of leadership, there's a lot to say.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.440]   I sometimes read articles that say, you know what leadership is?
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.440]   It's influence.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:44.440]   When you can speak, vision cast, let people see, all that kind of stuff, okay.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.720]   You know what leadership is?
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.960]   It's that kind of drive.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:52.160]   It's when you just keep going, like people have so many different definitions of leadership.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.400]   Well here's one that is very clear from the Bible, right?
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:05.960]   When an individual can model a pattern of faith, when an individual is exemplary, when
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:11.840]   an individual is already shown to look at the scriptures and apply, and they are setting
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.960]   forth then a kind of standard for Christian behavior, because what they're doing is they're
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.760]   following the Lord's instructions.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.320]   That's a pretty simple definition of leadership, right?
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.240]   And then here's my very, very free dating advice.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.560]   A lot of times I get dating like questions about, you know, should I make a decision
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.640]   based on potential?
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.920]   Like that guy has a potential to be a decent leader.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.920]   And I say, well, what did you see?
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.720]   What do you mean what did you see?
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:48.680]   Listen, I got to see actual exemplary in action kind of behavior where I can say, oh, I already
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.680]   see a pattern of obedience.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.400]   I already see a pattern of care.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:59.120]   I already see a pattern of being considerate, a pattern of consistency, and a pattern of
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.200]   devotion to Christ.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:08.080]   If everything is potential and not yet a pattern, then all we're going to say is, hmm, right?
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.000]   There's my free dating advice to you guys, okay?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.320]   All we're saying here is this.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.680]   Apostle Paul sets forth a very interesting exhortation to follow his example, but in
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.280]   him doing that, he says, you've already seen the pattern, right?
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.000]   He's already modeled.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.560]   Now what's really interesting is I asked you guys in your Bible study questions to take
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.600]   a moment to just kind of deeply meditate about that.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.760]   Because if you are thinking about it, then immediately you should be thinking like, whoa,
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.280]   right?
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:47.280]   Because this whole time remembering like Apostle Paul is saying, I am willing to count everything
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:54.480]   as loss, as a matter of fact, I've already experienced the loss of X, Y, and Z for the
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.720]   sake of Christ.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:02.960]   I want to so in such a devoted fashion pursue after Christ, I will forsake every earthly
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.720]   comfort.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.760]   And then when he says, join me, immediately I'm thinking, but I don't want to be in jail,
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.760]   right?
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.800]   Like, I don't want to go where you are.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.880]   That's why I asked the question, like if you just meditate upon that what Apostle Paul
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.720]   is saying, that is a incredibly high calling.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:28.640]   And there should be immediately in us kind of like, wow, am I willing to follow both
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.360]   the perspective, the willingness, the hard attitude?
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:37.640]   Am I willing to follow in the pattern that these apostles and the early saints have laid
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.640]   for us?
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.880]   That is actually a pretty incredible calling for us.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:48.640]   And by way of review, by way of review, we remember the calling of following example
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.720]   is not just, I want you to be gung-ho Christians that are radical.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.720]   Get out there and sell all your stuff, right?
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.240]   Like that wasn't actually his call here.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:05.680]   Because in the immediate context, the whole attitude was really at the core of what he
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.440]   was talking about, right?
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:13.000]   And so by way of review, we read it, but remember that it embodies everything from the attitude
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.320]   of valuing Christ, spiritually being able to see that Jesus is worth it all.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.200]   That's one of the first things we should embody or model after, right?
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.760]   That we should follow.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:31.200]   The desire, the desire to seek righteousness by faith and not of your flesh, to seek righteousness
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:37.240]   in the person of Christ and not just because you have accomplished something in your life,
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:43.360]   to be willing to take certain experiences of your life of suffering and persecution
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:49.380]   and respond in godliness and joy, model after that, right?
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:56.240]   So again, this exhortation to model and follow after his example is so big and I think we
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.520]   should really, really meditate on that.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.880]   Now one of the interesting things I kind of posed to you guys was, should we ever say
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.440]   that?
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.120]   Some of you guys are small group, every table has a small group leader.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.320]   Should you look at your table and say, "You follow me."
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.840]   Do what I say, right?
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.800]   Now the thing about it is some of you guys are like, "Oh, of course.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.400]   All I'm saying is if I'm studying, then you study.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.720]   If I'm like really serving, you serve."
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.280]   That's all I'm saying, right?
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.760]   But I think some people in knee-jerk reaction have like an issue with that.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.520]   It's like, "Isn't that kind of prideful, arrogant?
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.520]   How could we ever say that?
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.080]   We're like imperfect examples."
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.520]   As a matter of fact, I mean, if I put metrics on your performance and I started to survey
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.360]   people and I started to see, right, like exactly what you do in a given month, how many times
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.960]   did you sin, how many times did you not uphold a good example?
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   I mean, imagine if I did that and then I said, "Follow him," right?
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.180]   That'd be kind of weird.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.200]   Now one of the things I wanted to highlight to you is very interestingly, I don't think
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   Apostle Paul is saying, "You better listen to what I say because I'm the apostle," right?
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:14.520]   Now his apostleship comes with a lot of authority, but you know that this is no arrogant vibe
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.480]   for you better follow me, right?
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:26.880]   This is more so Apostle Paul's desire, "You should observe and see the Christ-like pattern.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.120]   You should observe and see the pattern that we've set for you."
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.200]   So he's not more so pointing the finger at himself.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.600]   What is he pointing the finger at?
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:41.720]   The belief, the faith, the principles of the Christian faith that we live by, right?
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:47.520]   Likewise for every single one of you, may I say all of you are older brothers and sisters
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.400]   to someone younger.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.960]   All of you have a great potential to guide and direct.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:16:00.760]   You are going to be what God uses to edify and teach and lay the example.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.320]   Don't be so afraid.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.880]   Don't be so afraid like, "I'm an imperfect person."
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.560]   Yeah, there's something to be said about that, sure.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.320]   But know that even the way that you react to your own imperfections, the way that you
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.560]   react to your fatigue, the way that you react to your struggle and frustration, "How come
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.560]   I'm not growing as fast as I would like to?"
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:27.640]   How you react to you having setbacks and major moments of suffering in your life.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.920]   Please understand that you are setting a pattern, right?
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.920]   We're all setting a pattern.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.200]   The Apostle Paul is pointing to that pattern.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.360]   His, you know, confidants and fellow laborers are setting a pattern.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.640]   And you know that we too are setting a pattern as well.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.640]   Okay.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:53.720]   So that being said, let's move on to section two.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.720]   Verse 18 through 19.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.720]   In section two is the warning about the enemies of the cross.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.720]   Okay.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.480]   The warnings about the enemies of the cross.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:10.440]   It says here, "For many walk, of whom I often told you."
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.440]   Oh, whoa.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.920]   What happened here?
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:19.200]   "And now tell you even weeping that they are enemies of the cross, whose end is destruction,
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:24.960]   whose God is their appetite, whose glory is in their shame, and who set their minds on
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960]   earthly things."
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.960]   Okay.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:32.040]   I want to highlight a few observations for you guys and ask this question, right?
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.560]   It's very interesting that he kind of, I put it in parentheses because he's saying like,
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.160]   "Okay, there's many who walk."
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.640]   The many, he already is thinking about those enemies, right?
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:47.840]   But then he says like, "And I already told you a bunch of times and I'm telling you crying."
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.360]   Now that's pretty intense.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.800]   So we have to ask the question, why is he so intense?
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:18:01.160]   What's causing him to have this weeping emotion and this kind of urgency where it's frequent,
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.600]   it's like ongoing, right?
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.560]   Now there are a lot of things.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:10.160]   I don't want to necessarily spend too much time on it, but there are a lot of things
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.440]   we can say, but this is one thing that I think, I think may answer that question.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.080]   Why is he weeping?
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.080]   Well, because one of the things is very clearly in the book of Philippians, a group of people
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:27.240]   that he had this frustration and yet very interesting kind of emotional reaction to
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.360]   were the Jews.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.500]   The people who took confidence in the flesh, right?
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:38.200]   The people who took confidence in their rituals, the people who took confidence in Sabbath
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.220]   and all sorts of, all those kinds of things.
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.680]   And what's really interesting is his general perspective towards them is revealed in Romans
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.680]   chapter nine.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.040]   He says, "I'm telling the truth in Christ.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.280]   I'm not lying.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:55.880]   My conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit that I have great sorrow and unceasing
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.920]   grief in my heart, for I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.840]   for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh."
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.560]   Wow.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:13.740]   That's pretty incredible stuff to say he has this unceasing grief in his heart.
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:19.520]   Could it be that he has such polar opposite emotions to one people?
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.840]   And the answer is yes.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:27.260]   Very clearly because of their false doctrine, because they constantly try to attack and
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:32.000]   persecute the church, he's got this frustration and anger and he tells it like it is, "You're
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.680]   enemies of the cross," right?
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.920]   But on the flip side, there is this deep anguish.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.840]   "Oh, but I wish that they would be saved," right?
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.200]   Now other commentators have said, "Well, here is another thought.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.360]   What's really interesting is he is talking to the church and very clearly the church
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:58.240]   people know who he's talking about because he's mentioned them frequently.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.840]   He warned about them multiple times."
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:06.440]   And so some commentators wonder, they just pose this thought, "Could it be that like
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:12.920]   many other churches, there are people who initially were close, perhaps they were involved
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.760]   in the building of the church initially, perhaps they were part of the action and part of the
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:23.760]   life of the participants of the life of the church and yet only later revealed themselves
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:29.680]   to be distant, to be false gospel preachers or just individuals in the church who are
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.160]   false?"
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.800]   Scripture does warn us many times.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.840]   For example, 2 Corinthians 11 verse 12 to 15, "What I am doing I will continue to do
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:44.720]   so that I may cut off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded as
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.460]   just as we are in the matter about which they are boasting.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:53.120]   For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.120]   of Christ.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.280]   No wonder for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:04.280]   Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness,
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.560]   whose end will be according to their deeds."
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.200]   It's pretty similar, right?
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.920]   Really similar.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.840]   Talking about their end, their nature, their character.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:24.600]   All I want to do is take a moment to speak about this and say, "Man, it is such a grieving
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.440]   thing, right?"
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.800]   When Apostle Paul is pointing out enemies of the cross, that is a really emphatic statement
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.320]   and it is a statement of judgment to be an enemy of the cross.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.080]   But it's very interesting his attitude, right?
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.280]   It's not like, "That's right!
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.640]   I knew he was a heretic!
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.600]   I knew all along!"
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:51.440]   And if it ever so happens, because I'm guessing that even at a church where I feel like, "Man,
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.480]   we try to get to know every person who's becoming a member.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.480]   We interview them.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.560]   We try to fellowship."
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.560]   And could it be that there's a sad state of affairs where even after years, people leave
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.880]   the flock saying, "You know what?
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.880]   Forget about this faith, right?
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.280]   I don't believe that stuff."
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.880]   Of course that can happen.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.280]   Those are moments to grieve, yes?
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.240]   Those are not moments to be bombastic.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.120]   "I knew all along we should have kicked him out long time ago!"
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.120]   That's not the attitude, right?
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.560]   That we see here.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.120]   I just wanted to make a brief mention of that.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:32.320]   Now, here as we think about Apostle Paul's evaluation and judgment and the contrast and
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:37.400]   the comparisons, what I like to do sometimes when I study the Bible is if I start seeing
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.120]   a list, I like listing them all out this way.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.240]   And I just start numbering them.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:54.600]   And what's really interesting is, man, how intense that kind of evaluation is, right?
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.120]   If it just so happened that there were people in the church that, let's say, denied certain
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.120]   truths.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.000]   Let's say there were certain people in the church that denied the apostles' leadership,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.880]   whatever it may be, right?
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.560]   He calls them enemies of the cross.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.680]   And there's such a kind of polarizing effect on that then.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.120]   And all I want to say about that is, man, what you'll see is our enemy is going to use
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.680]   all sorts of different strategies.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.560]   Is there clear, just like head-on persecution from the enemies?
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.560]   Yes.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.760]   Does it always have to be head-on persecution?
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.920]   No.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.800]   As a matter of fact, we know that it's not going to be like burning crosses and burning
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.560]   churches and incarcerating Christians sometimes.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.760]   But rather, it's going to be falsehood.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.600]   It's going to be the falsehood of a flesh-based righteousness.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.120]   It's going to be the falsehood of like an intellectual-based righteousness.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.040]   You know, feeling safe because I know some facts.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.040]   I'm not involved.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.760]   I have no desire to grow, but because I know this stuff, I'm good.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.880]   Even that, even that can be very, very contrary to the cause of Christ.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.800]   A couple of these things I'm going to mention, and a couple of them, for the sake of time,
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.080]   I'm going to go through.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:11.600]   Remember here that Apostle Paul, it's very important that he's going to call every Christian
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:18.560]   to remember the path, the faith and destiny of the people who are enemies of the cross.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.000]   And he describes them, I'm going to move on to this next thing.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.600]   He describes them as those whose God is their appetite, whose glory is their shame, and
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.080]   who sets their minds on earthly things.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.160]   And for your discussion, I don't have the question in there, but you should describe
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:41.120]   like what are some kind of, you know, common tendencies, tail signs of people who are false
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.960]   Christians or people who are against the gospel.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.280]   Clearly we're supposed to be able to identify them.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.680]   Clearly we're supposed to be warned about them.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:58.240]   But again, I want to share with you guys this idea that Scripture calls us to keep our eyes
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.240]   open.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:04.920]   Romans chapter 16, verse 17 through 18 says this, "I urge you, brethren, keep your eye
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.480]   on those who cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learn and
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.880]   turn away from them.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:16.420]   For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ, but of their own appetites.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:22.000]   And by their smooth and flattering speech, they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting."
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.760]   What's very interesting is the description of the enemies of Christ, he describes as
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.160]   those who do not have a control of their desires.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.520]   Whatever it is, their impulse, they do.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.040]   Whatever it is they're set on, they're stubborn.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.760]   Whatever it is they latch onto, they feel like they have to have it, right?
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.200]   A kind of uncontrolled desire.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   And what's more, there is this flattering, deceptive speech that comes upon them.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.800]   Jude 4, "For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long beforehand
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.600]   marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:01.160]   licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ."
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.720]   One thing I want to share with you guys, over the years of doing ministry and talking to
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:11.000]   people, what I found is it just comes back to a simple thing.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.560]   Whatever teaching you hear, don't feel like you have to know every single fact, you have
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.080]   to go take courses on different cults and religions.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.600]   If you do, great, more power to you.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:26.520]   But what you'll find is whatever religion it is, it'll always make Jesus the person
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.520]   obsolete.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.320]   It'll establish human leaders, it'll establish, you know, if I just say this, I'm good.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.080]   It'll establish some kind of benchmark, if I just do this, I'm good.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.760]   But it'll always make Christ the person obsolete.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.440]   It'll neglect him, it'll diminish him.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.720]   Anything that takes away from the significance of the person of Jesus, not just like, "Oh,
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.920]   you know, I claimed his name and that's it."
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.760]   But we're talking about the need to abide in Christ, okay?
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.000]   All right.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   So in that section was the warnings about those who are enemies of the cross.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.080]   In the next section, then here now is the big contrast.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.000]   I asked you, "What is this flow of thought here?"
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.920]   And again, I wanted you to see that there is this big contrast.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.040]   Here and now, I kind of reflect on this, and I'm going to read it and say this.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.200]   "For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:28.040]   Jesus Christ, who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:34.600]   body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.800]   to Himself."
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.680]   The contrast.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:43.400]   For those who are enemies of the cross, you are going to quickly see that their worldview
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.400]   is this small.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.160]   Let me repeat that, okay?
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.280]   When you try to evaluate individuals who are like enemies of the cross or this categorically
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.600]   bad, you will realize that their worldview is this small.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.480]   And therefore, even small setbacks are huge.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.320]   Therefore, little offenses are not, "How dare you offend me?"
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.320]   Right?
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.360]   Everything is blown out of proportion in this life.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.360]   Why?
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.760]   That's all they have.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.280]   And so guess what?
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.200]   All the other things they value, the treasures of the world, it's huge.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.200]   Why?
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.480]   Because their world is small.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.900]   When your world is small and you have a house and you have your career and you have a mansion,
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.200]   you have your bank account, whatever it is, now all of a sudden, all those things have
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.840]   incredible value.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.840]   Why?
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.600]   Because to your small world, proportionately, it's massive.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   But when you have heaven, all of that becomes just a speck.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.360]   What Apostle Paul is doing is giving this contrast.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.640]   The enemies of the cross, all they have in their mind is the world.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:51.280]   I want you to have in your mind the kingdom.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.600]   Your citizenship is in heaven.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:59.680]   And from heaven, we eagerly await the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.680]   Okay?
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.480]   The Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:08.200]   Here there's so much to talk about this and I just want to present to you some questions
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.160]   for your discussion, okay?
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.160]   And then give you maybe like a more personal thought about this.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:22.000]   Man, I definitely want you guys to discuss how is this idea of citizenship, having a
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.200]   certain right and privilege in a kingdom supposed to affect us, right?
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.080]   And I'm just going to say, I mean, obviously there are various things that it should.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:37.040]   How were the people who were originally listening to this, how would they have received it?
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.720]   And I understand a lot of them took pride in their Roman and citizenship.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.880]   They understood the concept.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.900]   How does that impact them?
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:50.560]   And especially to a people who are being persecuted, in what way is it going to encourage them,
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.560]   right?
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.960]   Now, my personal reflection about this is this.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.640]   As I read this passage, there's so much to say.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.840]   I mean, I get it like this passage is supposed to wow me.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.520]   Do you feel like that?
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:07.720]   I mean, he's talking about your citizenship is in heaven, right?
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:12.280]   You belong there and your savior is going to come from there.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.560]   And I started like envisioning like the way I should feel is like if I'm in prison in
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:20.320]   like Afghanistan or something and my country, like the seals are going to come and get me,
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.320]   right?
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.720]   Like I should have that kind of like, yeah, don't worry, they're going to come.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.240]   They're going to rappel down the helicopter.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.040]   He's, you know, all that kind of stuff.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.960]   Now, what I realized was there's so much more to that.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.600]   This savior is going to come and he's going to transform the body of our humble state
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.000]   into conformity with the body of his glory.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.600]   So in your notes, I have these two major points.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   We should definitely understand what it means to have citizenship in heaven, how that's
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.440]   supposed to impact us.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.700]   But there is this forward looking hope.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.280]   God is going to transform me.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:59.720]   And what's crazy about it is if I was in the pit of hell because of my sins and I was
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:06.800]   destined to decay in eternal damnation and he raised me from that, wow.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   But then now he's saying he's going to conform me to the glorified body of Christ.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.360]   Like I'm not even sure what that looks like, right?
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.380]   I mean, that's wild.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:25.400]   He is going to transform me and perfect me in conformity to the perfections of Christ's
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.960]   body in his glory.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.360]   Think about that for a while.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:39.240]   This passage, if you just read it cursory, I mean, you should force yourself to stop
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.380]   and ask how is this supposed to affect me?
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:47.260]   Because I think there's a train of thought here.
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.540]   And I have this line for you.
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:53.940]   He says that whole transformation is going to be amazing, but it's going to be accomplished
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.900]   by the exertion of his power, right?
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.700]   The exertion of his power.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:05.060]   The power that Jesus has, the authority that Christ has, where he is going to command in
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:11.580]   the moment's notice and all the world is going to lay at his feet.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:17.100]   Whether Christian or non-Christian, even those who are going to be condemned to hell, they
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.860]   are going to recognize Jesus and fall.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:27.580]   That power that Jesus has, he's going to exert and he's going to change us.
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.580]   Think about that.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.740]   I mean, that's just beyond wow.
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.860]   It's like, oh my goodness, we can just dwell on that for hours.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:40.260]   And I want you to think, in the moments that the church is hearing this, I think there
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:45.100]   are times, there are in a time where they're going to feel powerless.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.620]   If you operate by your sight, they're going to feel like, oh my goodness, our beloved
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.380]   pastor is in prison.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.220]   There are these wicked guys constantly trying to preach to us.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:33:00.140]   There are people in our church who are jettisoning the faith and leaving.
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.700]   My own property is getting confiscated.
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.540]   We are very, very unsure about the government, if they're going to hate us, if they're going
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.020]   to give us our privileges or not.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.460]   What in the world is happening?
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:17.500]   And I feel like Apostle Paul is saying, look, do you see the power that your Savior is going
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.220]   to exert?
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.500]   Do you have this hope?
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.740]   And what I have for you in your notes is there is this amazing paradox that every Christian
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.740]   is supposed to live under.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:35.180]   You are supposed to have this reality that you see, you see in better eyes, the kind
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:40.280]   of depravity that exists in this world, right?
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:45.580]   You are supposed to see with better eyes the kind of finality of death that's coming.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:50.900]   You're supposed to see with better eyes the reality that this world is doomed.
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:59.540]   You know because God has told you, this earth cries out in groaning and everybody stands
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:03.380]   in an ominous position under God, right?
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:08.180]   But the paradox is, the theme of this book, you're supposed to find joy.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:10.220]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:15.820]   Have you ever met somebody who is just this like happy-go-lucky person, just happy and
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.420]   giddy all the time?
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.660]   They have no reason to be, but they're just always like, "Ha ha, yeah, I'm good."
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:25.340]   You know like, and part of it is just like, that's so annoying, like it's irritating,
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.420]   right?
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.800]   Because you almost feel like, stop being fake.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.940]   You don't have to laugh like that all the time, you know?
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:38.140]   Now, you know that's just the judgmental side of me coming out, but the fact of the matter
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:46.900]   is actually when I see the world, the fallen world, try their best feeble attempt to find
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:51.900]   little joys and stuff, now that I've been, you know, now that we've been like digging
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:56.620]   into Scripture and I've been living the faith, I do get not just simply annoyed by that,
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.620]   I get sad.
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.540]   Like look at them.
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:06.540]   They're trying to grab onto little pieces of hope and in silver linings, little pieces
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.340]   of hope and like, it's in the small things, man.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:14.020]   Like you guys heard those cliche terms, right?
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:21.980]   Where for us, we have this incredible hope that the power of Christ is going to transform
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.660]   us, that there would be no sin in us.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:29.340]   There would be no more frustration of temptations and weakness.
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.820]   It's not so much that, "Oh, there's just not going to be any tears anymore."
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:36.340]   There's going to be no more sin.
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:40.780]   It's going to be the perfect presence of God and the perfect presence of Christ dwelling
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.580]   with us and we're going to be like Him.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.740]   What an amazing hope we have.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:53.660]   We have so much more than just lighthearted, giddy, pithy statements.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:59.260]   We have so much more than nice sunsets and trees.
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:05.860]   We're going to have the very presence of Christ exerting His power, conforming us to His image.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.300]   That should motivate us, right?
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:12.820]   When I said this was one epic speech, I really believe it.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:16.700]   I always try to like imagine it if I'm sitting there hearing it, right?
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.900]   And I hope you guys sense it too.
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:24.260]   For us, our greatest motivation lies nowhere in this world.
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:29.420]   It is absolutely in heaven and Scripture calls us that if we have been raised with Christ,
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:34.940]   we should keep seeking the things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:39.100]   Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth, for you have
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.140]   died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:49.380]   When Christ who is our life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:55.660]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:01.820]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much and pray, God, that you would grant to us deep
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:09.380]   conviction of your work, of your presence, and what's more, your plans for us for the
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.380]   future.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.380]   God, help us to know and believe that there is so much more than what we see with our
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.380]   human eyes.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:21.500]   God, I pray that we would not operate by sight, but Lord, that we would live life by
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.860]   faith.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:29.900]   All the things that we learn here, help it not to just pass by us as mystical and paradoxical
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:35.660]   statements, but God, I pray that you would cast for us a great vision of heaven.
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:40.220]   And Lord, that would motivate us, that will help us to persevere through every single
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:46.180]   hurdle, every single hardship, and whatever hurtment and pain may come our way, I pray,
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:50.260]   God, that we would exercise our trust in the power of Christ.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.300]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:38:01.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
