[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   like person, how people look imagery, right?
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.440]   So this one here, we see his body, his head,
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.640]   his face, and his legs.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.200]   It says that his body is clothed in a cloud, is wrapped.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.680]   He's shrouded in a cloud.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.180]   Now think about that.
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.180]   Think about the enormity of clouds.
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.320]   Clouds are huge.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.880]   And for someone to call that their jacket, this is a big,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.760]   big angel that we're looking at here.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.520]   It says that his head is wrapped with a rainbow.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.920]   And we saw a little bit about the rainbow in chapter four.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.600]   Behind the throne of God, that there
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.480]   was this rainbow showing.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.280]   I remember what the rainbow represents
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.960]   during the time of Noah, that in the midst of judgment that
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.280]   wiped out all of planet Earth, that the rainbow showed mercy.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.080]   It showed hope, that God will no longer--
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.600]   no more do what he did there.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.040]   And so it shows, even in this thing, that his head--
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.080]   and think about this.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.600]   Rainbows are huge, right?
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.640]   They stretch from one end to the other.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.320]   I don't know if you guys have ever tried to go
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.200]   to the end of a rainbow.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.640]   One time I did, when I was in elementary school,
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.080]   because somebody had said that at the end,
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.000]   you get a pot of gold.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.400]   And I actually believed it.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.320]   This was a real story where I believed it,
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.640]   because my friend had told me that the guy--
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.480]   you know the Lucky Charms dude?
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.520]   That guy, he said that at the end of the rainbow.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.480]   So I followed it.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.440]   And I ended up about 30 minutes away from home,
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.240]   because I was following a rainbow.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.880]   And it's big.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.920]   I was really, really far from home.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.340]   And to look at something like this,
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.320]   it's just that his head is wrapped in a rainbow.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.000]   Just imagine a head underneath that stretch of land
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.360]   that I covered.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.560]   It's trying to describe something about this angel.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.480]   It says his face is like the sun.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.040]   The sun.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.880]   You know how many Earths fit in the sun?
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.400]   This is a huge, huge face.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.080]   Not only that, I know you have been told.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.920]   Don't look at the sun.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.080]   You've been told that.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.760]   So what is this trying to describe?
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.480]   That there's this radiant glory coming out from this angel.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.320]   That this huge angel has the face of a sun.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.440]   And it's not just like a sun that Addie draws.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.880]   She likes drawing little suns and coloring it now
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.720]   and things like that.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.920]   It's not like, oh, that's a cute little sun.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.800]   This is the blazing sun.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.560]   This is the thing that will melt you.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.480]   And his face is like that.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.400]   And it says also that his legs were like pillars of fire.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.560]   You gotta imagine what fire is.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.000]   First of all, fire is judgment.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.280]   And you can see that in some of these different places.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.200]   I wrote here Isaiah 66, 16 just for one thing.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.600]   I don't even know if I wrote down those texts.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.600]   But fire is this idea of it burning through things.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.280]   And so imagine this ginormous angel
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.800]   with legs that are like pillars of fire.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.680]   And imagine him walking.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.080]   Imagine what it does.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.440]   And so here's this angel that's described
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.240]   from verse one all the way through verse two.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.720]   And it says that he had a little scroll
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.440]   open in his hand in verse two.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.200]   And they're trying to show kind of the disparity here
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.640]   between this huge angel and this tiny scroll in his hand.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.720]   And it says he set his right foot on the sea
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.480]   and his left foot on the land.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.560]   This is a huge angel.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.440]   And he called out with a loud voice like a lion roaring.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.600]   So if we wanna go through these bullet points,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.080]   if the description above isn't enough
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.400]   to show how massive this angel is,
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.200]   his feet being on the sea and land describes his enormity
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.120]   and his power over all the earth.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.600]   Next bullet point in verse two,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.880]   it is literally the scroll.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.680]   This little scroll that we're talking about
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.240]   is a scroll that says that which was opened.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.560]   It's in the perfect participle.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.240]   And this scroll that had already been opened,
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.920]   meaning it is to remain open.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.280]   Okay, so there is a time and point where it was opened
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.200]   and it was just, that is its characteristic.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.680]   This is an open scroll.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.280]   This is in stark contrast to the scroll
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.000]   that had the seven seals on it, right?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.960]   That one was sealed
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.920]   and it was desperately wanting to be opened.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.840]   This was a scroll that was open,
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.800]   meaning whatever message was in it
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.400]   had already been displayed to the world.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.240]   Okay, so that gives us a little bit of a clue
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.240]   about what might be written in it.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.760]   This scroll, it describes the remaining divine judgments.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:39.440]   And there's this idea of a completed gospel
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.440]   given to the world that says,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.040]   judgment is coming for you, so believe in Christ.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.480]   So it's the full gospel that we have.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.320]   And this scroll is opened up saying, it's going to come.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.920]   Everything has been revealed now.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.400]   Genesis to Revelation is going to be in your hands
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   after this vision.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:06.840]   And as this angel is holding this scroll,
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.400]   it says this in verse three,
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.080]   called out with a loud voice like a lion roaring.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.320]   And when he called out, the seventh thunder sounded.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.200]   And when the seventh thunder had sounded,
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.320]   I was about to write,
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.720]   but I heard a voice from heaven saying,
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.600]   seal up what the seventh thunders have said
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.840]   and do not write it down.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.840]   So the next, or next section here,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.280]   and number one, lion's roar, this is the Lord's voice.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.360]   The Lord's voice.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.640]   And the lion's roar, this voice of a lion is described
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.920]   a few times in the Old Testament.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.920]   In Hosea 11, verse 10, it says,
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.880]   they shall go after the Lord,
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.120]   and he will roar like a lion.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.160]   When he roars, his children shall come
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.560]   trembling from the west.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.760]   They shall come trembling like birds from Egypt,
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.880]   and like doves from the land of Assyria,
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.560]   and I will return them to their homes, declares the Lord.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.320]   Now don't think about, I think the only times
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.520]   we've seen lions are in like children's books
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.960]   or at a zoo or something like that, right?
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.200]   Now lions were a common wild animal during this time.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.440]   And so like if you go roaming out
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.240]   into the wilderness at night, what's gonna happen?
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.040]   A lion might come and eat you.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.200]   This was a real thing.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.880]   It's not a parent saying, don't go out
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.160]   because a boogeyman's gonna come and get you.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.840]   No, it's like, don't go out because remember,
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.520]   little Johnny got mauled by a lion.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.800]   You know, it's that kind of thing.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.360]   This is a scary thing.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.560]   This is not just like a lion roar.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.240]   It's not just like, oh yeah, like a ferocious,
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.560]   you know, Aslan, you know, that kind of thing.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.800]   It's even like Aslan, I think,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.280]   paints such a good picture of who God is.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.040]   And yet there's a ferocity in this.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.520]   And it says this also in Amos chapter three, verse eight.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   For the Lord God does nothing without revealing
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.920]   his secret to his servants, the prophets.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.760]   The lion has roared, who will not fear?
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.160]   The Lord God has spoken, who can but prophesy?
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.600]   I love that question, who will not fear?
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.080]   If we took not like a carnival, you know,
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.760]   what do you call those, the circus lions?
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.720]   Not those types of things where we go and like,
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.040]   you know, it's tamed and like,
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.880]   they'll put their head in those lion mouths
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.800]   and things like that.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.760]   But like, if we got one from the middle of the jungle
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.960]   and we placed this lion right here and it roared,
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.680]   every single one of us would tremble down to our shoes,
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.880]   right, we would be screaming and running as fast as,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.840]   we would be jumping over each other to get out of this place
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.520]   it would be so terrible, it's a thing of nightmares.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.840]   And so this voice sounds from this angel.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.080]   And though it is this angel speaking,
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.080]   this is the angel speaking on behalf of the Lord God.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.000]   And as if thunders weren't loud enough,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.360]   it says there are seven, it sounds like seven thunders.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.440]   This is a complete voice of God calling out to,
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.480]   and it's the next blank, judgment.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:17.080]   Like seven thunders, this complete completion
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.560]   of this sound that is coming out.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.080]   What's interesting about this text is that it says
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.280]   that the angel told him, even though John actually,
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.680]   those seven thunder voices were audible
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.280]   and he understood what it said
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.480]   and he was about to write it down,
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.040]   God says, don't write that one.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.320]   Now this is different.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.160]   He's not, I got a little confused
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.200]   the first time I had read this.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.560]   That little scroll, he's not called to,
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.040]   okay, here's the little scroll that's open
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.960]   and to write down what, he was about to write it there.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.800]   That's not what it was.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.600]   That little scroll already had things written in it.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.200]   Okay, remember that's the completed thing,
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.080]   that's the completed gospel that we have
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.560]   and the coming judgment that's gonna be
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.640]   complete.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.440]   This was a different thing and God says,
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.480]   don't write that.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.720]   He's instructed not to.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.200]   Now this is just a simple exercise
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.680]   just to kind of get us more interactive here.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.920]   Why do you think we aren't told what was spoken?
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.040]   Go ahead and turn to your neighbor
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.920]   and then try to make your best guesses
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.800]   because I know you could get anywhere with this one.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.280]   So think about this one.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.320]   So you could turn to your neighbor
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.680]   and kind of speculate together.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.600]   Here.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.440]   There.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.080]   There.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.240]   (tapping)
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.400]   (tapping)
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.120]   There's a little hint down there,
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.280]   it's a simple answer.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.320]   (laughing)
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.600]   So you don't have to think too hard about it.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:15.200]   Okay, anybody wanna volunteer what the other person said?
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.120]   Not what you said, what the other person said.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.480]   So volunteer.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.720]   (laughing)
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.760]   Matt, did you raise your hand right now?
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.960]   Matt Ting?
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.280]   Was that a hand?
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.480]   Oh, that was a fake out.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.720]   (laughing)
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.560]   Huh?
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.800]   Because we don't need to know it.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.640]   Okay, good.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.480]   There's the next bullet point.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.200]   This is different from the direction given to him
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.680]   in Revelation chapter one, verse 10 through 11 and 19.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.760]   And those are passages, if you look back there,
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.080]   where God says, "Write all these things down."
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.000]   Well, God says here, "Don't write this down."
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.840]   Why?
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.680]   Because there's no need,
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.480]   so there is no need to speculate
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.280]   as to what was spoken.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.640]   Now this is, we're not just doing this.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.040]   I'm not just yanking your chain or whatever.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.040]   As I was reading this, I'm like, "God, why would you do that?"
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.080]   You know, I'm kind of known as the person
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.520]   that's gonna be like, "Hey, hey, can I tell you something?"
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.560]   And then like, you know, people will be, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.440]   I'm like, "Oh, nevermind."
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.520]   You know, I'm that kind of guy.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.920]   And I won't say it because I'm like,
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.400]   "Oh, I shouldn't have even started that."
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.120]   But, and then people, "You can't do that."
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.920]   You know, I kind of felt that way with this.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.440]   Like, "God, what, what?
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.800]   "Seven thunders, what's it going to say?
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.560]   "Tell us what it's going to say."
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.240]   And he says, "Don't write it, John."
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.160]   I'm like, "No, why would you do that?
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.520]   "Why would you even tell us that?
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.160]   "If you didn't want John to write it, don't even say that."
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.240]   Well, there's a reason.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.560]   Because there's an application to this.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.840]   Sometimes we want to know everything.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.080]   Sometimes we want to know everything.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.960]   And we don't need to know everything.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:53.600]   For example, people, I think, can even discount the Bible
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.440]   because it doesn't answer everything.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.520]   And so, you know, that's why I don't like, like,
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.080]   free-for-all Q&As that are not done well
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.400]   because people are just going to come
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.120]   and try to, like, ask questions that are going to stump people.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.400]   And, you know, it's like, well, at the end of the day,
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.440]   no person is going to have all the answers to anything.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.600]   Right? Or everything.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.480]   And so, just because of that, people might have questions
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.880]   that they feel like aren't answered in the Bible.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.560]   So they say the Bible's not true.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.360]   God must then not be real.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.800]   Or the God of the Bible is either not a real God
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.120]   or He's a bad God that I'm not going to follow.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.280]   And that's a ridiculous line of thinking.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.920]   It says in Deuteronomy 29, 29,
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.040]   "The secret things belong to the Lord."
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.560]   That all, it's OK not to know.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.000]   We have everything that we need.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.160]   We don't need any more than what's been displayed to us
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.920]   and revealed to us in Scripture.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.440]   Everything we need that pertains to godliness is found here.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:03.280]   You know, Addie asks way too many questions.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.840]   Like, a lot.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.480]   Like, nonstop.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.400]   Like, sometimes it'll take us about 30 minutes to get home,
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.600]   and from start to end, she'll ask questions.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.720]   So much so that we have set, like, Alexa, you know,
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.280]   like, the dots, and we set it up at home
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.800]   so that every time she does that,
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.040]   we say, "Alexa, set an alarm for five minutes."
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.160]   And then she knows she's not supposed to talk for five minutes
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.560]   because she just talks so much.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.280]   She asks questions about everything.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.800]   And it's better for me because, like, when I come home,
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.760]   I miss Addie so much that, like,
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.240]   when she asks me questions, I'm all patient, you know?
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.600]   But for Keziah, she hears it 24 hours a day, you know?
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.360]   Or 12 hours or whatever.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.280]   And then, and so Keziah has been saying this a lot lately.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.240]   She says, "Addie, you don't need to know everything."
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.120]   'Cause Addie is like, "Why is this happening?
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.960]   "So how come that?
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.960]   "Well, why do I have to eat this one and this one?"
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.680]   You know, and then so all of these things are happening.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.280]   And Keziah says, "You don't need to know everything.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.760]   "Just trust that we're doing what's best for you,
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.920]   "and we'll tell you what you need to know."
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.800]   And she's so adamant about it.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.280]   She goes, "Oh, okay."
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.400]   And then, like, two seconds later, she's at it again.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.480]   And yet we live like this.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.800]   We ask questions after questions after questions.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   "God, how can you do this?
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.640]   "Why this?
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.480]   "Why not this?
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.320]   "How come I can't date her?"
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.520]   (shouting)
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.320]   And all these different things, and it's just,
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.160]   it's okay.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.640]   You don't need to know everything.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.720]   You know,
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.920]   we're gonna come across a lot of times in our lives
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.760]   where we don't trust God
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.800]   because he hasn't answered our questions.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.200]   And it's gonna play this pivotal role
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   in our unbelief and a faith that shatters underneath us.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.280]   But we don't need to know everything.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.120]   We don't need to know everything.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.600]   Here's a question for us.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.960]   You know, when we ask God,
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.240]   and we shake up our fists at God,
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.200]   and we say, "Why this?
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.760]   "How can you do this?"
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.280]   Who do you think you are?
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.440]   And that's not me asking you that question.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.440]   I took that straight out of, like, Job.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.040]   When all these guys are talking about
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.200]   what's going on with Job, and why he's suffering,
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.520]   why all these things are happening,
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.680]   and Job himself is saying all these things,
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.520]   and it's like, oh, all this talking going on for chapters,
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.480]   and chapters, and chapters, and chapters.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.280]   You're just flipping, flipping, flipping.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.720]   It's just man talking, man talking, man talking,
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.160]   man talking, man talking, and God zooms in,
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   and he says, "Who do you think you are?"
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.960]   Have you guys ever seen, like, two people
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   who have no idea what they're talking about?
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.880]   And, like, from a distance,
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.480]   you just hear them talking about something,
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.320]   and you're like, "Oh, my gosh.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:44.080]   "This is making me feel a little nauseous
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.080]   "how they're talking about this thing."
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.520]   You know?
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.480]   And that's what we do.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:57.560]   God is the one who knows across galaxies
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.960]   what's happening on the furthest star.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.720]   He knows exactly right now what's happening
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.160]   at the bottom of the sea.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.480]   He knows which molecule is out of place in our body.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.320]   He knows what's happening in the heart
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.720]   right now of our president.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.640]   He knows what's going on with, you know,
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.280]   all of these different things in life.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.120]   He sees everything, not just in breadth, but in depth.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.040]   He sees every dark corner, not of just of the world
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.880]   and the universe, but of every heart.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.120]   And he is sovereign, and he is in control,
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.280]   and he is doing all these things.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.560]   And so, in that, who are we to ask God?
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.440]   "I know better.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.720]   "This is not how you should be doing things.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.400]   "We don't know."
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.560]   So all that to say, it's okay
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.480]   that we don't know what he wrote here.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.280]   Let's ask him, yeah?
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.560]   When we go up, we'll ask him, what were those things?
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.080]   And we'll see if he says, like,
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.680]   "You don't need to know or not."
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.680]   And so here, we see this angel,
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.320]   and this angel kind of puts up his right hand
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.080]   and he makes an oath before God, he swears.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.560]   And so this next bullet point here,
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.120]   the angel swears that there would be no more delay
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.000]   in God's judgment.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.880]   That's an important word, delay.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.000]   The fulfillment of the mystery of God to the prophets
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.600]   is all the judgment promises given to them
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.240]   in the OT, in the Old Testament.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:38.360]   So it says this in Daniel 12, verse five through nine.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.920]   I have it up here for you guys.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.760]   "Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others stood,
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.080]   "one on this bank of the stream
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.760]   "and one on that bank of the stream.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.200]   "And someone said to the man clothed in linen
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.160]   "who was above the waters of the stream,
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.840]   "how long shall it be till the end of these wonders?
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.720]   "And I heard the man clothed in linen
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.000]   "who was above the waters of the stream.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.960]   "He raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.920]   "and swore by him who lives forever
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.160]   "that it would be for a time, times, and half a time.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.560]   "And that when the shattering of the power
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.440]   "of the holy people comes to an end,
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.640]   "all these things would be finished.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.000]   "I heard, but I did not understand.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.600]   "Then I said, oh my Lord,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.120]   "what shall be the outcome of these things?
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.120]   "He said, go your way, Daniel,
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.640]   "for the words are shut up
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.000]   "and sealed until the time of the end."
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.760]   A lot of this, I hope now this language
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.520]   is starting to get a little bit more familiar to you.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.880]   There's an image here of this guy
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.560]   who's holding up his hand,
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.040]   making a swear, an oath up to God.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.840]   And he says, and it says, this response comes back
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.560]   and says these things are gonna be sealed till the end.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.200]   And what we're seeing in Revelation
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.880]   is the unsealing of these things.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.200]   It's a revelation of these things.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:56.000]   And so this is the completion of God's judgment.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.960]   That this is it.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.320]   We've come to the point in Revelation
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.800]   where there will be no more delay.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.080]   The fullness of God's wrath is going to be unleashed here.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:06.920]   We're gonna be seeing it.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.960]   This is the finale that we're gonna be seeing
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.880]   from this point on.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:16.320]   In Revelation chapter six, verse 10,
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.120]   if you could turn back there.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.640]   It's just a page back.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   It says, and this is talking about the slain souls.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.040]   "They cried out with a loud voice,
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.880]   "'Oh, sovereign Lord, holy and true,
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.960]   "'how long before you will judge and avenge our blood
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.720]   "'on those who dwell on the earth?'"
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.160]   And then now what we see in chapter 10
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.040]   is the answer to that.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.640]   No more delay.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.920]   Vengeance is going to be coming now.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.200]   The Lord is responding.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.480]   Next bullet point down here.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.440]   The human heart demands justice
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.920]   in cases of evil and wickedness.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.520]   Oh, I built this in, cool.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.440]   Okay, turn to your neighbor
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.720]   and talk about examples you've seen
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.160]   where you felt like that,
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.800]   that like, you know when like,
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.240]   the justice part of you rises up?
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.880]   So it could be based on something you've seen
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.240]   like in a courtroom setting
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.320]   or like some kind of criminal activity
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.960]   or even something you've heard someone say to another person,
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.800]   those kinds of things.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.960]   So I know this one might be a little harder
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.920]   to kind of come up with,
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.560]   but turn to a neighbor and talk about something like that,
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.480]   like where you've seen your heart responding
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.240]   in a demand for justice.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.400]   (silence)
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:36.600]   This could take a moment to think
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.840]   because I know you have to kind of rack it a little.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.080]   (sniffles)
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:58.080]   Maybe it could even be something
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.720]   your parents said to you or something.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.240]   So different ideas like that.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.400]   (audience chattering)
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.640]   (sniffles)
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.600]   (sniffles)
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.760]   (audience chattering)
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.000]   (sniffles)
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:34.800]   (audience chattering)
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.840]   (sniffles)
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.000]   (audience chattering)
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.160]   (audience chattering)
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.320]   (audience chattering)
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.480]   (audience chattering)
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.640]   (audience chattering)
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.920]   (sniffles)
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:10.080]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.240]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:26.400]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:38.600]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.760]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.920]   (audience chattering)
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.720]   Oh, I'm hearing some good ones, but,
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.560]   (laughs)
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.720]   there are some interesting ones that are here.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.880]   Cool, okay.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.960]   You guys could finish up your story.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:34.480]   Well, you know, there is definitely
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:39.160]   this understanding of justice in our lives, right?
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.600]   We feel like it's just built into us.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.160]   Justice.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.120]   You know, I remember how early it was built into me.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.280]   I remember the first time I felt rage
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.760]   because of justice was in first grade.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.560]   We're all standing in line to get big sticks.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.960]   They're 25 cents each.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.120]   And the line's always Thursday, minimum.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.280]   They were so long.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.440]   I was at the very back,
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.360]   and I saw someone cut to the very second person in line.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.320]   And then I saw them, I was like, "What?"
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.280]   And then I remember them getting the big stick
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.600]   and walking away.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.680]   I'm like, "Ah, that's not fair."
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.560]   And I was standing in line for another 10 minutes.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.480]   Like, it's built into us.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.760]   From an early age, I would watch movies
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.560]   where the bad guy would get away with it too easily.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:30.320]   I wanna be careful with,
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.160]   (laughs)
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.960]   Yoshi and Emmett are here.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.720]   But like, you know, sometimes,
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.200]   their existence would cease.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.880]   And then at the end, I'd be like, "No!
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.960]   "No, they got away with it.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.240]   "They did all this bad stuff in the middle of the movie.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.240]   "How can they get away with it like that?
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.360]   "That's not fair."
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.080]   And it was just built into us, you know?
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.400]   Like, they just ceased existing.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.600]   You know, that's not fair.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.720]   So like, it's definitely built into us.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.800]   And that's why the human heart,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   it really does demand justice in cases of evil and wickedness.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.960]   And there's that point right there.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.960]   That it demands that some form of evil
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.440]   must be repaid by something else.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.440]   And here, as we're seeing the Lord responding in judgment,
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:29.640]   what I see is such a un-clarity, un-clear.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:34.560]   We have such unclear understandings of justice.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.280]   Even the most righteous of us, right?
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.560]   Like, we look at these things,
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.280]   and we deem what's good and what's evil,
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.760]   and yet God, he sees it so clearly
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.520]   that somehow, beyond even our own understanding,
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.600]   that sin requires such a great judgment as this.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:57.520]   We see his clarity of sight in justice.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.280]   Any person that has ever said, "This isn't fair.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.280]   "They can't get away with it,"
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.720]   should be pointing a finger right back at themselves
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.240]   and saying the same thing before God.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.000]   How, how?
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.040]   What am I to do?
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.520]   I can't get away with this.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.840]   And so the human heart, it demands justice.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.960]   And when we see clearly, it's different.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.040]   Think about in your own life,
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.080]   when someone sins against you, lies to you, backstabs you.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.960]   And even going through Romans 12, verse 9 through 21
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.720]   with Pastor Peter, hasn't it been so convicting lately?
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.040]   Man, I come out, and I'm like,
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.560]   dude, (laughs)
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.160]   that was not cool, Pastor Peter.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.680]   Now my life has to change, and that's, ah.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.280]   You know, because we're beginning to see
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.160]   that in these things, it's so hard to do.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.920]   When someone sins against us and lies against us
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.280]   and backstabs us, we feel the sense of justice,
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.400]   and we'll see that again more at the end of Romans 12.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.520]   But the sense of justice that we have,
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.440]   and it shows but a glimpse of God's heart
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:17.160]   and that he is going to be fair,
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.560]   and there is going to be no crime that goes unpunished.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:26.040]   And to know that God sees everything and knows everything,
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:30.840]   not just all the crimes and all the things that we see
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.480]   in the criminal justice system,
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:37.560]   and the myriads, the thousands, the millions of crimes
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.600]   that are probably happening today
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.080]   without it being judged in a court,
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.720]   and then to know the depth of our own hearts,
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.640]   to see how deep wickedness and evil goes,
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:54.360]   and to look up at a judge and to demand justice,
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.320]   justice, God, vengeance, God.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.960]   This is not specifically talking about
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.120]   against the people who martyred these slain souls.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.400]   This is talking about judgment upon an unbelieving world.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:13.440]   And so for every person who escapes God's judgment,
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.440]   and so I'm talking about any Christian sitting in this room,
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:22.200]   that punishment does not go unpunished.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:27.040]   Like, do we recognize that in the way we live?
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.800]   That that punishment was paid for by Christ.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.600]   And to understand the gravity of Christ
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   taking the sins of the world is a staggering concept,
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:48.040]   especially when we see how fiercely God judges the earth here.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:54.120]   And so this next bullet point down,
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.760]   God will fulfill complete, I wanna emphasize that,
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.840]   complete justice and judgment upon the earth to redeem it.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.840]   Everything, every single thing,
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.200]   no matter how big, no matter how small,
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.480]   and we think about it in terms of things done,
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.600]   but to the depths of the essence of our hearts,
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.080]   that we don't just do sinful things, that we are sinners,
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.200]   that these things are going to be brought
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.720]   to complete justice and judgment at the end,
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.680]   whether upon unbelievers themselves,
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.360]   or for anyone who placed their faith in Christ,
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.320]   upon his own son.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:40.440]   Complete justice and judgment upon the earth,
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.520]   and don't lose this part, to redeem it.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.640]   God is redeeming.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.760]   In Revelation, that's what we're seeing.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.640]   God is taking back the title deed to the earth.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.520]   He's saying, I'm going to save not just individuals,
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.680]   but everything, all of creation is going to be redeemed.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:04.960]   So looking down here now at verse eight,
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.280]   let's finish this up, this is the very last point.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.920]   Then the voice that I had heard from heaven
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.320]   spoke to me again, saying,
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.000]   "Go, take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.160]   "who is standing on the sea and on the land."
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.480]   So I went to the angel and told him
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.920]   to give me the little scroll.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.040]   And he said to me, "Take and eat it.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.120]   "It will make your stomach bitter,
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.280]   "but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey."
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.320]   And I took the little scroll
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.160]   from the hand of the angel and ate it.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.520]   It was sweet as honey in my mouth,
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.080]   but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.840]   And I was told, "You must again prophesy
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.800]   "about many peoples and nations, and languages and kings."
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.640]   So John is told, here's the bullet point,
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.440]   to eat the scroll, which will be sweet in the mouth,
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.760]   bitter in the stomach.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.320]   This means that the message will be sweet
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.200]   to the faithful believer who will be avenged,
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.600]   but the stomach will be made bitter
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.160]   by the terrible judgment poured out
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.240]   as a result of sin and evil.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:05.120]   Okay, so let's bring everything together in this chapter.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.920]   There's an angel holding a little scroll.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.560]   And this scroll is the fullness of truth,
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.160]   of the gospel, of everything that needs to be revealed.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.400]   It's seen in the fact that it's an open scroll.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.000]   And then these voices call out,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.880]   and there's more things that are supposed to happen,
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.840]   more things that we don't need to know about.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.680]   And then John is told to eat the scroll.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.200]   Weird.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.760]   Says that he eats it, and it's like,
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.400]   "Mm, that tastes like honey.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.840]   "Oh, my stomach, it doesn't feel good.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.640]   "Why, what's going on here?"
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.600]   Well, in verse 11, that's where we see the clue.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.440]   He was told, "You must again prophesy
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.160]   "about many peoples and nations and languages and kings."
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.960]   So whatever he ingested, he is to speak.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.520]   And whatever he ingested,
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.200]   it's gonna be sweet to the mouth,
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.560]   but it's gonna leave a bitterness in his stomach.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:01.880]   That's the gospel for you, isn't it?
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.160]   It's so sweet.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.800]   It is just the sweetest thing, this word of God.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.480]   And yet, as you've been reading through Revelation,
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.720]   hasn't it been leaving you
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.400]   with a bitterness in your stomach?
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:18.720]   Oh, man, this judgment, it's okay to,
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:24.800]   this judgment that's coming is hard to swallow.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.200]   And yet, what is John called to do?
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.040]   Preach it.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.600]   He's called to speak it.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.440]   How many of us, as we've been talking about
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.600]   this week after week, have talked about people
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.280]   we wanna share the gospel to,
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.560]   and yet have not done it out of a fear
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.600]   of making that person feel uncomfortable,
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:51.440]   of making a relationship shaky,
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:56.640]   because of the fear of that bitterness in the stomach,
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.200]   so I won't speak it.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:03.600]   And yet, that is what we're called to do.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.240]   We're called to go and preach
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.440]   knowing there is bitterness in this message.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.400]   It's a call to go to your roommates,
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.200]   go to your classmates, go to your friends,
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.520]   your parents, your brothers and sisters.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.360]   You go to them, and you take them
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.520]   the full message of the gospel, sweet and bitter and all.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:31.480]   This is the only loving thing you can do.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.280]   If you find yourself talking about
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.280]   so many superficial things,
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.360]   talking about, okay, what did the professor say
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.040]   in this class, or did you see that last episode
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.760]   of whatever, and you're talking about
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.440]   all these different things, and yet,
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.640]   you have not spoken to them the gospel,
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.280]   that is messed up of you.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.400]   And I point this way, knowing that fingers
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.880]   are pointing right back at me.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.720]   That for us, we need to understand this,
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:04.360]   that this is something, as hard as it is,
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.760]   we are called to proclaim it.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.560]   We must do this.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.800]   It can't be an option for us to not.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.000]   And so, we are gonna be breaking up
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.280]   into groups again and talking in a different way
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.720]   because our table groups are all funky right now.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:24.360]   But I wanna ask us to really push each other to this.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.000]   If we really believe in what we're reading,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.120]   and week after week, there is a similar message.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.920]   I was talking to Diane, and she was like,
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.240]   it's always the same message, just be sober,
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.600]   things like that.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.360]   It is the same message in the midst of God's wrath
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.160]   and judgment that's coming, and yet,
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.640]   I think every time it's spoken,
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.080]   and every time we share it,
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.280]   if there is no change in our lives,
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:51.080]   that is more judgment on us.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.480]   And so, would you really do it?
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.880]   Would you make those active,
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:01.480]   those volitional decisions today?
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.080]   To say, because of this, I am going to change
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.200]   the way I live.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.160]   Because of these things that I see,
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.120]   I'm not gonna just talk about,
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.360]   you guys are gonna be going through questions
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.520]   three, four, and five, so skip one and two,
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.480]   but in those questions, one of the questions
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.400]   is gonna talk about what deadens you,
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.880]   what deadens you in your life to this message.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.840]   But don't just talk about, honestly,
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.520]   I think I watch a little bit too much TV,
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.320]   and this sucks as a message coming right into spring break,
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.920]   I know, because some of you guys are like,
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.400]   oh, I cannot wait to watch eight hours of this show.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.200]   Like, I have been saving up for this,
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.880]   and you're gonna unleash your sinfulness this week.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.760]   Well, talk to each other and say,
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.000]   like, you know, in this sober message
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.480]   that's being seen here, then how is your life
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.280]   going to change?
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.320]   And then change.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:51.360]   Trust what it's saying, and go live in obedience.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.720]   And we need to do this together.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.480]   My hope is that as we go, and even, I know,
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.040]   it's kinda, I hope that the board games we play
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.840]   and stuff doesn't, like, deaden us some more,
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.320]   but as we go, I hope that it's a collective effort
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.160]   we're making here, that we're holding hands
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.800]   and going out into this world saying, like,
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.440]   we're all part of the same message.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.920]   We're not people who happen to go to UCI,
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.480]   and like, so we found Berean, and so we're doing Berean,
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.240]   but that we are Christians,
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.760]   loving God with all our hearts, so in love with God,
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.160]   our lives are for Him, everything we do is for Him,
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.360]   and so when people think of a Berean,
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.440]   they think of someone who loves God,
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.360]   who loves His word, who lives a life
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.080]   that is strikingly different from the rest of this world,
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.840]   and who's making sacrifices,
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.320]   understanding that they're not really sacrifices,
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.440]   because it's so easy to give up these things
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.480]   in the place of living a lifestyle
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.360]   that is holy and completely sold out for Christ,
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.360]   to love Him in all the different things that we're doing,
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.760]   that putting down, you know, not playing some video games
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.960]   or not playing, like, watching some TV shows,
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.760]   that these things aren't sacrifices to us,
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.280]   that our desire is to go home,
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.880]   and this wind-down time that I think
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.920]   that I need to do all these things before I go to sleep,
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.240]   these things are not important,
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.760]   and it's not a sacrifice, I want to use these times
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.240]   to maybe go and have a conversation with my roommate,
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.120]   with my parents, with whoever I'm gonna go and see,
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.120]   or to spend some time in prayer,

[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.200]   headed into spring break for many of us,
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:48.480]   I pray, God, that this wouldn't be an interesting book to us,
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.880]   in that it just...
