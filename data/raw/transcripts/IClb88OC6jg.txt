[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:27.580]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.420]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.980]   Romans chapter eight, verse 28, it reads,
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.180]   that we know that God causes all things to work together
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.580]   for good to those who love God,
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.020]   to those who are called according to his purpose.
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.460]   I pray this morning we can be reminded
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.500]   of God's faithfulness in our lives,
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.180]   that in any season we might be going through,
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.220]   even through the toughest trials,
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.340]   he is working in us to yield the fruit of righteousness
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.620]   and a deeper love and joy in Christ,
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.260]   to make us more like him
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.660]   and to one day be with him in full glory.

[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:30.460]   - All right, good morning.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.380]   Welcome to Prairie Community Church.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.780]   Let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.580]   First of all, a family ministry picnic is happening today
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.220]   at 11.30 to 3.30.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.420]   So after this service at the Bill Barber Memorial Park,
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.180]   it's informal, so you grab your lunch and then go,
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.860]   and if you wanna meet other family members
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.740]   and married couples, they're gonna be there till 3.30.
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.820]   So that's happening today from 11.30 to 3.30 p.m.
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.340]   And then FAM 245 on Memorial Day weekend,
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.260]   this coming Saturday,
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.980]   there's gonna be a barbecue at 11 to 2 p.m.
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.980]   So if you are a part of that ministry, they're having that.
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.140]   And then India Pastor Support.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.340]   If you are praying or you wanna help out with that,
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.580]   a $50 a month or $600 one-time gift
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.780]   to support our Indian pastors to be able to do the work
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.980]   that they're doing out in that area.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.220]   VBS Sign Up, please sign up for that.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.180]   That's happening on July 15th.
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.020]   And also the family ministry retreat
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.540]   that's happening in August.
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.380]   The pre-registration is gonna be happening.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.700]   Early registration is happening until June 2nd, okay?
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.700]   God's design for marriage.
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.980]   And one last thing, as you were coming in,
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.860]   you might have seen a table stationed outside.
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.060]   What that table is, they're taking sign-ups
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.500]   or not sign-ups for petition.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.260]   They're trying to add, I guess,
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.100]   an amendment to what's already passed.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.500]   They're trying to put it on November 2026.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.240]   So if they have enough signatures,
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.080]   they're gonna put this in.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.760]   And what this is, basically,
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.700]   the law has already passed in California.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.300]   Again, as you guys know, we're living
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.700]   in one of the most liberal states in the country.
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.460]   And basically, this petition is to ask
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.380]   that the schools require to contact the parents
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.220]   if their student is having whatever,
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.740]   like counseling for gender identity type of stuff.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.020]   It protects girls' sports so that males
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.680]   who are saying that they're females cannot compete.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.480]   And then finally, that there would be,
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.020]   they would prevent sterilization of children,
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.400]   prohibiting the state from using puberty blockers
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.000]   and hormones and mastectomies to minors, to young children.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.340]   As ridiculous as this is,
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.460]   this is what's going on around this.
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.460]   And so the fact that we even have
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.420]   to petition the state to not do this,
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.380]   I mean, it's pretty crazy, the era that we're living in.
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.020]   But as you're exiting, there will be a table set up out there
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.540]   so if you have time, please stop by there
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.240]   and just sign your name and petition on there.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.940]   And they'll add that to the names.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.140]   And if we have enough names,
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.620]   they're gonna put this on the ballot.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.260]   And then eventually, it will come out
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.740]   so that we can vote on it, okay?
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.860]   So all this stuff was passed through California Congress
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.500]   without notification, they just made a decision.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.420]   And so we're asking that we would get a say,
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.300]   at least the voters would get a say on this.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.340]   Okay, so that's why the table's set up out there
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.100]   and it will be there all throughout,
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.680]   after the second service and also the third service, okay?
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.740]   Let me pray for our offering and after that,
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.420]   our brother Josh Chung is gonna come
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.140]   and give his testimony and be baptized this morning.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:47.980]   Let's pray.
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:55.260]   Gracious Father, we pray that you would bless this time
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.860]   and whatever it is, Lord God,
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.300]   that we have been entangled with before we came to worship,
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.900]   that you would help us to lift our eyes to Christ,
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.700]   reorient us, cause us, Lord God,
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.220]   to fix our eyes upon Christ.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.540]   Let our worship, Lord God,
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.580]   help us that the worship that we give you
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.340]   will be in spirit and in truth.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.340]   I pray that you would bless this offering.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.580]   May it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.440]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.060]   (gentle music)

[00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:17.420]   Let us all rise and before we continue on with our service,
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.320]   let's spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.900]   (gentle music)

[00:22:44.860 --> 00:23:09.800]   - Hey everyone, my name is Josh and this is my testimony.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.140]   I grew up in a Christian family
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.560]   where I followed my parents to church from a young age.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.340]   I was your typical Sunday Christian who kept everything,
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.200]   needed to be a true believer in the back burner.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.720]   As I grew more independent over time,
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.200]   I stopped going to church consistently
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.720]   and by the time I was in high school,
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   having fun and life was my top priority.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.440]   Around my sophomore year in high school,
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.760]   a close friend invited me to go to this church.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.360]   Because I could finally make my own decision,
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.440]   I felt pushed to try it out.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.320]   I enjoyed and stayed for the friends I met
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.520]   until I was asked if I wanted to take a Bible study
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.040]   that would eventually lead me to making the choice
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.680]   to receive Christ as my savior.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.320]   At this time, I still thought of myself to be a believer
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.620]   but wanted to affirm it as I was now older
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.220]   and significant time has passed.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.680]   I eventually finished the Bible study
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.680]   and affirmed my faith in Christ as a believer.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.480]   Habitual patterns turned into real desire
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.200]   to learn more about God, attend church
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.800]   and praise and prayer nights.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.200]   I joined the praise team, served
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.260]   and went through active introspection.
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.540]   However, my first year of community college,
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.440]   I began to stagnate in my growth.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.880]   I watched as many fellow members
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.680]   in the church left their professed faith.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.680]   Of those in my grade, about half remained.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.520]   I didn't realize how disassociated I felt
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.380]   from the church community until I transferred
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.840]   to university in Los Angeles.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.840]   I was away from my home church and from Christian friends.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.400]   My closest group of friends were those who left the church
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.440]   and were no longer believers.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.320]   In LA, I attempted to keep on maturing
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.840]   and growing as a Christian by finding a fellowship
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.320]   in a new church to attend to during the time I was there.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   However, I began to feel and grow more isolated
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.440]   from other Christians, especially in a new church
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.920]   I knew I was only gonna stay in for the next two years.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.360]   After facing some discouragement from one of the churches,
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.480]   I came to a conclusion that I did not need a church
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.240]   to continue my faith.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.480]   Their self-reliance and the disappointment
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.240]   in seeing professed Christians living
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.240]   and acting in worldly ways,
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.680]   as well as a number of other factors, my pride grew.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.620]   As I watched fruit being born from seemingly
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.360]   the result of my personal actions,
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.640]   my vanity and arrogance grew.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.560]   And during this time, prayer and reading the Bible
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.200]   became more methodical than intentional.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.960]   By the time I graduated in 2020,
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.560]   my priorities had shifted to becoming more career-focused.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.320]   Around the summer of 2021, my mom was diagnosed with cancer
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.120]   as I started a new job, which I had high hopes for.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.160]   Life became much heavier and exhausting
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.920]   from busy seasons at work to the logistics
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.160]   and emotions of dealing with the cancer,
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.760]   and then subsequently hospice care.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.920]   In 2022, she passed away, and what I thought
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.800]   was experienced faith built up over a long period of time,
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.340]   crumbled to its foundations.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:47.080]   Due to pride I couldn't let go of,
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.800]   I kept my thoughts and feelings to myself
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.120]   from the remaining family members,
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.720]   became distant friends I didn't want to rely on,
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.180]   and a church I attended but felt I didn't belong to.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.880]   I was completely burned out and isolated.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.780]   My physical, mental, and emotional health were a mess.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.560]   For the first time in my life I felt completely lost,
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.520]   and I mentally gave up on everything in my life,
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.880]   on myself and others and ideals and material things.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.960]   Every conviction and dream and hope I had
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.120]   no longer meant anything to me.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.840]   I questioned God's existence.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.800]   I was at a crossroads where I had to come
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.640]   to an absolute realization if my belief was real or not.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.160]   At my lowest point, I very deeply wanted my life
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.680]   to come to an end, but realized
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.040]   that could not justify it in my heart.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.020]   There was an unceasing hope left in me
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.960]   that I initially tried to block out
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.200]   and was even sickened by.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.240]   I believed in God, but still questioned his love.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.560]   I complained and prayed in desperation
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.200]   and was eventually overwhelmed and overpowered.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.500]   I could no longer push back God's love for me.
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.000]   I could not reject the goodness and greatness
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.720]   that he had shown to me throughout my life,
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.240]   and I knew I wasn't the one to dictate my own life or death.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.180]   I was his servant, and I should abide by his will,
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.440]   not the other way around.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.120]   For the first time, I was faced with many ups and downs,
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.480]   as I struggled with the hope in Christ I believed,
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.140]   but often could not clearly see.
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.800]   In this place where I found difficulty
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.960]   in opening up to people and committing to churches,
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.760]   I was drawn to the word.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.360]   In Ecclesiastes 1, I was reminded of the futility
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.760]   and waste of my efforts on earth that were not for God,
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.300]   as well as my self-perceived wisdom.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.360]   There began the slow process of giving up my pride
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.280]   through real repentance and remembrance
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.720]   of the work done by the Holy Spirit, by God.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.920]   First Corinthians 3, five through seven.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.880]   What then is Apollos, and what is Paul?
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.640]   Servants through whom you believed,
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.880]   even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.480]   I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.840]   So then neither the one who plants
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.380]   nor the one who waters is anything,
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.880]   but God who causes the growth.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.960]   Over time, as I prayed and read the word,
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.720]   God also provided me with much to rest them of.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.480]   I felt especially comforted with the words
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.380]   and imagery from the Shepherd's Song.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.120]   As God healed me to a new normal through his word,
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.840]   praise, and prayers, sermons, and people around me,
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.000]   I started to gain a strong desire to want to serve more
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.200]   and to be a deeper part of a community of believers.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.000]   When I was invited to Burien by a friend,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.600]   I felt that it was an appropriate time to start anew
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.560]   in finding a church with intention to grow
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.400]   and recontinue a life to thank, serve, and glorify God.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.840]   Thank you.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.840]   (audience applauds)
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.500]   (water gurgles)
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:45.800]   - Joshua, do you understand when you go into the water,
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.480]   you're being your eyes to Christ's death.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.320]   Then when you come out,
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.800]   you're being your eyes to his resurrected life.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   I baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.980]   (water gurgles)
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.980]   (audience applauds)
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:11.120]   - All right, thank you, Joshua,
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.960]   for that encouraging testimony.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.860]   If you could turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter eight,
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.740]   and I'll be reading from verse 11 through 15.
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.320]   (pages rustle)
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:30.080]   Luke chapter eight, verse 11 through 15.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:36.060]   "Now the parable is this.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.700]   "The seed is the word of God.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.660]   "Those besides the road are those who have heard.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.960]   "Then the devil comes and takes away the word
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.260]   "from their heart so that they will not believe and be saved.
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.520]   "Those on the rocky soil are those who, when they hear,
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.660]   "receive the word with joy, and these have no firm root.
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:53.860]   "They believe for a while,
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.540]   "and in time of temptation, fall away.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.740]   "The seed which fell among the thorns,
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.860]   "these are the ones who have heard,
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.260]   "and as they go on their way,
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.660]   "they are choked with worries,
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.420]   "and riches, and pleasures of this life,
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.420]   "and bring no fruit to maturity.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.860]   "But the seed in the good soil,
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.780]   "these are the ones who have heard the word
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.500]   "in an honest and good heart,
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.460]   "and hold it fast and bear fruit with perseverance."
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.300]   Let's pray.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.020]   Father, we pray that you would give us
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.480]   understanding of your word.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.720]   Help us, Lord God, to give our full attention
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.720]   and lean our ears towards you,
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.800]   and that your word, Lord, would speak to us,
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.240]   illuminate us, guide us, and lead us this morning.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.960]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.240]   If you can turn your Bible just briefly
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.120]   to Jonah chapter three, I wanna give you an example
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.040]   of what we've been talking about,
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.760]   how God chooses a reluctant servant
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.700]   and brings repentance and revival
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.900]   to this brutal nation, the Assyrians,
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.820]   and I think, to give an example,
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:58.500]   again, an illustration of what true repentance looks like.
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:03.180]   If you, again, know the Book of Jonah,
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.140]   oftentimes you hear the preaching of the Book of Jonah,
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.860]   and they completely take it out of the context,
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.100]   'cause I've heard people say, "Don't mess with God,
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.940]   "or a whale's gonna eat you up," right?
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.620]   So you can't run from God, God's gonna chase after you,
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.860]   so don't run from God, and all of these things
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.660]   may be, in some way, be true,
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.740]   but the main point of the Book of Jonah
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.700]   is a rebuke toward a nation of Israel,
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.580]   because they have forgotten their calling.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.660]   They were created so that they may bring glory to God,
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.460]   that they may demonstrate who he is
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:37.000]   to the rest of the world, and during this period of time,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.480]   Israel has forgotten their identity.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.580]   They were only concerned about themselves,
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.900]   and bringing glory to the other nation
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.220]   was not their priority, so that's why this book ends
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.460]   with God basically telling Jonah and rebuking Jonah,
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.240]   and then it just ends that way, right?
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.580]   Well, if you look at it,
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.820]   Jonah is probably the worst person to call
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.580]   to bring revival to the Assyrians.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.540]   These were brutal people, and they were hated,
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.380]   and Jonah hated them, and you can tell,
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.500]   because when they repent, instead of celebrating,
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.980]   he pouts, and he complains.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.460]   I knew this is who you are, that you're slow in anger,
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.900]   and you're patient and gracious,
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.100]   and this is exactly the reason why I didn't wanna go,
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.460]   'cause I didn't wanna see them repent,
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.940]   and yet God chose Jonah, knowing that he would be
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:26.200]   a horrible messenger of what God has called him to do,
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.560]   so it says in verse four,
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.880]   "Jonah began to go through the city one day's walk,
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.080]   "and cried out and said,
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.580]   "Yet 40 days and then about will be overthrown."
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.420]   It's interesting when he says he cried out.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.460]   Typically, when we cry it out,
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.020]   you would see an evangelist crying out,
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.420]   "Repent, for God wants to forgive you of your sins,"
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.520]   but can you imagine what that crying out
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.260]   must have sounded like from Jonah?
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.420]   Because he actually wanted them to be judged.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.060]   He was just crying out, "Condemnation, right?
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.260]   "You Assyrians are gonna be judged,"
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.660]   and so you could tell,
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.860]   he's not pleading with them to repent.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.460]   He's basically telling them,
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:06.320]   "You're being judged because you're a horrible nation."
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.460]   But what's interesting is, despite the context,
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.740]   despite this reluctant man,
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:14.760]   it says in verse five,
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.680]   "Then the people of Nineveh believed in God,
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.500]   "and they called it fast and put on sackcloth
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.300]   "from the greatest to the least of them."
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.740]   I mean, can you imagine if evangelism was like that?
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.380]   We just went out and say, "God is angry with you,"
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.460]   and it's like, "Okay, I'm gonna repent," right?
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.780]   Why did they repent?
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.020]   Considering what he was saying,
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.060]   this is a prophet from a nation that they've conquered
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.460]   and they were brutal against.
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:45.340]   Well, it doesn't tell us in this story,
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.220]   but the background story is,
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.360]   during this period, before Jonah even shows up,
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.660]   God was already doing work here.
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.380]   It says, according to historical record,
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:59.060]   there was a tremendous earthquake that shook up this city,
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.540]   and there was a famine,
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.660]   and so there was a lot of turmoil in the city,
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.060]   which caused an upheaval, and there was infighting,
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.460]   and so there was all this chaos going on,
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.520]   and so God wasn't just simply calling Jonah
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.820]   to go to just anywhere.
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.420]   He was already doing the background work
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.600]   so that when he said, "These things are happening
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.740]   "because God is angry with your sin,"
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:22.660]   they were already ready,
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:23.980]   and they said, "That's the reason.
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.540]   "God has sent the prophet,"
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:28.840]   and so that's why they relented and they repented.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.140]   Now, I don't know if you've been paying attention,
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.700]   and I've been saying this many times,
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:40.100]   that the pandemic has created an atmosphere of evangelism
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.620]   that I have not seen in many, many years.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.860]   Those of you who are new to Christianity
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.780]   may not have something to compare with,
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.780]   but in the last 40-some years,
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.280]   I've seen more people interested and concerned
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.540]   about life and death and meaning of life
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.140]   than I've seen in decades,
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.620]   and that's not something that we did.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:00.980]   God created an atmosphere,
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.140]   so if you're living day-to-day
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.260]   only concerned about yourself,
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.300]   you may not be aware of that,
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.340]   but if you've ever tried to share the gospel
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.920]   in the last 10-plus years,
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.620]   you'll notice that there has been a stirring of people,
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.260]   and I just mentioned this on a side note,
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.700]   but because this is what was happening.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.940]   Jonah went in because there was already concern and fear
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.260]   that God created in this city,
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.740]   so when he comes, that they repented,
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.820]   and again, I can imagine Jonah
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.140]   not being happy about their repentance.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.500]   This repentance was so deep
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.980]   that even the king, even the king makes a decree
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.300]   that we're gonna have this fast,
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.340]   no one's going to be normal,
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.820]   we're gonna come plead with the Lord,
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.060]   but look what he says in verse nine.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.500]   Who knows?
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.460]   God may turn and relent and withdraw his burning anger
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.760]   so that we will not perish.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.820]   That is an attitude of a true repentant, right?
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.680]   The way that the gospel has been presented today,
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:59.420]   that the representative of an offended God
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.280]   is basically pleading with sinners
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.560]   who offended this holy God to give him a chance.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.940]   Open your heart, what have you got to lose?
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.580]   And so, so many people in our generation
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.820]   expect the grace of God.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.700]   If I just say the right things, God's gonna forgive me.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.740]   That's what the Bible says, right?
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.180]   And he's supposed to.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.500]   He's supposed to do that.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.380]   Why isn't he?
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.180]   And so, when we pray and God doesn't answer,
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.220]   we think, what kind of a God is this?
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.700]   I thought he loved me.
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.700]   I thought he said he's gonna answer my prayer.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.500]   It makes absolutely no sense
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.580]   that the people who've offended God,
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.900]   and instead of bringing judgment upon us,
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.820]   he relents and he forgives us,
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.920]   and that we have churches filled with people
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.000]   pointing finger at God.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.980]   You didn't show up when I asked you to.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.980]   And I think the reason why is because of the way
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.420]   the gospel was presented in the first place.
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:51.780]   We didn't represent a holy God who was offended.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:58.020]   We were more concerned about those who offended God,
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.380]   that they would no longer be offended
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.000]   and give Jesus a chance.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.220]   See, what he says, who knows?
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.160]   Maybe this holy God will relent,
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.460]   and he would no longer be angry.
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.620]   That's the attitude of a penitent sinner
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:17.620]   who recognizes, who recognizes he's the creator, not me.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:23.000]   If he wanted, he could just snap his finger, and we're gone.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.300]   We don't have any power.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.060]   He has all the power,
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.560]   and he's the one that we've offended.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.100]   And then look what it says in verse 10.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:34.020]   When God saw their deeds, they turned from their wicked way,
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.960]   then God relented concerning the calamity
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.780]   which he had declared he would bring upon them,
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.460]   and he did not do it.
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.580]   What did God see?
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:46.300]   Their profession, raising of hand, coming down the aisle,
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.820]   their membership at a church.
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.180]   He said, when God saw their deeds,
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.860]   and they turned from their wicked ways.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.780]   So every instance where the gospel is presented,
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.000]   that's presented, repent.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.980]   Repent for the kingdom of heaven
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.660]   is that turn from your wicked ways.
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.260]   Acknowledge your wickedness,
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.320]   and turn away from the world, and turn to God.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.840]   That's the gospel that we see in the scripture.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.120]   But the gospel of our generation
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:19.880]   is sinners who have been offended by religiosity of God,
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.240]   and they're gonna, they almost think like
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.360]   they're doing God a favor by entering the church.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.560]   And as a result of that,
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.920]   the church has become what it has become.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.160]   Our first vision in the church
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.620]   is having God-centered worship.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:39.480]   Man-centered worship is not worship.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.480]   Man-centered worship is your being worshiped.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.600]   We come here to worship God.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.040]   We come here to celebrate God
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.340]   for what he has already done.
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.560]   Not to see what he's going to do,
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.280]   but to celebrate what he's already done.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.140]   And that's why the parable of the sower,
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.020]   a parable of the seed,
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.760]   is basically warning the disciples
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.100]   that these guys are all not coming for the right reason.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.280]   They're coming because they were fed, they saw miracles.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.540]   But as soon as I don't do what they want me to do,
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:10.380]   they're going to leave.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.280]   And he's warning the disciples.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.560]   And obviously it happens.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.700]   The more we study through Jesus' ministry,
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.360]   people are gonna leave one by one,
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:22.320]   and because Jesus doesn't live up to their expectation.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.760]   Because they never died, they never repented.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.040]   They never turned from their ways.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:31.040]   All they did was add something better to their old life.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.000]   They're still living in it.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.140]   They're still pursuing the world.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.440]   They're like, they're no different.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.120]   Outside of the fact that they are at church
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.400]   and they grew up in the church,
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.960]   their life looks no different.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.900]   All they've done is added Jesus
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.600]   to help them in their old life.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:52.000]   So he's telling them they will not last.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.400]   Eventually they will walk away.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.760]   First soil will leave because they don't believe.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:00.120]   Second soil because they don't have roots.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.720]   And then the third soil because of the concerns of life
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.160]   are gonna choke the word of God
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.240]   and they're not gonna bear fruit
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.120]   and they're going to go.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.680]   And then he said the fourth soil,
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.900]   the quality, we talked about two of them last week,
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.820]   that they have a good heart.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:18.060]   Good and honest heart meaning that they heard,
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.220]   they heard the preaching of the gospel
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.260]   and they were convict and they were honest.
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.740]   They didn't make excuses for their sins.
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.680]   They didn't say, I am the way I am because of this,
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.980]   because of that, because of my circumstance.
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:30.960]   It's me.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.340]   And they were convicted and they accepted it.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.240]   Accepted it meaning they repented.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:40.900]   And then thirdly, Luke says that they held it fast.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.220]   Held it fast.
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.020]   In the NIV it says they retained it.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:48.940]   King James it says they kept it, to keep it.
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.700]   But another simple way to understand this
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:55.700]   considering this analogy that Jesus is giving,
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.520]   it basically took root.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:01.300]   The seed that was put into the ground
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:06.300]   began to take root in that ground and it became one.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.820]   So when the word of God goes forth,
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.000]   instead of just hearing it and not the other,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.860]   and superficially saying, oh I like that,
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:18.180]   I raise my hand, it began to grow.
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.460]   In contrast, we see that in Hebrews chapter six,
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.400]   four through six, Apostle Paul,
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.400]   which I believe this author is Apostle Paul,
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.340]   so if I say Paul, that's because that's my view.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:35.040]   Apostle Paul writes to the Hebrews
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.300]   and he's describing people who are part of the third soil.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.220]   They were in the church, they had every opportunity,
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.100]   they heard the word of God,
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:48.280]   they were near the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.980]   they're probably members in the church.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.140]   They've seen everything that a Christian could possibly,
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.500]   they had every opportunity to come to repentance
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.300]   and they turn away from God.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.700]   Look what it says, for in the case of those
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.580]   who have once been enlightened,
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.220]   enlightened meaning that they heard the gospel
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.860]   and then they tasted the heavenly gift.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:10.380]   They didn't eat it and digest it, they just tasted it.
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.460]   They have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.900]   The Holy Spirit was not indwelling in them,
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:19.180]   they just were partakers of them.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.820]   He said, and that they have tasted the good word of God.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:24.100]   The word of God did not convict them and change them
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.820]   and bring them to repentance, they just like hearing it,
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.820]   'cause it makes them feel good, they're encouraged by it.
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.060]   And the powers of the ages to come
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.920]   and then have fallen away,
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.560]   meaning every opportunity they've had
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.400]   to come to repentance, they've been exposed to.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.800]   They've been around Christians,
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.180]   the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.440]   They've been around the gift of the church,
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.220]   the leadership, right doctrine.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.600]   They've been around all of that,
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.640]   and then they say, well, I'm not sure if I'm interested.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.280]   So when he says, when they fall away,
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.760]   it is impossible to renew them,
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.640]   meaning every opportunity that they had to repentance,
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.740]   they would not repent and they turned away,
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.040]   there is no other way.
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.180]   We have a tendency to think that if we preach
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.340]   the word of God and people are not responding,
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.860]   let's try something else.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.420]   Let's try rock climbing club, right?
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.940]   Let's try, you know, let's try some other thing.
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.420]   Maybe people will be more interested
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:20.980]   if we try a different method.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:25.220]   God has only given one thing to bear fruit,
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:26.700]   and it's the word of God.
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.300]   He says to preach it in season and out of season.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:36.740]   So he says the person, part of the soil that receives it
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.540]   and bears fruit to eternal life
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.940]   is the one who has been planted.
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.940]   Just like it says in Psalm chapter one, two, and three,
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.580]   it says he's like a, but his delight is in the law
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.020]   of the Lord, and in this law he meditates day and night.
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.380]   He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.860]   which yields its fruit in season,
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.180]   and its leaf does not wither,
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:57.940]   and in whatever he does, he prospers.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.220]   He's not somebody that is constantly dependent
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.100]   on his circumstance.
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:05.180]   Somebody who hears the word of God superficially
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.580]   is constantly dependent upon the people
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:09.860]   and the circumstance that they're around.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.140]   So if they happen to be around, very encouraging,
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.620]   they're always chasing after you.
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:14.460]   How are you doing?
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:15.280]   What's going on?
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.120]   Did you read your Bible?
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:16.940]   How come you didn't pray?
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:17.780]   Come out with us.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:21.420]   And if you're not constantly being pursued, you wither.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:24.300]   Whether you've been a Christian for a year,
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:28.340]   or 10 years, or 20 years, because you're not planted.
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:32.860]   Your feeding is dependent upon others.
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:35.500]   So you're just enjoying the fruit of other people.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:39.180]   But you yourself are not planted.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.580]   So you need to constantly have somebody.
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:44.380]   And as soon as that person, or that circumstance,
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:47.340]   disappears, you completely wither.
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:49.740]   You know, I've mentioned this before,
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:52.420]   but all the bushes on the side of this building,
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.420]   we never water, right?
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:55.260]   We never water.
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:56.700]   We got rid of all the outside watering
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.740]   'cause we got so tired of our pipes breaking,
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.940]   and water leaking, and one day, you know,
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:04.260]   our water bill is like four times what it should be.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.620]   And so almost three, four times a year,
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.460]   we have to go and fix it.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:08.780]   So let's get rid of all these pipes,
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.300]   and we're just gonna put fake stuff in, right?
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.860]   So we expected all the bushes on the side
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.420]   to eventually wither, and then we're gonna pull it out,
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:17.840]   and we're gonna put fake grass in, right?
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.100]   That was our plan, but they never died.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.620]   It's been like four, five years,
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:25.460]   and they're still thriving.
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.180]   When you go out there, it's all green,
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.980]   and we never water that thing.
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.200]   It has found the living water.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.260]   Somewhere underground, it has attached itself
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:39.380]   to living water, and so even though we don't do it,
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:41.740]   right, it never dies, right?
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.180]   I mean, their fruit is green leaves,
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.180]   not a fruit tree, obviously.
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.380]   But he says a man, or a person,
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.700]   who hears the word of God, and he keeps it,
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.580]   is like a man who's planted in Christ.
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.580]   So, of course, being around other people
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.940]   that is encouraging circumstances
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.040]   may encourage us or discourage us,
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.300]   but he will never wither.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:06.620]   Because the true feeding is coming from Christ and his word.
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.740]   And they can't, nobody, no matter what circumstance,
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:11.040]   no matter what trials you go through,
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.980]   they can never take that away from you.
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:17.840]   Fourthly, which is the only one that I'm gonna go through,
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.580]   and then the perseverance we're gonna go through next week.
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:21.980]   Okay, I wanna give plenty of time
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.740]   for perseverance of the saints next week.
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.620]   They bore fruit, right?
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.380]   We talked about this in the beginning.
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:30.820]   The Bible makes it very clear.
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.620]   It said you will know them by what?
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.100]   Their profession?
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:34.940]   No.
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:38.300]   You will know them by an act that they did?
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.140]   No.
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:40.180]   You will know them by their baptism?
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:41.500]   No.
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:42.340]   What did he say?
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:44.320]   You will know them by their fruit.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.300]   By their fruit.
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.120]   In John 15, eight, it says my father is glorified by this,
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.300]   that you bear much fruit.
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:58.200]   And so prove to be my disciples.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.820]   What is the proof of genuine faith?
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:05.020]   He says much fruit.
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.260]   Much fruit, it's coming from the Bible.
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:11.540]   It's what you can observe.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.700]   That's why when Paul sends his disciples
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:16.760]   to Thessalonica or Corinth or somewhere else,
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:17.940]   they come back and they say,
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.940]   they started reporting about their faith.
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:24.960]   Were they in a room and they professed like,
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:25.920]   oh, this is what I believe,
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.640]   and they signed a doctrinal statement,
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.680]   and that's why he was coming reporting out.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.640]   Oh, they had great faith
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.860]   because they signed this doctrinal statement?
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.640]   No, they were observing their life.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.120]   They were observing their life.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.320]   They were observing the love
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.800]   that they had toward one another,
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.760]   and that was evidence of genuine repentance,
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.160]   genuine conversion.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.280]   He said you will know them by their faith,
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.280]   by the fruit as proof of my disciple.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:59.780]   If the fall of mankind is described in the Book of Romans
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.540]   that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:06.800]   what brings the greatest glory when we are restored?
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.540]   Not how loud we sing, right?
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.420]   That may be the fruit.
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:16.220]   That may be as a result of what's happening inside of you,
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:17.700]   when you go to church and doing all this.
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.180]   Yeah, all this stuff is good,
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.180]   but at the end, it's the fruit.
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.460]   It's who you are.
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:26.320]   In fact, one of the greatest hindrance
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:30.300]   to the gospel ministry is the church
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.660]   that worships God with its mouth,
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.280]   but they see hypocrisy.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.980]   Like, you come to church and you're raising your hands
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.620]   and you're singing loud to the Lord,
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:41.260]   but as soon as the service is over,
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.900]   they don't see any difference between you and the world.
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.540]   And the people who notice that more than anybody else
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.140]   are the non-Christians.
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:52.820]   You serve God with your lips,
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.820]   but your life is no different than mine,
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:59.740]   and then you're telling me that I need to repent?
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:01.280]   I don't think you repented.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:08.500]   He says, "Bearing fruit is the evidence," right?
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.020]   But let me say a couple things about this bearing fruit
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:13.740]   that we need to, that I wanted to take some time in,
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:15.820]   and again, the reason why I separated this
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:20.740]   from the last point, because I don't wanna rush through this.
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:24.300]   First of all, you cannot bear fruit,
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:30.120]   at least not spiritual fruit, if you're a goat.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:36.260]   You cannot disciple a goat to be a sheep, right?
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.260]   And the confusion that we made in the church is,
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:42.860]   we have opened the door for all the wheat,
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.340]   the tares, the goats, and the sheep to come in,
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.580]   and then we're asking the church, as soon as they say,
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.480]   you know, I'm a member of this church, to act like sheep.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.660]   But that was not the criteria
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:55.820]   to the entrance to the church.
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:59.760]   The church membership was open to anybody and everybody.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.020]   Who are we to judge anybody if they say they're a Christian?
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.540]   And so all kinds of people kept coming to the church,
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:07.980]   and then now we're expecting you to act like a sheep,
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:10.860]   and pastors are so frustrated.
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:12.140]   Why isn't my church doing this?
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:13.860]   How come my church isn't stepping up?
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.100]   Well, you're telling goats to act like sheep.
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:20.060]   You can't take a church filled with people
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.320]   who've never repented, and then expect them
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.980]   to act like they've repented.
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:31.460]   You can't disciple people who've never truly repented.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.100]   In Matthew 7, 17 to 20, it says,
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.460]   "So every good tree bears good fruit,
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:37.340]   "but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.240]   "A good tree cannot produce bad fruit,
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.320]   "nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.320]   "Every tree that does not bear good fruit
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.000]   "is cut down and thrown into the fire,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.820]   "so then you will know them by their fruit."
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.380]   He says you cannot bear fruit.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.820]   So the first step when you come to the church,
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:55.420]   maybe even in this room, is ask yourself,
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:58.760]   did you genuinely repent?
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:02.120]   Did you genuinely repent?
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.380]   Or did you just raise your hands?
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:05.900]   Like, I'll give 'em a try.
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:06.740]   What have I got to lose?
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.060]   I don't wanna go to hell.
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.340]   But did you genuinely repent?
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.120]   Were you actually convicted?
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.580]   Were you planted?
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:22.660]   You cannot disciple a bad tree to bear good fruit.
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:27.320]   There must be a born-again experience.
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:32.940]   That's why the clear preaching of the gospel,
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:35.880]   the entrance to the kingdom is repentance,
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:39.120]   not acceptance, is repentance.
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:45.180]   You cannot, you cannot love the world and love God.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:51.960]   That's not a principle of brain community church.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.960]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:59.960]   You cannot serve mammon and God, cannot.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:06.700]   You cannot be a bad tree and expect to bear good fruit.
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.540]   You must repent.
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:13.900]   That's why Jesus' call to the church,
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.600]   call to his kingdom, is repent,
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.220]   for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.940]   Repent.
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.820]   So the first question we need to ask ourselves,
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:23.880]   did you ever repent?
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.180]   I'm not asking did you become a member of the church.
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:29.540]   I'm not asking if you ever served the church.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:32.260]   Did you ever really repent?
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.180]   And remember what David said last week?
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.420]   He wasn't repenting about an act.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:39.700]   Like I did, yeah, I did that.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.660]   When I was young, I used to do this and I used to do that,
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:43.020]   and I shouldn't have said that.
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:46.820]   He was repenting about who he is, his core nature,
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:49.120]   even before he was born, he says.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:52.840]   Have you ever genuinely repented?
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:55.180]   That your old way of thinking, that your pursuit,
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.380]   your joy, your happiness, your life,
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:00.980]   realized that you are in sin and rebellion against God,
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.540]   and you surrendered, you repent,
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:05.220]   and you surrendered your life to Christ.
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.120]   Did you ever really repent?
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:12.600]   Secondly, to bear fruit, you must have the Holy Spirit.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:17.180]   Obviously, this is intertwined.
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:21.320]   That's why Jesus says to Nicodemus,
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.560]   here's a man on paper,
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.960]   did everything that a good Christian was supposed to do.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.980]   He memorized scripture as a Pharisee.
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.560]   He fasted.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.260]   He even proselytized.
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:36.240]   He gave more than most people.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.240]   And so he climbed this religious ladder,
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.300]   and Jesus says, you must be born again.
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.360]   He was born of the Spirit, is from the Spirit.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.840]   He was born of the flesh, is from the flesh.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:49.060]   He says, you must be born again of the Spirit.
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.840]   The difference between a Christian and a non-Christian
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.500]   is the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
[00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:59.320]   The difference between a Christian and a non-Christian
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.840]   of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:03.800]   is you can do the exact same work
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.160]   with the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.600]   and without the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.640]   and it produces exactly the opposite.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.240]   A person who is working and laboring
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.680]   without the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.420]   almost always ends in bitterness and burnout.
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:20.640]   'Cause you've done it with all your work.
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.960]   You've sacrificed so much.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.960]   You've done so much for other people,
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.520]   and they don't appreciate me.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.200]   And it didn't produce what I wanted.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:33.600]   It's like buying a Lamborghini with no gas.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.440]   It's just nice to look at.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.440]   And every time you get in that car,
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.480]   you literally have to burn yourself out to move.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:44.000]   In fact, it's harder to move with that car
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.440]   'cause you gotta drag that car with you.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.020]   And so many people who have come into the church
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:50.960]   who have never genuinely repented
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.660]   and does not have the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:56.800]   everything that the Bible tells you to do
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.040]   is just more burden.
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.080]   Aren't you already burdened with life?
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:05.120]   Isn't it hard paying your bills and taking care of kids?
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.080]   Isn't it already hard?
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.720]   And then you come to church and you gotta serve.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.240]   You gotta give.
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.080]   You gotta sacrifice.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.160]   You gotta talk to strangers.
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:14.800]   You gotta make friends with people
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.040]   that you don't even like.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:19.960]   And so every time an imperative is taught,
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:20.800]   a legalism.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.600]   Because you don't feel life in righteousness.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.400]   You're just burdened by righteousness.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.320]   Because you don't have the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.080]   When the disciples were ready to do the work,
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:38.440]   Jesus said, "Don't go yet because you will receive power
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.340]   "when the Holy Spirit comes upon you.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:45.280]   "And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.660]   "Judea, Samaria, to the remotest part of the world."
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:50.560]   So somebody who is trying to be righteous and good
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:52.720]   and religious without the power of Christ
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.720]   eventually gets burned out and become bitter.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:00.560]   But the difference when the Holy Spirit is upon you,
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.420]   you get to.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:04.440]   You get to worship God.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:07.080]   You get to pray.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.640]   You get to commune with him.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.020]   You get to go to heaven at the end of all of this.
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:15.240]   It says in Acts 8, 11,
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.500]   "But the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.340]   "dwells in you.
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:19.960]   "He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.160]   "will also give life to your mortal bodies
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.280]   "through his spirit who dwells in you."
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:27.760]   That same power, that resurrected Christ dwells in us.
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:31.900]   But without that power,
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:35.240]   all you've done is have a difficult life
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.140]   and added more things to do.
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:42.400]   You have things that you love to do you can't do
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.880]   because the church makes you feel guilty.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:48.280]   Or you're gonna do it, but then you feel judged.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:54.080]   There is a huge difference of what kind of fruit
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:58.200]   we bear when we are moved by the Holy Spirit
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.300]   versus moved by our flesh.
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:03.440]   Our churches are filled with people
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.800]   who are moved by their flesh,
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.880]   who are bitter and angry,
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:09.600]   serving the Lord, but bitter and angry and tired
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.560]   and constantly needing to take a break.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.840]   Again, there's nothing wrong with that,
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.180]   and I'm gonna talk about that later on.
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:19.680]   There's a right time for that.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:22.080]   But the church is filled with people
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:26.200]   who have been burned out because they are laboring
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.760]   without the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.120]   Now, when I say that you bear fruit
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.720]   according to the Spirit,
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:35.920]   our first instinct may be that we're gonna see
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.160]   more people come to Christ.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.480]   Maybe if you're a church planter,
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.760]   that church is gonna grow in number,
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.680]   and you're gonna be able to do more things.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.600]   But first and foremost, the fruit of the Spirit,
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:49.040]   evidence of the fruit of the Spirit is internal.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.780]   It's in who we are.
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.340]   In Galatians 5, 22, it says,
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:53.840]   but the fruit of the Spirit is what?
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.840]   Love, first, and it's not by accident
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.520]   that love is on the top.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.480]   'Cause Jesus said, they will know
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.080]   that you are my disciples
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.600]   if you have love for one another,
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.480]   as I have loved you.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.020]   You know why love is the first fruit?
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:11.100]   Not simply because it's the most important,
[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:13.840]   which it is, the Bible says so,
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.800]   but because the reason why you and I
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.900]   are a worshiper of Christ is because of his love.
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:22.160]   We love because he first loved us.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:25.800]   So when we recognize that he loved us,
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:28.900]   people who've been affected by the love of Christ,
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:30.500]   we become more loving.
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:35.560]   People who have been recipients of the greatest love
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.720]   are the ones who will be able to practice that love.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:39.640]   That's why the first sign
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:44.020]   that the Holy Spirit has made an indwelling in you,
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:46.200]   he says, is love.
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:52.340]   And then, you ever see people who are in love
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:53.240]   who are miserable?
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:55.620]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:56.780]   Maybe you're gonna find an example,
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:59:00.060]   but most people that I know who fell in love are happy.
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:02.240]   Right, and that's why I can tell.
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:04.360]   Even as I preach here, who just started dating,
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:05.720]   I can see it on your face.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.960]   Right?
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:11.240]   You have a silly smile that you can't get rid of, right?
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.320]   People who have been affected deeply
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:17.280]   by the love of Christ tends to be the most joyful, right?
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.960]   You ever see people who are laboring for God,
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:22.740]   but they're laboring so much, but they're so miserable.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:25.560]   They're so miserable.
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:28.080]   You know, they're working so hard,
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:29.740]   they're sacrificing so much,
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:31.480]   but every time you have a conversation with them,
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:32.780]   they're like, I don't like this, I don't like that,
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.480]   what's wrong with them, what's wrong with this?
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.680]   They're so miserable.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.960]   But the fruit of the Holy Spirit is love.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.980]   And then it's joy.
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:43.420]   And then it's peace.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.040]   You know why there's peace?
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:50.240]   Because when we meet Christ,
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:57.180]   the works-based righteousness in life is over, right?
[00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:00.000]   And then we become children again.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.240]   You know, many of us, most of us are old enough,
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:08.040]   if you were to think back, like, oh, I wish I was a child.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.280]   You know, whenever our kids complain,
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:15.040]   all you have to do is just wake up, have fun, you know?
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.680]   Eat, when it's time to eat,
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.840]   your mom has food ready on the table,
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.240]   and when they tell you to go to sleep, go to sleep,
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.200]   and then you wake up and you get to do it again.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.320]   And every day, the only concern that you have is like,
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.320]   what am I gonna fill my day today with?
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.700]   And all you need to be worried about is,
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.080]   what is my mom or dad telling me to do?
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.720]   You just need to follow their direction,
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.120]   and you're gonna live and thrive.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.920]   And then you wake up and do that again.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:42.860]   At some point in our life, we become independent,
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:44.600]   and we begin to work,
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.300]   and the responsibilities come on our shoulders.
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.960]   Are we gonna succeed, are we gonna fail?
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.080]   Are the investments that we made,
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.040]   are they gonna prosper?
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:53.880]   What is my life gonna,
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.280]   that's why you get midlife crisis,
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.240]   because all the things that you sacrifice in labor,
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.400]   you're measuring when you're in midlife crisis.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.600]   Did I succeed or did I fail?
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.580]   And so, people get into this depression because of that.
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.100]   But when you meet Christ,
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:12.640]   and the Holy Spirit comes upon you,
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.460]   and makes an indwelling in you,
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:16.060]   we become children again.
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:20.840]   All you need to do is do what he tells you to do.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.280]   He tells you to speak, you speak.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.460]   Tell you to lie down, just lie down.
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:27.400]   He tells you to rest, go rest.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.000]   Wake up, go wake up.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   You don't have to worry about what this is going to lead to,
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.280]   like a child, right?
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.480]   A child doesn't say, "Hey, eat this."
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.560]   Like, well, if I eat this, is it really good for my health?
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.920]   Am I gonna gain weight if I eat this, you know?
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:45.320]   Is this gonna cause future problems if I do this?
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.600]   The child doesn't worry about that.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.560]   If my mom told me to do it, right?
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:53.080]   She, what she is telling me, I just trust.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.080]   I'm just gonna do, right?
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.280]   That's exactly what the Bible tells us to do.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.480]   The Holy Spirit has been given to us as a deposit,
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.480]   guaranteeing our salvation.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:07.200]   So, everything that God tells us to do is good for us,
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.160]   even when it seems to be bad.
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.760]   It's good for us.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.920]   So, the fruit of the Holy Spirit is love, joy, peace.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.560]   And then, when you have that peace, you can be patient,
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:20.460]   because you're not the one in control.
[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:23.400]   No matter what your circumstance is,
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.280]   you're not the one in control.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.180]   So, if you've let go, and God is the one who's in control,
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:31.480]   I can be patient because I can't control this anyway.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:32.320]   It's up to God.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.140]   All I have to worry about is,
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.440]   did I do what God told me to do,
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.600]   and then let God do whatever he's gonna do?
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.220]   So, you become a lot more patient.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.160]   And joyful, loving, peaceful, patient people
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.520]   tend to be kind.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:50.240]   Kindness, and goodness, and faithfulness,
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.920]   and gentleness, and self-control are fruits
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.780]   when the Holy Spirit is making an indwelling in you.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:03.520]   Third, and finally, the fruits are varied.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:09.320]   In the Gospel of Mark, it says
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:13.400]   that the fruit you will bear will be 30, 60, or 100-fold.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.640]   They're different.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.360]   So, is it 30, 60, or 100?
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.480]   He said, no, it looks different.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.560]   Some people will bear 30,
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.640]   and some periods of life, you will bear 30 or 100.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:31.000]   I remember early on at church, it was not in season.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.180]   I already got burnt out of ministry.
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.720]   I tried everything, fasting.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.000]   I even shaved my head one time,
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.800]   saying I'm not gonna grow my hair until revival comes.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.560]   Obviously, my hair grew back.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.480]   Revival didn't come, and I fasted, and I prayed.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.280]   It's in season, bring revival, bring revival.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:56.860]   Early on in church, I was so burnt out from ministry,
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:00.760]   and I said, well, if we're gonna start this church,
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.880]   I'm just gonna follow what the Bible said,
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.120]   which is what I should've done to begin with.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.120]   I'm just gonna do whatever it says.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.240]   Whatever the Bible says,
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.680]   this is what we're gonna do our best to practice.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.440]   But it was just not in season.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.720]   People are here, it's like, ah, it's so boring.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.880]   Just always like, it's going over their head.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.560]   It's just always, he was talking about the Bible,
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.480]   and we don't have activities,
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.240]   and seeker-friendly movements were blowing up,
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.880]   and they're growing like crazy,
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.000]   and then they come to our churches.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.040]   Like, you're a Calvinist?
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.400]   You believe in the sovereignty of God and predestination?
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.200]   And people wouldn't come for that reason.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.040]   But all of a sudden, six, seven years into it,
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.240]   people are looking for churches
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.240]   that are preaching Reformed theology.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.960]   And nothing we did changed.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.840]   If you've been at our church for 20-plus years,
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.320]   you know my sermons haven't changed.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.160]   Ask any of them.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.840]   Nothing has changed.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.400]   But why are we bearing fruit now,
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.920]   and what didn't bear fruit in the early part of ministry?
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.200]   It just was not in season, right?
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.240]   In God's timing.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.520]   That's what it says.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.400]   He's like a tree planted by the river,
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.080]   and in season, he says.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.240]   And so Paul tells Timothy,
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.360]   preach the word in season and out of season.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.960]   The problem that we get into
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.120]   is we try to bear fruit at all season.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.800]   At all season.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.080]   God's word is not bearing fruit.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.680]   People are not interested in Christ,
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.440]   but we need to get them to church.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.560]   So even though they're not interested in Christ,
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.800]   we need to somehow get them interested in the church.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.440]   And so we change the teaching.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.360]   We change the preaching.
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.080]   We change the culture of the church
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.560]   so that we can bear fruit at all season,
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.600]   and that's why we get into this problem.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.120]   If the preaching of the word of God does not bear fruit,
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.720]   you shouldn't be bearing fruit.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.080]   It's not season.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.160]   I think right now, it's strawberry season.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.680]   We have some people who are very generous.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.640]   I've eaten more strawberries in the last month
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.440]   than I've ever, I don't think ever.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.760]   If I cough, I think strawberry's
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.200]   gonna be coming out of my mouth.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.520]   And it's been very sweet, right?
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:04.040]   But I don't know when strawberry season is,
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:07.200]   but it looks, it tastes like it's strawberry season.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.560]   But this season's gonna pass, right?
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.200]   And then there's a season for something else, right?
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:18.400]   So fruit doesn't look the same every season in life.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.160]   Some of you will bear a lot of fruit during college time,
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.200]   and then you'll go through some dry periods in your life,
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.080]   so we don't judge people based upon
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.480]   a particular event in your life.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.840]   It's just in season and out of season.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.000]   So just as there is season and in season
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.160]   in totality of generation,
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:36.000]   there are seasons and in seasons even in your life.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.720]   There are periods when it is harder for you,
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.720]   especially young parents with small children at home.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.160]   And you're frustrated because
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.960]   you can't do what you used to do.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:51.920]   But the size of the fruit will depend on the season.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:58.520]   Secondly, how you cultivate the fruit matters.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:04.040]   You know, Calvinists and Reformed people have a tendency
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.360]   to use Calvinism as an excuse to be passive.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.680]   You know, that if we labor hard,
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:10.960]   if we do disciple-making,
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.440]   and we're gonna go preach the gospel,
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.240]   and say, ah, you don't trust the sovereignty of God,
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.680]   it's gonna do whatever he wants to.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.560]   Apostle Paul is the one.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.920]   He says, "I endure all things," for who?
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.200]   "For the sake of the elect."
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.800]   He's the one who teaches about predestination and election,
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.960]   but he works harder than anybody else.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:33.640]   So does it matter, does it make a difference
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:36.560]   between those who pray hard and those who don't?
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.720]   Of course it does.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.120]   Is there a big difference between somebody
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.680]   who is in the Word of God daily
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.800]   versus somebody who's not?
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.800]   Of course it does.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.040]   How you cultivate your life will determine.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.600]   You will bear fruit if you are a genuine Christian,
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.120]   but the quality of the fruit, the amount of fruit,
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.840]   does matter in the way we cultivate.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:57.840]   Galatians 6:8, it said,
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.680]   "For the one who sows to his own flesh
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.840]   "will from the flesh reap corruption,
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.440]   "but the one who sows to the Spirit
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.280]   "will from the Spirit reap eternal life."
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:11.480]   If you invest in the things that are spiritual,
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.000]   you will see fruit that are spiritual.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.360]   If you give in to the things that are fleshly,
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:18.520]   you will bear fruit that are fleshly.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:22.000]   And let me tell you, this is not 100%.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.120]   If you have a grumbling spirit,
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.120]   you probably notice grumbling around you a lot more.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.800]   You say, "Why are these people always so negative?"
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.160]   And you don't realize that that's a fruit coming from you.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:41.720]   And again, I'm not saying 100%,
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.800]   but if you happen to be somebody
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.120]   who is cold and distant from people,
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.040]   all of us, you notice that with everybody.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.640]   Everybody's so cold and distant.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:54.520]   You don't realize that that's the fruit that you're bearing
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:58.440]   'cause they see that in you, and they're just reciprocating.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:04.000]   So much of the fruit, our circumstance, is created by you.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.280]   You ever see joyful people?
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.400]   They think everybody's joyful.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.400]   It's weird when other people complain to them.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.840]   They're like, "Huh, what?"
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.720]   That's shocking that they think that way.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.760]   Joyful people tend to bear fruit everywhere they go.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.640]   They're joyful.
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.120]   And again, let me qualify.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.920]   I'm not saying 100% is like that,
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.760]   but so much of what we see around us,
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:31.000]   the circumstances of people, how you get treated,
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   is a fruit, fruit of you cultivating your flesh.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.240]   You're giving in to certain thoughts and certain emotions.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.760]   And other people are treating you
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.960]   the way they think you're treating them.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:50.200]   Fruit, cultivation matters.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.640]   It's like Philippians 4, 12-13.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.360]   It says, "I know how to get along with humble means.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.400]   "I also know how to live in prosperity
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.520]   "in any and every circumstance.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.440]   "I have learned the secret of being filled
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.320]   "and going hungry, both of having abundance
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.760]   "and suffering need.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.840]   "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.480]   I've seen this verse on people's shoes,
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:14.080]   locker rooms, tags, and tattoos.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.320]   And then they would start by saying,
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.400]   "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.000]   And then it got shortened to, "I can do all things."
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.560]   Right?
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.360]   'Cause at the end of the day, that's what it really was.
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:28.280]   Right, it was Christ was an avenue
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.160]   to achieve greatness in their life,
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.720]   but it wasn't about Christ.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:37.920]   Paul says here, "I have learned the secret."
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.280]   I have learned.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.960]   It didn't come to him, he'd just wake up one day
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.280]   and then, he said he learned.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.280]   He learned the secret of being content, right?
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.520]   In poverty, in poverty.
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.520]   How much when things are going hard,
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:53.320]   it's like, "Man, only if circumstances change,
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.160]   "I can worship God.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.520]   "Only if circumstances change, I can praise God."
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.200]   He says, "No, I learned the secret even in poverty."
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.560]   Well, what's crazy here, he says,
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.400]   "I've learned the secret of being content
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.400]   "when he has much."
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.280]   Whoa, we all know how to do that.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.360]   Why did he have to learn?
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:13.640]   What was the secret about being content when you have a lot?
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:18.160]   Because his contentment wasn't from the riches.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.400]   The temptation that we have is,
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.960]   we know how to be content when we have much,
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.480]   but that's not what he's talking about.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:30.640]   He said the temptation of thinking that we are abundant
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.480]   because we have abundant in resources
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.400]   is a trap and a temptation that will take you away from God.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.320]   His secret of being content is learning to find Christ
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.860]   whether you are rich or whether you are poor.
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:46.960]   Your contentment does not come from your circumstance
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.800]   or the people around you,
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.320]   but your deep-rooted relationship with Christ.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.560]   And he said he had to learn that.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.360]   God had to put him through poverty.
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.280]   And even when riches were coming his way,
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.640]   he had to learn that.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:04.240]   Hebrews chapter 12, verses one to four says,
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.260]   "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:08.280]   "surrounding us, let us also lay aside
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:12.840]   "every encumbrance and sin which so easily entangles us."
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:18.320]   If you're in the habit of giving into your flesh,
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.280]   you are bearing fruit with that.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.000]   And we have a tendency, especially in our culture,
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.120]   anything that's difficult, we just change our theology.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.160]   God doesn't expect perfection.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.580]   God loves us just the way we are.
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.880]   And so we begin to preach and teach
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.960]   that sinners may remain sinners
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:43.000]   and be perfectly content that one day,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.080]   that when Christ comes,
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.120]   that he's just gonna take us into heaven.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.720]   Now, there's portions of that that are true,
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:54.440]   but the Bible also says they will know them by their fruit,
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.520]   that beginning of salvation is repentance
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:59.460]   and turning away from our sins.
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.280]   Look what he says.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:02.560]   He said, "Every encumbrance and every sin
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.760]   "that would so easily entangles us,
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.320]   "let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.060]   "You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:11.360]   "in your striving against sin."
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.660]   He doesn't say, "Well, it's so hard."
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.900]   And you know what our tendency is?
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:18.760]   We come to church and we share our struggles
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.000]   with other people and they say, "Yeah, me too."
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.880]   And then after a while, you start to think like,
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.920]   "Oh, this is normal."
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:29.040]   Christians struggle with purity.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:31.080]   And when they say struggle, you're not struggling.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.140]   You've given in.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:35.920]   He says, "In your striving against sin,
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.960]   "you have not shed blood."
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.840]   In other words, you've given in too easily.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.560]   You've accepted a sinful life, a rebellious life,
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.240]   an unrepentant life too easily.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:51.400]   You have made rebellion against God
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.120]   an acceptable place to be.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.600]   He said, "Against sin, you have not shed your blood."
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.740]   In other words, what he's saying,
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:01.320]   there will never be a time when a holy, holy, holy God
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.920]   is okay with your sin.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:05.840]   Does he forgive us?
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:06.660]   Yes.
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:07.500]   Is he patient?
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.340]   Yes.
[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:10.720]   But he calls us to repentance.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:13.540]   Repentance isn't feeling bad.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.740]   Repentance just isn't how you feel.
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.520]   Repentance is turning away.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.820]   Don't say, "I feel bad about that,"
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.000]   and then go right back to it the next day.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.400]   That's not repentance.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.360]   In your struggle against sin, he says,
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.360]   "You have not shed blood."
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:29.660]   You've given in.
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:31.360]   You're not just struggling with sin.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.440]   You are living in sin at that point.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.940]   Does cultivating true fruit matter?
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.580]   Yes, it matters.
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:41.620]   Pursuing righteousness matters.
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.300]   It has consequences.
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:46.520]   Investing in the work of the Holy Spirit matters.
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:47.760]   Evangelizing matters.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.280]   Prayer matters.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:52.040]   Study of the word of God matters.
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.260]   Loving people matters.
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:58.760]   In 2 Corinthians 13, 4, it says,
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:03.260]   "For indeed, he was crucified because of our weakness, yet."
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:06.080]   Okay, I want you to hear that word, yet.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.240]   He was crucified because of our weakness,
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.200]   yet he lives because of the power of God.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:14.980]   For we also are weak in him, yet we will live with him
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:17.540]   because of the power of God directed toward you.
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:22.800]   We tend to embrace our weakness, our fallenness,
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.500]   and that's why Christ died for us, and he said, "Yet."
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:30.100]   Just as the power that resurrected Christ,
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.660]   that same power resides in us.
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.660]   That's why Paul says, "I can do all things
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:35.300]   "through him who strengthens me."
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:37.940]   I can do all things.
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:41.720]   If somehow you've been lied to and convinced
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.340]   that you cannot, that's a lie.
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:47.260]   That's unbiblical.
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:51.120]   We may not achieve perfection,
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:55.260]   but God desires and expects us to pursue righteousness
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:59.800]   with all our heart because much fruit comes from
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:03.660]   cultivating and pursuing righteousness.
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:07.420]   We have made it too comfortable to be in sin in church.
[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:12.340]   We have made it too easy to give up in the church
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:16.760]   because nobody wants to be labeled a legalist,
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:19.400]   and that's one of the worst things you wanna hear, legalist.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.780]   Legalist in the church is like calling somebody racist
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:22.620]   in the world.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:26.920]   They bend in over backwards to prove they're not racist,
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.620]   and the church is bending over backwards
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:31.560]   to prove we're not legalists.
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:37.700]   Any pursuit of righteousness is legalist.
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.020]   I want you to lay down legalist
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:40.220]   that you don't need to pursue it.
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:42.220]   Read the scriptures.
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:44.240]   Read the scriptures carefully.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:47.260]   God has given us everything that we need
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:49.880]   for a life of godliness in the knowledge of his son,
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:53.420]   Jesus Christ, everything that we need.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:17:00.160]   Thirdly, and next two points, let me make it quick.
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:05.140]   Thirdly, we need to learn how to rest.
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:08.220]   We need to learn how to rest.
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:13.220]   God said not to plant every seventh year,
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:15.560]   to give the land rest.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.180]   Those of you who are a little bit older,
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:23.060]   I think everybody I talk to I think is in agreement
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:25.340]   that the fruit that we taste today is not as good
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:28.580]   as 40 years ago or 50 years ago when we were younger,
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:31.060]   and I don't think it's because our taste buds are dying.
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:32.660]   That's part of it, right?
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:37.060]   I think that it's being over-cultivated,
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:41.180]   and that's why when Israel refused to observe the Sabbath,
[01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:43.900]   the seventh day rest for the land,
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:45.980]   he put them into judgment,
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:49.420]   and God forced Sabbath on the land.
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:53.080]   There's a tendency where people are,
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.300]   because they made bearing fruit,
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:58.740]   bearing fruit and idol in their life,
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.820]   that they don't know how to rest.
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:04.020]   And so the church is really good at creating Marthas.
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:08.540]   Because you get praise if you're a Martha in the church.
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:09.900]   You're working hard, you're serving,
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:11.340]   you're sacrificing more than anybody else,
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:15.220]   and so if you're working hard, more work, right?
[01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:16.620]   Because the harvest is plentiful.
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:18.420]   Workers are few, so if you're working hard,
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:20.580]   more work on you, and if more work's coming in,
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:22.140]   then more work comes, 'cause the harvest,
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:24.860]   the need will never be lesser
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:26.180]   than the people who are working.
[01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:28.740]   So the working people tend to be worked to the ground,
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:31.260]   and we don't know how to rest.
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:34.140]   The rest is necessary,
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:36.220]   not simply because we need to recuperate,
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:41.740]   but because we trust in Christ.
[01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:44.540]   Resting is also part of God's plan.
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:47.940]   And not resting is not trusting God.
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:48.780]   What if I rest?
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:49.600]   What if this happens?
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.380]   What if it falls apart?
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:52.220]   What if people do this?
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:53.540]   What if people do that?
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:56.100]   If I don't work, that's also an idol.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:00.060]   So in order to cultivate true fruit,
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:03.860]   there are periods when we need to learn to rest
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:05.460]   and to trust God.
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:06.300]   I just need to obey.
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:08.020]   I'm just gonna do whatever he tells me to do.
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:10.140]   If he tells me to go, I'm gonna go.
[01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:11.580]   If he tells me to speak, I'm gonna speak.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:15.160]   If he tells me to go to sleep, go to sleep.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.100]   You need that.
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:23.180]   And then finally, God has apportioned faith
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:25.540]   to different levels, to different people.
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:26.900]   He says, "For through the grace given me,
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:27.980]   "I say to everyone among you,
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:30.320]   "not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think,
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.540]   "but to think so as to have sound judgment,
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:36.660]   "as God has allowed it to each measure of faith."
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:38.260]   Notice that?
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:41.180]   Even faith was given to us in different measures
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.980]   in the church.
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:44.800]   Now, everybody has faith
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.120]   if you're a genuine believer in Christ.
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:47.900]   Everybody repented,
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:50.100]   but he says he has given different measures of faith.
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:52.100]   Not everybody was called to be an apostle.
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:54.660]   Not everybody was called to be a martyr.
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:57.460]   But we have a tendency to think,
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.320]   especially if you're like a type A personality like me,
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:04.400]   you know, I remember early on in ministry,
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.580]   like I was determined to create
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:10.820]   the green berets of Christianity, right?
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:13.060]   And so I didn't have patience for people
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.180]   who weren't running at my pace.
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:18.660]   And one of the people that wasn't running at my pace
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:21.740]   was my own wife, you know?
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:25.680]   Because I was gonna have homeless people in my house.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:28.500]   I was gonna go to the hardest place in the world,
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.680]   and I was gonna evangelize,
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:32.120]   and if God calls me to die early, I'm gonna die early.
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.780]   I mean, I was gonna burn out for Jesus,
[01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:35.780]   and I thought that that was it.
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:37.180]   And anybody who wasn't following me,
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:39.720]   it's like, "It's 'cause you don't love Jesus.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.340]   "You don't love Jesus."
[01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:44.020]   And every time I would share my frustration with my wife,
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.500]   she would say, "Not everybody's like you."
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.780]   My response was, "Why not?
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:50.900]   "I don't get it."
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:53.480]   But as time went by,
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:56.500]   and the more I understood the scripture,
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.000]   the beauty of the church is he's filled the church
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.760]   with different gifts, people running at different pace.
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:06.000]   And so early on in ministry,
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.640]   I wanted a church filled with Navy SEALs, right?
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.080]   Green berets.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:13.000]   And if you're a Navy SEAL or green beret, right?
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.500]   I don't have patience for you.
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:19.280]   But as time went by, I realized how much of that
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:22.900]   was in my youth, and how much of that was my pride.
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.600]   Now, that sounds good.
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:28.640]   If you're a green beret pursuer like me, right?
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.980]   And it's like, "Yeah, what's wrong with that?"
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.260]   Right?
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.080]   If we're being shot at,
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.760]   and I'm going in for a very specific task, right?
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:40.440]   Green beret is useful, right?
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.000]   But green berets at a dinner party,
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.440]   they might not be the people that you want, right?
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:49.800]   Imagine running your family with that mentality.
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:54.020]   This son got straight A's, this one got a B minus.
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:55.900]   I can't tolerate this, right?
[01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:59.700]   If you have one son who's running 100 miles per hour,
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:02.140]   another one's running at 50 miles per hour,
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:04.300]   what do you do as a parent?
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:06.500]   'Cause you gotta teach the ones that's running faster
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:07.960]   to slow down for the brother.
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:11.900]   To make sure that we're all going together.
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:15.540]   And so there are things that that guy needs to learn.
[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.580]   You need to learn to be patient.
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:19.340]   You need to learn to be gracious.
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:20.560]   And you have this person,
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:23.480]   the person who tends to move a little bit slower,
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.680]   tends to be more patient.
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.240]   That's why they are the way they are.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:29.560]   It just doesn't bother them, right?
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:31.040]   Like, again, I have a personality.
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:33.840]   If I'm gonna go somewhere, I can't rest in the process.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.800]   You know, people always say like,
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.120]   "You gotta enjoy the process."
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.600]   It's like, "Yeah, I'll enjoy the process after I'm done."
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:40.440]   You know what I mean?
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:42.160]   And then I'll look back and enjoy the process,
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.760]   but I'm not gonna enjoy it while I'm getting there.
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:45.920]   I gotta get there as fast as I can, right?
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:49.280]   But I realize in God's wisdom,
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.480]   he has placed the church,
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.800]   and do some Christians struggle with certain things?
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.480]   Of course we do.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:56.780]   Are there periods when we're like,
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:58.000]   "How come I'm not bearing fruit?"
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.800]   Of course we do.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.560]   Are there periods of time when it seems harder
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.400]   than other times?
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.220]   Of course we do.
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.060]   Genuine Christians.
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:07.440]   That's why sometimes it's hard to distinguish
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.160]   between the third and the fourth soil.
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.200]   The church is filled with that.
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.360]   But the people who are running 100 miles per hour
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:16.600]   learn to humble themselves and be gracious and be patient.
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.600]   So that your brothers and sisters in Christ
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:21.860]   can come along with you.
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:25.200]   And the ones who are going slower
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.600]   need to benefit from the people who are running faster.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.960]   To admire them and to be attached to them
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.720]   and to benefit from the work that they're doing.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.120]   But our tendency is,
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.080]   if I'm bearing 60, you're bearing 30,
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:37.000]   somebody's bearing 100,
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.600]   we're all just pointing fingers at each other
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.000]   because they're not like me.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.200]   But in God's wisdom,
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.460]   he didn't just call us an army.
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:45.820]   We're a family of God.
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:48.540]   And because we're a family of God,
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:50.300]   every single person in this room
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:54.060]   has some weakness that they need to learn and to grow.
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:55.820]   And that's why it says,
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:24:00.820]   you will bear fruit by 30, 60, 100 fold.
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:06.140]   In season, cultivation, learning to rest,
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:09.020]   and knowing and accepting and loving people
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:11.140]   who are different than us.
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:13.180]   And that's the beauty of the church.
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:15.560]   Let's pray.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:17.000]   - Amen.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.400]   - Father, we pray that your word
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.860]   would continue to bear fruit,
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:27.880]   that you would help us, Lord God,
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.360]   to be planted, not just to taste it,
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.040]   not just to know it and regurgitate it,
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.940]   but to be planted by the living water.
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:38.760]   Help us, Lord God, to bear fruit,
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.960]   to bear much fruit for the sake of your kingdom
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.800]   and for your glory.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.800]   Guide us and lead us for the sake of your name.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.040]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
