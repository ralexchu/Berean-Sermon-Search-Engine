[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Hebrews chapter 3, I'm going to be reading from verse 1 through 6.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.160]   Hebrews chapter 3 verses 1 through 6.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.080]   Therefore holy brethren, partakers of heavenly calling, consider Jesus the apostle and high
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.200]   priest of our confession.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.320]   He was faithful to him who appointed him, as Moses also was in all his house.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.200]   For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses by just so much as the builder
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.160]   of the house has more honor than the house.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.200]   For every house is built by someone, but builder of all things is God.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.680]   Now Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.080]   which were to be spoken later.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.680]   For Christ was faithful as a son over his house, whose house we are, if we hold fast
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.200]   our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.840]   Let's pray.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.160]   Jesus father we thank you for the privilege that we have to come and worship you, to call
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.800]   you our Abba father.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.720]   We pray that your living word will continue to guide and lead us.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.440]   Our thoughts, emotions, all of it Lord God may be surrendered to your will.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.240]   We pray father that as we search your word, that it would search us.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.280]   And we pray father that what you have anointed through these words would have its effect
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.280]   on us this morning.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.240]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.240]   As you guys know, many of you know today is the graduation day for many of our students
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.080]   and graduation for this whole weekend.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.500]   So a lot of the parents were actually here this morning in the first service and they
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.760]   ended up going to the graduation afterwards.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.000]   And so whenever there is a transition in life, it causes us to contemplate and think what
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.880]   is coming next?
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.080]   What kind of job am I going to get?
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.080]   What's my future going to be like?
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.080]   Am I going to meet somebody?
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.680]   Am I going to get married in my 20s and my 30s?
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.280]   And anytime there is a transition, it forces us to think because it's going to dictate
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.600]   where we're going to be headed.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.160]   What the next stage of our life is going to look like.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.920]   Today is Father's Day.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.160]   And so I remember very distinctly the first time I thought about what kind of father I
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.160]   was going to be.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.160]   It was when I first got married.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.320]   In fact, it was even before I got married.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.400]   Knowing that I was going to get married and the Lord willing at some point that we're
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.120]   going to have kids, I invested in this video series from Hanna-Barbera.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.680]   Some of you guys may remember that.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.280]   I don't think they exist anymore.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.080]   But Hanna-Barbera came out with this video Bible series for children, cartoons.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.080]   And it was VHS.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.360]   I know some of you guys don't know what that is.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.960]   But it was made out of VHS and I thought it was fantastic.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.640]   It was like, you know, first time they made cartoon Bible pictures and all this stuff.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.480]   And so it cost us $700 and I think the video series may have about 20 videos.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.360]   And before I ever had kids, I purchased it.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.360]   Right.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.280]   Now you have to understand at that time my full time pay was under $1,000 before taxes.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.040]   I didn't have car insurance.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.920]   So it was a lot, a lot of money.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.360]   In fact, Esther was very surprised that I spent that kind of money on that.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.100]   And the reason why I did that is because I wanted to be a good father.
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.840]   And I thought if I had these video series that it would make it easier.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.280]   You know, I grew up watching Andy Griffith Show.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   Some of you guys may.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.960]   Yeah, most of you guys don't know.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.960]   OK.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.960]   Andy Griffith Show.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.320]   Basically, he was, in my view, the most ideal perfect father.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.600]   You know, he was a single dad.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.080]   The father, the mother passed away early.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.320]   And so if you remember, if you know that show, basically the dad has always had the perfect
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.480]   answer.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.140]   You know, when his son would go and get into trouble, he would come down and have a wise
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.040]   conversation and his whole paradigm would shift.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.280]   And, you know, he never loses his temper, always goes fishing with him.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.400]   And so it's really that it was about the father who was a cop, but so much of it was about
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.760]   a relationship between him and his son.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.880]   And I remember growing up watching that thinking, that's the dad, kind of dad I would like to
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.140]   be.
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.520]   And so I thought that was a good investment.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.800]   You know, so I purchased these video series, even though it was way out of my budget.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.760]   And we got married and it took us five years to have our first kid.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.720]   And so by the time we had our first kid, we thought, yes, you know, like Jeremy's going
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.480]   to be able to watch this and we're going to bond.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.760]   And then I didn't realize that it wasn't going to be until another three or four years later
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.160]   that he can actually watch it.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.280]   So from the time that I bought it until the time the kids can watch it, VHS was no longer
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.160]   working.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.680]   And what seems so fantastic eight, nine years ago was so outdated.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.560]   It was so cheesy.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.320]   You know, it was like they had DVD, you know, and internet and all these things came out.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.520]   So I probably didn't even open two thirds of it.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.160]   And SRI and I ended up watching some of it.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.920]   And I don't think our kids even knew what that was.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   Right.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.200]   It was obviously not a good investment.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.320]   It was a huge chunk of the money that we had at that time, all because I just thought that
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.160]   that would make me a good father.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.160]   Right.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.520]   The reason why I say that is because there are periods of life, especially as Father's
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.000]   Day, every single one of us.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.760]   I don't know any father who becomes a father thinking that I'm going to be a bad dad.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.760]   Right.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.760]   I'm going to fail as a father.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.000]   Nobody thinks that.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.560]   Everybody wants to be a good dad.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.280]   You know, when you get married, you start thinking, what kind of husband do I want to
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.280]   be?
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.280]   What kind of father do I want to be?
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.800]   And then as life goes by, challenges come.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.320]   You realize your limitation.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.720]   You realize that you're not raising perfect kids.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.680]   And in that context, you struggle and wrestle.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.640]   And then life kind of has a way of repeating itself.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.280]   When these transitional periods of life comes, we automatically contemplate and think what
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.200]   we value, who we want to be, what are we going to invest in.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.960]   Out of all the things that we contemplate and think about, there is no greater question
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.040]   than the question of who is Jesus?
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.720]   Now when I ask that question, I'm not asking about a theological question.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.760]   I'm not asking about what you learned.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.360]   I'm not asking about what verse to quote.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:32.840]   If you asked me that question before I became a Christian, I would have told you because
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.240]   of what I knew, because of being raised in a church, I would have told you that Jesus
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.620]   Christ is God.
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.960]   That He died for my sins.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.480]   He was resurrected on the third day.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.320]   That Jesus is the truth and the way and the life.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.640]   No one comes to the Father but through me.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.020]   Because I memorized those scriptures.
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.000]   I became a Christian in 1983.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.420]   If you asked me in 1982 what I believed about God, it was all Orthodox.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.420]   My dad was a pastor.
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.920]   My grandfather was a pastor.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.160]   I don't remember a single day missing church, ever.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.240]   It doesn't matter how sick you were.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.360]   We religiously attended church.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.060]   I went to all the VBS, Sunday school teachings.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:21.000]   So if you asked me in 1982, "Who is Jesus to you?"
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.800]   I would have been able to give you an Orthodox, a Biblical answer to who Jesus is.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.260]   But I wasn't a Christian.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.160]   I didn't know Christ until 1983, December.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.800]   What was the distinction?
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.120]   Jesus asked this very question to His disciples.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.120]   Who do men say that I am?
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.360]   And they gave all kinds of answers.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   He's Elijah.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   He's the prophet.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.240]   But Jesus was not concerned about what they were thinking.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.800]   He was asking them, "Who do you say I am?"
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.040]   And when He asked that question, He wasn't asking for only a theological answer.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.040]   He was asking Him.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.840]   He was asking the disciples.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:09.800]   In Matthew 16, 16, Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.640]   Who is Jesus to us?
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.300]   Who is Jesus to you?
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.960]   If we've been raised in a church, if you've been a Christian for a while, we know how
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.840]   to give the knee-jerk reaction.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.680]   You've been taught the theological answers.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.680]   You go to Bible study.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.600]   You know, I mean, again, if you've been a Christian for any period of time, even your
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:38.040]   children, because they were raised in the church, even at the age of 10, ask them, "Who
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.840]   is Jesus, Son of God?
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   What did He do?
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.840]   He died for us.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.980]   He was resurrected on the third day.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.160]   And so because of what He did, what's going to happen?
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.160]   We're not going to go to hell?
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.160]   We're going to go to heaven?"
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.080]   They can give you that answer.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.080]   But that's not what this text is asking us to consider.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.200]   The author of Hebrews is talking to a group of people who are beginning to drift away
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.280]   from the things of God and have taken their eyes off of Christ.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:12.240]   And so in chapter 3, verse 1, he says, "Holy brethren, particulars of the heavenly calling,
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.880]   consider Jesus."
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.160]   When he's asking to consider Jesus, it's the same question.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.480]   Who is Jesus to you?
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.820]   Who is Jesus to you?
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:28.200]   The word "consider," "kata no'eo," the word "kata" is an intensifying word.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.560]   The word "no'eo" means to think.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:37.600]   So literally, it means to think carefully, intensely, to observe carefully, to contemplate,
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:46.000]   to meditate, to ultimately marvel at, to take some time to consider deeply who is Jesus
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   to you.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.140]   Not who is Jesus, but who is Jesus to you?
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:56.700]   The text that we're looking at this morning is going to give us about four different reasons
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.280]   why we need to carefully consider Christ.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.560]   The number one reason—now I'm not going to spend too much time on this because the
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.400]   author has been spending the whole chapter and chapter 2 talking about this—he says,
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.920]   first one, we need to consider carefully who Jesus is because Jesus is the apostle and
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.680]   high priest of our confession.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.480]   He starts the first verse by saying, "Therefore, holy brethren," meaning, in conclusion to
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.160]   everything that he's been saying in chapter 2, "Therefore."
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.720]   And so at the end of chapter 2, he says, "For since he himself was tempted in that which
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.520]   he has suffered, he is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted."
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.920]   An apostle literally means a messenger, someone who was sent from God.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.680]   A high priest was an individual who mediated between the sinner and the holy God.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.600]   So he's been spending the whole chapter and chapter 2 discussing how Jesus is an apostle,
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.840]   but he's also the perfect mediator.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:00.600]   Now, that alone should cause us to think carefully.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.480]   If Jesus is the only way to get to God, and he is a sympathetic high priest, we should
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.880]   carefully consider.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.640]   He already mentioned that in chapter 2, so I'm not going to spend too much time on that.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.200]   But the second part of why we need to carefully consider and meditate about Christ is also
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.320]   in that first verse.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.960]   We need to carefully consider Christ because our calling is a heavenly calling in verse
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.960]   1.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.160]   "Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider Jesus."
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:37.920]   Again, the reason why he emphasizes to them about this holy calling, this heavenly calling,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:43.040]   is because the Jews that he is writing to were beginning to go drift back to their old
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.780]   life.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:48.480]   And the reason why they were drifting back to their old life was because their new life
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.120]   in Christ was beginning to become difficult.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.740]   At the very beginning when they converted, the author says later on that you joyfully
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.760]   participated with those who were having their possessions being taken.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.180]   You prayed for those and visited those who were put into prison because of their faith.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.340]   And there was an excitement.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.980]   Even in the midst of persecution, there was a great excitement.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.220]   But by the time this letter is written, it's about 30 or 40 years removed from when they
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.080]   first heard the gospel.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.520]   We have second, third generation Christians who are in this church.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.760]   And continuing on this path is difficult.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.640]   I mean, we can all relate to that.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:35.040]   It's one thing to experience trial, but it's another thing when the trial is constant.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.640]   And that was the problem that they had.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.280]   The reason why they were drifting back to their old life was because as a Jew, it was
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.880]   much easier to live as a Jew.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.600]   So they weren't outright denying Christ, they were just making some compromises so that
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.860]   their Christian life would be a little bit more easier.
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.460]   Maybe if they just adjusted a few things.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.360]   Maybe if they didn't say that Jesus Christ is Lord and he meant everything.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.220]   If you just kind of tweaked a little things.
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.560]   And the whole reason why this letter is being written is because they're drifting back to
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.840]   their old life.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:19.040]   The author is reminding them that Christ didn't come to make this life easier.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.160]   Christ didn't come to fix our financial problems.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.260]   He didn't come because we have family issues.
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.560]   He called us to a heavenly calling.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.600]   In Philippians 3.14, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.280]   in Christ Jesus, upward call of God.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.840]   Paul is writing this sitting in prison.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:47.560]   Now you have to, we have to realize if our mankind's whole pursuit of life is to get
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:53.940]   ahead, to seek happiness, new adventures, going to prison means death.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:59.160]   You may not physically die, but there's no opportunity to move ahead in prison.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.680]   There's no opportunity to seek joy in prison.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.800]   There's no opportunity to have family, have children, retirement.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:11.560]   So to be in prison, whether it was then or now, means death.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.680]   He's sitting in prison and he hasn't given up.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:20.720]   He said I am pressing on toward the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.120]   The reason why he's able to say that is because his goal was not this life.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:32.120]   Philippians 3.1-2, "Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ, keep seeking the
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.380]   things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:41.440]   Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth."
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:48.520]   If your baptism meant anything to you, if you truly have been crucified and resurrected
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.680]   to new life, he said the natural thing to do is to set our mind on the things where
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.160]   he's at, not here.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:03.200]   I think the problem that we have is we try so hard to bring Christ to our circumstance,
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.820]   make him fit into our life, and then we meet all kinds of frustration when he doesn't help.
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:14.120]   When the calling to begin with is to call us out of this life, later on, we're not there
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.680]   yet, but later on he's going to say, "As Christ went outside the gate, he calls us also to
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.160]   go outside the gate."
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.200]   He didn't say, "You know what?
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   You have a comfortable life.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.080]   Let me come and make it better."
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.960]   C.S. Lewis, in his book, "Mere Christianity," says this about this subject.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:37.040]   "If you read history, you will find that Christians who did most for the present world were just
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.740]   those who thought most of the next.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:44.080]   The apostles themselves who set on foot the conversion of Roman Empire, the great men
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.960]   who built up the Middle Ages, the English evangelicals who abolished the slave trade
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:53.920]   all left their mark on earth precisely because their minds were occupied with heaven.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.200]   It is since Christians have largely ceased to think of the other world that they have
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.240]   become so ineffective in this.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.160]   Aim at heaven and you will get earth thrown in.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.680]   Aim at earth and you will get neither."
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.240]   You know, the greatest thing that I learned, the greatest help that I have received being
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:19.240]   a Christian was that nothing in this world really matters.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:24.440]   This rat race, a wanting to have a certain kind of reputation, wanting to build something
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.240]   for the future, having a comfortable home for our children, all of these things, none
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.800]   of these things are sinful, but in the end it doesn't matter.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.000]   That whether you live a life with a lot of money in a bank account or whether you live
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.560]   a difficult life with very little in the bank account, whether you live a long life or a
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.460]   short life, it doesn't matter.
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:46.240]   It doesn't matter because everything is temporary.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.400]   Understanding that our call is an upward call in God, that no matter what you experience
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.720]   here, ultimately He's going to pluck us out of that to save us for eternity.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:02.040]   And that lesson, the greatest thing that I've gained from following Christ is that none
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.280]   of it ultimately matters.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.360]   So it doesn't destroy your life when things don't go the way that you planned, when you
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:15.120]   didn't make a lot of money, when you weren't successful in the eyes of the world.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.240]   None of that is sinful, but it just doesn't matter.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.340]   That's what He's reminding these Christians who are drifting back because they were having
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.640]   a difficult time.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.920]   Why is everybody else having an easy life, a comfortable life?
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.560]   They're able to have business and not feel guilty.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.560]   And so why not?
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.560]   Why can't we have that?
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.520]   And that's why they're drifting back and they're reminding them, don't forget your initial
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.760]   call.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.240]   It wasn't to make heaven on earth.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:47.760]   It was to remind us to the heavenly calling.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:53.440]   The third reason why we need to consider Christ carefully is that Jesus is better than Moses
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.280]   and deserving of more glory than Moses.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.840]   You and I hear that.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.000]   We know about Moses.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   We know who he is.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.040]   He was a great leader to the Israelites.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:11.480]   And so for us, when we hear that Jesus is greater than Moses, of course he is.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.480]   He's God.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.720]   Moses is just a human being.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.960]   It's not much of an argument.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.920]   We don't need convincing.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:23.120]   You have to understand who Moses is or was to the Israelites.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.240]   Remember the transfiguration when Jesus takes the three disciples up to the mountains and
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.520]   he wanted to show Jesus' glory?
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.640]   Who was there at the transfiguration?
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.720]   Moses and Elijah.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.360]   Moses was not just one of many leaders.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:48.960]   Moses was there in Jesus' glory standing and talking to Jesus.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.320]   He was not just an ordinary man who just happened to be a great leader.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:58.600]   Moses was the one that God used to deliver Israel from Egypt.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.360]   He was basically Abraham Lincoln and then some.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:10.200]   God demonstrated his power to confront the Egyptian gods through Moses.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:16.280]   He was the leader who stood between Israelites and God pleading that God would be merciful
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.480]   for the nation of Israel because God was so angry with their stiff-necked sin.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.840]   It was Moses.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.880]   It was his prayer that preserved the nation of Israel.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.080]   The law of God that the Pharisees were so proud of.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.500]   It came through Moses.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.960]   God revealed it to Moses and dictated and then he brought it to the people.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.200]   The tabernacle, the temple, all of these things that the Israelites treasured so much.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.160]   The initial tabernacle was given to Moses.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.920]   Everything that the Israelites valued was given through this man.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.280]   He was not just any ordinary man.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:59.880]   In fact, they esteemed him so highly, many of the Jewish rabbis actually said that Moses
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.560]   was higher than the angels.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.320]   Now we can see why people would think that because again at the transfiguration, it wasn't
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.840]   the angels talking to Jesus.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.280]   It was Moses and Elijah, the greatest prophet.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:20.160]   But of all the things that they knew about Moses, the greatest thing about Moses was
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.520]   that Moses had this intimate relationship with God that no other human being had.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.960]   It's expressed in Numbers chapter 12, 6 through 8.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.120]   He said, "Hear now my words.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.880]   If there is a prophet among you, I the Lord shall make myself known to him in a vision.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.880]   I shall speak with him in a dream.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.280]   Not so with my servant Moses.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.480]   He is faithful in all my household.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:48.240]   With him I speak mouth to mouth, even openly and not in dark sayings.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.600]   And he beholds the form of the Lord."
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:56.480]   In other words, Moses is closer to God than any other human being.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.960]   And that's the reason why they thought that Moses was greater.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.660]   Some of them thought he was greater than the angels.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:11.400]   So when they hear that Jesus is like Moses, they needed some convincing.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:16.720]   How can you say, "If Moses is the greatest human being that we know and Jesus is like
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.640]   him, what are you saying about Jesus?"
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.220]   But that wasn't his point.
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.240]   The point wasn't that Jesus is like Moses.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.880]   He goes even further than that.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.240]   He says Jesus is greater than Moses.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.680]   He deserves more glory than Moses.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.040]   Hebrews chapter 3, 5-6.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.840]   "Now Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.280]   which were to be spoken later.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.880]   But Christ was faithful as a son over his house whose house we are.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:48.760]   If we hold fast our confidence in the boast of our hope firm until the end."
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.800]   There's two things that we need to clarify here.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:58.280]   One, the word for servant that describes Moses is not doulos.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.880]   I know our college students, you know, you have your serving team called doulos.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.640]   What does doulos mean?
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.160]   A bond servant or more literally just slave.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.280]   Majority of the New Testament, when you hear the word servant, it's doulos, majority of
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.280]   it.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.800]   The word that is used here is not doulos, it's therapon.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:25.120]   And the word therapon also translated servant is only used in this text.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:30.240]   The reason why is that the word for servant here is unlike the word bond servant.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.040]   Bond servant is somebody who is obligated because of his position in life.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.400]   He may be an indentured servant or he may have been born a slave, but he's obligated
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.480]   by whatever the master tells him to do.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.960]   That is not the word used here.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:51.960]   The way the commentators describe this word, therapon, is not a subservient role.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:58.560]   And the illustration that they give is like a physician who serves his patient.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:04.800]   The physician is not the subservient role, but by serving, he is actually greater.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:10.960]   Moses is a servant of Israel, not because he is under them, but because he is over them.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.720]   And that's the word that is being used here.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:21.120]   So this is not to undermine Moses' dignity, he's actually elevating Moses, saying, "Moses
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.360]   served you, and he was a great man who was deserving of great honor.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:30.440]   So everything you know of Moses, it is true.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:37.680]   But Jesus comes as the Son, as great as Moses is."
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.480]   No one spoke to God face to face.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:45.040]   The Bible clearly says, "A sinful man who gets that close to God shall surely die."
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.840]   Every instance that we see holy men in the presence of God's glory, they bow down in
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:55.960]   terror, and yet God describes him as somebody that God speaks to mouth to mouth, face to
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.520]   face.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.940]   He is deserving of great honor.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.600]   God used him in a fantastic way.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:11.080]   But despite the honor that he deserves, he says, "He came to serve as a servant, yet
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.120]   Jesus Christ served as the Son."
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.840]   You notice here he says, "He was a house of servant for a testimony of those things
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.120]   which were to be spoken later."
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.920]   In other words, everything that Moses did, everything that God used him to do, was for
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.840]   what purpose?
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.120]   To set up for the testimony of what was to come.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.120]   What was that?
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.920]   Christ.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:42.880]   Everything that Moses did, as great as he is, as deserving of veneration as Moses deserved,
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.920]   all of that served as a testimony of the coming of the Son.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.920]   He served, but Jesus comes and he serves as the Son.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.960]   It's his own household.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.400]   The love that Christ has for us is so much deeper, so much greater than any other human
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.320]   being, even Moses.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.560]   That's the point that he's trying to make.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.720]   For the last 10 years, we lived in a rented house in Irvine.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:18.160]   Now, we got in 10 years ago and it was fair to undervalue.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.000]   Our rent was pretty cheap compared to what other people pay.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.560]   We were there for 10 years and the owner never raised rent.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.520]   Part of the reason why he never raised rent was because I never called him.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.240]   He said the previous tenant called him for everything.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.840]   He said door hinge or a little leak and he actually asked me, "Do you know how to fix
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.840]   the little things?"
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.560]   That was his number one question when he asked me.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.240]   I said, "I could do some of that stuff."
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.160]   Unless it was really bad, I never called him.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.520]   The garage door was constantly broken and all it needed was for me to yank something
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.720]   or tweak something and I would fix it and so he wouldn't have to come.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.640]   They liked us so they kept the rent that way for 10 years.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.840]   It was never raised.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.360]   Living in that house, I would have to fix a little hinge here or the door or the light
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.800]   bulbs or little electrical stuff.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.080]   I did most of that stuff.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:12.560]   But after 10 years, the gap between what the house was worth and where it was almost $1,000
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   difference.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.000]   The owner said, "We're going to raise rent and we're going to eventually get it up to
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.240]   the market value," and it didn't make sense for us to live and rent anymore.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.140]   We ended up purchasing the house behind us, literally behind us.
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:31.080]   It was the house that we looked for 10 years, looking into that neighbor and saying, "Oh,
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.800]   they're having a party there.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.200]   Who lives over there?"
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:42.200]   Even my son, Zachary, jumped over the fence or the wall when he was in high school and
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.960]   he got yelled at by the old guy that lived in that house.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.840]   That's the house we bought.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.840]   We moved in.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.640]   Some of you guys were there helping us out and we literally knocked down part of the
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.480]   fence and moved the stuff through the fence and we were there.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.880]   It's kind of weird because now we're at this house and we look into our old house that
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:04.980]   we were there for 10 years and they never closed their blinds.
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.320]   Our neighbors, so when I'm in second floor, I look down and I can see all the way through
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:12.560]   the front door and they never closed their blinds.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:18.920]   I could see, but every time I go there, we have 10 years of experience, 10 years of life.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.120]   My youngest went in there as literally a one-year-old and he came out as an 11-year-old, so we spent
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.720]   a good chunk of time in that house.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.280]   But now in our new house, I've become an old man.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.200]   Like I'm walking around the house and I tried to take care of their old house, but it wasn't
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.040]   our house, so I just fixed little things here and there.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:42.120]   But now I catch myself in my new house doing gardening.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.480]   When I go to Home Depot, before I would look for tools.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.680]   Now I look for plants.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.920]   What flower is going to work?
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.000]   In fact, right after the first service, I had a conversation with one of our brothers
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.520]   about which flowers to plant.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:02.200]   I walk around the house pulling weed, picking up trash, and I'm trying to take care of the
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:07.240]   house and I'm thinking, "Wow, now I understand why older people like gardening.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.760]   It's very relaxing."
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.240]   I think if I ever took a sabbatical, that's what I would do.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.920]   I would spend all my time just planting stuff and watering.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.920]   I know.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.560]   That's what I do.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.160]   The reason why I do that, the difference is that was my rented house.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.080]   Even though I did my best to take care of it, it wasn't my house.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.960]   I'm not going to invest money into a house that doesn't belong to me.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.800]   But in this new house, this is our place.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.800]   We bought it.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.200]   So every part of it, if something happens, I try to make it better.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.520]   I say all of that is because that's exactly what the author is saying.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:48.560]   He came, Moses came and he did a great job and God used him greatly, but all of that
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:54.720]   was to prepare for the son to come because he's the owner.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.360]   All of that is to teach us.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.880]   He purchased us.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.940]   We are that house.
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:09.640]   We belong to him and he cares for us because we are his.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:15.240]   That's why he says we need to contemplate and think carefully.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:21.520]   Consider that this God did not spare his only, even his own son, that he came to us, the
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.720]   son himself gave himself, sacrificed for us.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.200]   Should we not consider carefully who he is and what he is saying?
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   Thirdly, he says he is greater because he is the creator.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:42.040]   Hebrews chapter 3, 3 and 4, "For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses by
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.360]   just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.640]   For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God."
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.720]   He's not only the son of God, he says he built the house himself.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.000]   He's the creator.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.360]   John 1, 3, "All things came into being through him and apart from him, nothing came into
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.360]   being that came come into being."
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.720]   And Romans chapter 125 summarizes the rebellion of mankind.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.920]   It says, "For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshipped and served the
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.080]   creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.080]   Amen."
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:19.920]   Our natural tendency is to give our confidence and our weight to the things that are created
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.120]   rather than the creator.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.640]   Because you and I have been raised in the church, or a lot of us have been raised in
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.600]   the church, or maybe some of us have been Christians, but we've been Christians for
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.880]   a while.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:39.060]   So the fact that you and I confess that Jesus Christ is God, it just doesn't have the same
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:43.720]   effect that it did maybe once before.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.080]   Last night and this morning I was reading an article, and the article was stating that
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:53.920]   the government is acknowledging that there might be aliens.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.920]   Anybody read that article?
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.560]   Yeah, there was some picture that they took and they can't explain it, and Donald Trump,
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.200]   the president, basically came out and said, "Yeah, I was shown the documents.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.400]   We don't know exactly what it is.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   It could be an alien."
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.400]   Interesting.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.840]   It was on the front page.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:14.960]   Now the idea of an alien outside of us, in and of itself, that's not a Republican, that's
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.400]   not a Democrat issue, it's just people are just intrigued and interested.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.640]   I'm sure all of you guys are going to go home and look that up.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.640]   I didn't get to read the article.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.920]   I just read an excerpt of it.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.960]   But people have been for decades and decades and decades have been asking that.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.960]   They've been spending billions and billions of dollars trying to figure out, is there
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.280]   something out there?
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:42.120]   So much time contemplating and thinking and examining and studying just to see.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:47.080]   And if there is, could we make contact with this being?
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.140]   Think about that.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.640]   Because there might be something out there.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:32:02.180]   And yet, we have become so desensitized with this truth of who Jesus is that we don't spend
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:07.720]   any time other than Sunday and other than when we started the Bible that Jesus Christ
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.720]   is God.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.600]   Of course He's God.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.040]   We've been told He was God.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.560]   I've memorized He's God.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:22.280]   I can argue with an atheist and tell you why He must be God.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:28.600]   If He did nothing, if He never was incarnate, if He never came and gave His life, if He
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:36.960]   never was a high priest, if all we knew was that Jesus Christ is God, that fact alone
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:46.480]   would cause mankind to give everything that we have, everything that we have, to make
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.960]   this contact with this God.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:55.600]   If we make contact with an alien, with all the money and time and energy poured in, the
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.360]   end result is, that's interesting, the end.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.520]   It's not going to change your life.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.280]   The earth is not going to be fixed.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.300]   It's just interesting.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:12.840]   But if Jesus is God, it changes everything.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.920]   It changes everything.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.680]   Because not only did Jesus say He was God, not only did He prove that He was God, He
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.560]   said everything that He said was true.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:28.880]   In John chapter 5, verse 18, it says, "For this reason, therefore, the Jews were seeking
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.520]   all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.360]   God His own Father, making Himself equal with God."
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.640]   They understood clearly.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.240]   Jesus was not simply saying that I came to represent God.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.620]   He said Jesus is God Himself.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.800]   In that same text, Jesus says He is equal with God.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.420]   He has the ability to give life.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.020]   That alone would have been blasphemous.
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:56.840]   But in chapter 5, verse 22, it says, "For not even the Father judges anyone, but He
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.880]   has no judgment to the Son."
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.400]   Jesus does what even the Father does not do.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.720]   Think how blasphemous that is.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.000]   Jesus is clearly declaring He is God.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.480]   In fact, in John chapter 5, verse 23, He says, "So that all will honor the Son, even as they
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.480]   honor the Father.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:19.000]   He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him."
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.840]   If you've ever read the Bible, whenever holy men confront powerful men or powerful angels,
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.380]   what do they naturally do?
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.160]   They bow down and worship.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:34.280]   And what is the response of these archangels and of these men of God?
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.280]   Fear.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.860]   "Don't worship me.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.320]   I'm a man just like you.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.280]   I'm a servant.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.400]   You're not supposed to worship me.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.600]   In fact, that was the fall of all mankind.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.940]   That was the fall of all these angels.
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.340]   Do not worship me."
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:53.340]   And they're afraid to be worshipped because they know what's going to come if they step
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.160]   in those shoes of worship rather than to be a worshipper.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:00.480]   And yet Jesus is standing here and saying, "If you do not worship me, you do not worship
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.980]   the Father."
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:09.700]   If Jesus was not God, He deserved more than stoning.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.260]   He deserved more than the crucifixion.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.360]   Yet Jesus says very clearly out of His own mouth, "I do things that even the Father does
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   not do.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:24.120]   And if you do not worship me, you do not worship the Father."
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:32.080]   That fact alone should cause us to contemplate, to consider, to carefully think and meditate
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.400]   and marvel about Jesus.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:41.480]   Because no matter what stage you are in life, whether you are a graduating senior and you're
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:47.760]   about to get a new job or you're about to get married or you're going to have a child
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.760]   or starting a new business, wherever you are in life, this question of, "Who is Jesus to
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.760]   you?
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.800]   Do you believe these things?"
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   Completely changes everything.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:07.160]   Because for a believer, it changes the way that we pursue life, business, how we raise
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:11.560]   our children, who we marry, what kind of job we get.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.920]   The totality of our life is changed by this.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.960]   That's why He's saying contemplate and think carefully.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:25.760]   But fourth and finally, we need to contemplate carefully about who Jesus is because Jesus
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.440]   is the only hope for our salvation.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:33.920]   Hebrews 3.6, "Christ was faithful as a son over His house, whose house we are, if we
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.640]   hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end."
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.320]   Now, let's stop right here.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:46.760]   When He says, "If," you can read that and say, "Well, if you don't persevere, you're
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.080]   going to lose your salvation."
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.800]   Is that what He's saying?
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.960]   Or did He change His mind?
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:58.600]   Because He started chapter 3 by saying, "Holy brothers who participate in the heavenly calling."
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:04.400]   So clearly He's talking to Christians and yet in verse 6, He says, "Only if you hold
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.080]   fast the confidence until the end."
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:12.020]   So is He saying you can lose your salvation or is He saying that who He was referring
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.120]   to in verse 1 is different than He was referring to in verse 6?
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.920]   What is He saying?
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:23.600]   We have to be careful and bad doctrine always comes from superficial reading of the scripture.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.840]   Look what He says, "If you hold fast," to what?
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.040]   Our confidence.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.440]   What is another word for confidence?
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.280]   Faith.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.760]   Faith.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:42.200]   If you hold fast your faith and boast of our hope firm until the end.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.280]   He didn't change.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:50.880]   Salvation is not by, justification is not by works, and then not by, is by faith, and
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.240]   then we move to sanctification, it's by works.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:38:00.400]   Justification, sanctification, glorification is all because of faith.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:06.640]   So what He means by here is, if you believe that Christ was justified and you believe
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:14.120]   that and it is that faith that you continue to hold on to and it's that faith that causes
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:18.520]   you to persevere.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:26.240]   So the author hasn't changed anything, all he is saying is, if your confidence is true
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:35.000]   and real, if all that we hope in Christ hinges upon this faith, everything, our eternity,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:43.360]   our relationship with Christ, if it all hinges upon this faith, shouldn't we carefully contemplate
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:49.000]   and ask, "Is this faith real?
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.240]   Is this faith real?"
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:58.000]   Or is it something that you just learn to answer?
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.800]   You know how to give the answer, because you went to Sunday school, you were a Sunday school
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:06.960]   teacher, you were raised in the church, you were campus ministry, you may have even discipled
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.740]   other people, you may have even led praise for years.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:16.800]   But is this an answer that we give because we know how to give it?
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.840]   But is it coming from real faith?
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.500]   We all know the term peer pressure, right?
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.760]   We use that a lot when we're young.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.320]   But as we get older, we naturally think that we outgrow that.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.480]   "Oh, peer pressure is for children."
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:39.680]   The only difference between peer pressure when we're young and peer pressure when we're older
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.640]   is that the peer pressure come from different groups.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.200]   But that never changes.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:50.960]   I remember back in high school when punk rock was beginning to take off, and the punk rockers
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.920]   would come and we're anarchists, right?
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.360]   We don't believe in any system, we're just in rebellion.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.960]   But what was always interesting to me is they all rebelled the exact same way.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:04.160]   They all had the spiked hair, they all had the anarchist tattoo and the leather jacket
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.760]   and the spikes in their hand.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.000]   We're anarchists.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.880]   If you're an anarchist, you should be very, very different, right?
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.400]   I said, "No."
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.920]   But they all rebelled the exact same way.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:21.840]   The peer pressure that they were submitting to were just a different set.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.400]   Don't fool ourselves.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.560]   Peer pressure has a grip on all of us.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.760]   In fact, there's a psychological term for that.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.640]   They call it contagion norm.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   That's the technical term.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.120]   If you took any psychology, that's what they call it.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:40.000]   That term came out of a study in 1970, May 4th.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.480]   There was a protest against the Vietnam War, against the government, that we shouldn't
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.480]   be in there.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.400]   A small group of students gathered together and they began to protest.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.720]   The protest started growing and it became violent.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:58.080]   The state troopers came in and in order to calm the crowd, it got out of hand and they
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.880]   ended up shooting.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.280]   Four students got killed and many others got injured.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:10.160]   After everything was said and done, people came in to interview and see what caused this.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:15.120]   They began to interview the students of why this happened and why did it escalate and
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.920]   why did the state troopers ended up shooting.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.800]   The interesting thing was, the majority of the students had no idea why they were out
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   there.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.280]   The majority of the students could not articulate why they were there.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.280]   They began to ask them, "Then why were you there?"
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.600]   This small group of students who gathered together began to grow to hundreds and even
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.880]   thousands and that's why the state troopers were called.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:42.400]   They said, "What happened was, there was a small group of students who came out protesting
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:48.640]   and it just happened that all the big classes were finishing their class right at that time.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.640]   As they were walking out, they saw the crowd and they just came to look.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.480]   They began to chant.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.600]   They got caught up in the moment.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.640]   They began to chant and the group started to grow to hundreds.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:03.520]   The word began to spread through campus and there's something going on over there.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.080]   So they started attracting all the students to this area and then that attracted the attention
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.080]   of the police because they were beginning to get concerned with the size of the crowd.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:17.580]   And once the police came, the rock started to be thrown and in defense, it irritated
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:22.240]   some of the police and they began to shoot.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:29.680]   Patriotism is just a fancy word for peer pressure.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.360]   None of us are exempt from that.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.160]   None of us.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:42.520]   If a student can be pressured without even knowing what they're doing to even risk their
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:51.340]   lives protesting something that they don't even understand, it's very, very easy to be
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:58.880]   at church all your life just doing what other people do.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.640]   That's why majority of the people's spirituality goes up and down based upon which church they're
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.140]   at, what is expected of them.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:12.020]   Their holiness changes based upon what the church requires.
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:16.360]   And if our holiness, if our passion for God goes up and down based upon the kind of friends
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:22.540]   that you put around you, isn't that just peer pressure?
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:27.340]   Maybe it's not, but there's a good chance that it could be.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:35.900]   If all your life, your faith goes up and down, up and down based upon who is around you.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:47.760]   This is why we need to contemplate, think carefully, meditate about who Jesus is.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.120]   Who is Jesus to you?
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:53.600]   Not your friends, not your pastor, not your circle, not your parents.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.280]   Who is Jesus to you?
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:01.040]   Before you answer that question too quickly, everybody says, "Well, Jesus means this to
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.840]   me in my heart."
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.700]   We can say that, but if you want to know what kind of relationship two people have, you
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.220]   don't just ask them.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.540]   One person says, "Oh, he's my best friend."
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.780]   It's like, "He's your best friend?
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.780]   How come I never see you with him?
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.140]   How come you never talk to him?
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:20.420]   How come you're not there on his birthday?"
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.420]   You know?
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.420]   When's the last time you talked to him?
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:26.180]   It's like, "Well, he is, but we haven't talked for 15 years."
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:30.900]   That's strange because what you say, what you do don't match.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.900]   We have to ask ourselves.
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:39.980]   If that's the most important question in life, are we confident that this faith, this confidence
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.780]   that we have is real?
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.060]   I'm going to give you a preview of next week before I finish.
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.740]   All of this leads to this, this imperative.
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:53.260]   Consider him, Hebrews 3, 7, 8.
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:57.300]   Considering all of this, therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, if you hear
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:03.540]   his voice, do not harden your hearts as when they provoked me, as in the day of trial in
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.540]   the wilderness."
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:13.580]   Our salvation is not by works, it's not by good intentions, it's not by being smart,
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:19.180]   but by having confidence in Christ and who he is and what he has done.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:26.260]   So again, as the author of Hebrews is challenging us and encouraging us, and I hope and pray
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.660]   because the whole book of Hebrews is about Jesus.
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:35.140]   The whole book of Hebrews is about considering and contemplating Christ.
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:38.820]   So I hope at some point you don't just say, "Enough.
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.580]   Let's talk about the Holy Spirit now."
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.900]   Or, "Give me something practical.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.660]   How do I become a good father?"
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:51.020]   I hope that doesn't happen because all the other questions will naturally be answered
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.660]   if you can answer this question.
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:56.180]   Who is Jesus to you?
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:46:00.860]   Jesus to you. Let's take some time to pray.
