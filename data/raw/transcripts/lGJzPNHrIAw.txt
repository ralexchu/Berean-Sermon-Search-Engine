[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   >> Amen, you may be seated.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   >> My name is Priscilla Chen, and I'm a freshman in the college ministry, and
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   today I'll be sharing my testimony with you all.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Before attending Berean, starting in high school, I grew up in another church that
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   was really like a second home to me.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   I knew all the other kids and their families.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   My parents were both leaders in the church, and my siblings and
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   I were very involved in church activities.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   I was convinced that my Christian-like deeds and shallow knowledge of God and
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   the Bible were enough to prove that I was a Christian, and in 2017,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   I got baptized.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   A month after I was baptized, our youth pastor passed away unexpectedly at a
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   young age, and it shook the youth ministry and church as a whole.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   What a fragile illusion of faith I had was completely shattered as I turned in
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   anger towards God, questioning why he had cut short the life of a man so
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   dedicated to the church and his ministry.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   I soon began to doubt the existence of God altogether, refusing to believe that
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   this could be part of the plan of a God who truly loved his people.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   As I dwelt on past memories, I was consumed by overwhelming guilt about the
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   reflection of Christ's love my pastor had shown to me all those years that I had
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   taken for granted and casually dismissed.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Guilt, coupled with my growing unbelief, quickly drove me away from the church
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   and Christianity, as I tried to run as far away from God as I could.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   I got a job and began to hang out with bad friends who introduced me to all the
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   evil things this world has to offer.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   For every empty void that I felt in my life, I found a sin to indulge in, to find
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   temporary satisfaction and self-worth.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   In a worldly sense, I never felt more free.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   I had the means to buy and do the things I wanted, and friends to reassure me that
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   this was right and that I was happy.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   During the summer after my sophomore year of high school, my sister sat down to
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   talk with me about the concerns my parents had voiced about my rebellious
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   behavior and refusal to attend church.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   She invited me to visit Berean with her, and when I joined the youth group, I saw
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   believers who were my age or even younger who had genuine faith and lived a life
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   that truly reflected that.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Instead of being encouraged at the time, I felt ashamed that all the years I'd spent
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   growing up in the church had led me to this point of living a double life, feeling
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   guilty and turning on my Christian act every Friday and Sunday, yet returning to
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   my self-serving, sin-ruled lifestyle every day in between.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   My pride and unwillingness to accept the challenge of rebuilding my faith led to a
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   long period of struggle between wanting to hold on to this newfound worldly freedom
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   and the salvation I knew I dearly needed.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   During a youth retreat in February of 2020, Pastor Nate spoke on cultivating a
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   hunger and desire for the Bible.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   He said, "A hunger and thirst for the Word can't be artificially generated.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Only the believer truly cherishes his Word.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   And if you say, 'I need God,' and don't immediately turn to the Bible, you don't
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   believe you truly need God."
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   I remember him reading John 11, 25 to 26, in which Jesus says, "I am the
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   resurrection and the life.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   He who believes in me will live, even if he dies.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Do you believe this?"
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   For the first time, I felt truly confronted with the question, "Are you a believer?"
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Up until then, I had never even considered that I might not be saved since I had done
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   all the right things.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   I went to church since I was young, memorized Bible verses, served, and even got
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   baptized.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   But as I considered the lifestyle of an unbeliever reflective of complacency and
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   unrepentant sin, there was a moment of realization when I finally accepted that
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   despite all the years of playing the part of being a Christian, there was no gray
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   area.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   I had no relationship of God and nothing of Christ in me.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   The weight of this realization and recognition of the consequences of my status
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   as a transgressor against the holy God had set in, and I understood for the first
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   time why the good news truly is good news to a sinner like myself.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Looking back now, it was truly only possible by God's mercy and grace that my
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   hardened heart of unbelief was softened and my eyes were opened to see the utter
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   sin and depravity in my life.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   I was convicted of countless sins as I began taking baby steps as an infant
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   believer and reading the Bible, praying, and making my relationship with God
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   personal for myself.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   As a result, my life began to change as I let go of the worldly things I had held
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   onto so tightly in light of this newfound treasure that had been revealed to me.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   Since then, I've still fallen into sin and no doubt will continue to until the day
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   I die.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   But I trust that I am being sanctified through each and every trial and triumph in
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   life, all for the glory of God, as I strive to live out the calling of all
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   Christians, having received and being a steward of God's grace.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Thank you.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   [Applause]
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   [Pause]
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   [Applause]
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   >> All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   We'll be looking at verse 32 to 35.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   And again, thank you, Priscilla, for the testimony.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   And again, Priscilla, because she was a friend of my daughter, Faith, we're able
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   to see her since high school grow and mature and then come to church and really
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   give her life to Christ.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   So, you know, hearing her testimony just, again, personally, it's been a great
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   encouragement to see her grow.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   If you can, again, look at verse 32 to 35, reading out of the NASB.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   "And what more shall I say, for time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, who by faith conquered
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   were made strong, became mighty in war, but formed armies to fight.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   Women received back their dead by resurrection, and others were tortured, not
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   accepting their release so that they might obtain a better resurrection."
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   Let's pray.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray for enlightenment.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to guide us, not only to understand the content,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   but your very heart.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Help us, Lord God, that we may see a glimpse of your glory through this text.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   Amen.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   You know, now that the pandemic is slowly releasing, obviously we're not there
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   yet, there's quite a few other things that need to happen, but there's more and
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   more talks, especially in the church, of what the church is going to look like
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   when it does finally open up.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Open up meaning like fully open, and we're back to whatever we were doing
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   before, without the concern of being distancing and wearing masks and, you
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   know, having group pictures without wearing masks.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   I mean, we're going to get back to that at some point.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   But now that we're headed toward that direction, there's more and more
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   conversations among churches, what is the church going to look like?
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   Because according to statistics, half of the millennials, half of the
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   millennials, if you don't know, are somewhere around 39 to 40 and under.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   And then I don't know where the next generation starts, but that's the
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   millennials, which is a big part of our church falls into that category.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   And they said that over 50% has either dropped out or moved away from their
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   church.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   I'm not exactly sure what the statistics for the other age groups, the
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   X generation and the boomers and then the younger generation are, but, you
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   know, because that's kind of like the demographic that our church is in,
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   at least a large number, there's a lot of conversations.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   What is the church going to look like?
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Are the people ever going to really come back?
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   And I've had conversations with a few of my friends in other places who are
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   just starting to open up, and they're having a hard time getting their church
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   people to come back out.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   And so that fear is going to linger for a while.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   And so within that conversation, there are talks about having churches
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   completely different going forward, that in order to accommodate what has
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   happened, that maybe we should just be online.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   Maybe they don't need to physically gather.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   In fact, there are more and more conversations about church planting
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   that's happening only online.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   There is no physical gathering in order to kind of roll with the punches and to
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   accommodate what's going on in order for us to reach this new generation of
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   people who are fearful of gathering together.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Maybe we don't need to gather at all.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   So the concern that we have now going forward is what is the church going to
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   look like in the next two to three to four to five years because of this?
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   Obviously, we are concerned about that going forward, you know,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   but this is nothing new.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   I remember when I was back in college and maybe come in seminary,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   one of the biggest questions that they were trying to deal with at that time
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   was the X generation, right?
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   The X generation, right after the boomers, you have the X generation,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   and they were saying that the X generation was having a mass exodus away
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   from the church.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   And we were hearing statistics that for every two people that converted,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   three people were backsliding.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   In particular, in the Southern Baptists, for every one church that was planted,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   two churches were shutting down.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   And so they were losing that generation rapidly.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   You know, I was a youth pastor at that time, and I started to see the exodus,
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   and I started to see that the statistics was, at least in the community that I
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   belonged to, about 80% of them attended church until high school.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   But by the time they got to college, that 80% turned to 40%.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   And by the time they graduated college up until they became young adults,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   they said somewhere around 87% that attended church in high school by the
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   time they became young adults were no longer going to church.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   So because of this fear, there was this stir.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   If the church doesn't do something, within the next generation,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   we're going to lose the church.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   And that's where the Seeker Friendly Movement came in,
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   that maybe we need to do church differently.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   Instead of having the traditional church, since it doesn't work,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   maybe we can make the sermon shorter.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Maybe we can make the praise more vibrant.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   Maybe we can have maybe more skits, just like we are attracting children.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   Maybe we can attract adults this way.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   But the fundamental reasoning behind why the church started to change was
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   because there was this great concern that we're going to lose this generation.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   So as a result of that, they started challenging everything.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   Do we need to have a sermon?
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   Couldn't it just be a gathering?
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   Do we need to have worship on Sunday?
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Couldn't it be on Wednesday or Saturday?
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   Do we need to do this? Do we need to do that?
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   So anything that wasn't absolutely crystal clearly nailed down in Scripture,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   everybody wanted to test the borders and just kind of,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   "Let's have a new church to bring a new generation."
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   And this method, physically, humanly speaking, worked.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   It worked because they started coming back.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   Large churches started popping up, left and right,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   where prior to that, the churches were dying.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   And we're in seminary being trained,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   and we're going into a field where people are leaving the church instead of coming.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   But now all of a sudden, you have churches that are popping up,
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   and you have hundreds, not just hundreds, and thousands,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   tens of thousands of people are gathering together.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   And so all of a sudden, people started to copy that model,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   and that seeker-friendly movement started to spread all over the world.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   We're in a similar stage right now where everything is being questioned.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   Do we really need to gather?
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   Do we really need to physically meet together?
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   Now, before anybody gets confused, let me make that crystal clear.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   The very word for church means "to gather."
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   That's the very essence of the word.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   So you can't call it a church without a gathering.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Obviously, temporarily, because of what was going on, we had to go online.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   And the reason why we got together as soon as we were capable of getting together,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   because this is essential.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   The gathering of the believers is essential.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Not just hearing sermons, right?
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Not just participating on Sunday morning for that one and a half hour,
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   just sitting in front of the television and watching this.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   For a period, we had to do that because of what was going on around us.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   But the very essence of what a church is, is to gather.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   That's why we want to encourage, at some point,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   you have to get off online and need to come to church physically,
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   because it is not the church you are experiencing online.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   It is temporary.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   But when we look at what is happening,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   whether it was back then, fear of losing the church,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   and whether it's now, where my guess is, in the next two to three years,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   you're going to see churches just solely online,
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   in order to accommodate the fear of people.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   This is nothing new to church history.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   In fact, if you studied church history in the last 2,000 years,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   you might be shocked to think, "How did we get here?"
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   There was a period in church history where the top leader of the church
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   was selling salvation for money.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   And anybody who wanted to read the Bible or translate the Bible,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   they were the ones who were persecuted, burned at the stakes,
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   and had their heads chopped off for questioning the church.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   And we're not just talking about one period.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   In 2,000 years, we can pinpoint many, many times
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   where we would have humanly said, "There's no way that this church
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   is going to make it outside the first century."
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   But if anything that church history teaches us,
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   is that despite the failing of man,
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   despite man's sins, despite man's fears,
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   God is faithful to His promises.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   Chapter 11, as much as we highlight these men and women,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   these heroes of faith, the cloud of witnesses that have gone before us,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   the real power behind what he's saying in Chapter 11
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   is not that God found these faithful men, these few faithful men,
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   and that He raised them up and did powerful things
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   but He found quality people in the midst of all these people who are falling out.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   In fact, Chapter 11 isn't about that at all.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   Chapter 11, that's why he says it is by faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   By faith, Gideon did this. By faith, Jephthah did this.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   By faith, Samson did that.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   If we look carefully at who these people are,
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   in fact, I'm going to discourage you instead of encouraging you today
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   because it's much easier to find faults in people
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   than to highlight their strength.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   That's just true in life.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   You ask somebody, "What do you appreciate about that person?"
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   You have to sit there and think a little bit.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   "What do you think they're going to work on?"
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   "Well, I've got a whole list. I've been waiting for the opportunity to tell you."
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   Because it is easier.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   What he says in Hebrews 11, verse 32, we have three sets of people.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   We have the judges.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   The judges lasted during the period when Israelites came into the Promised Land
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   and they didn't have a formal government yet.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   So God would raise up these judges and this cycle of judges that would come.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   And then it was about 200 years of that.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   And after that, we come to the kings and prophets.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   Where kings are established and prophets are sent by God
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   to constantly warn them and tell them that they're going the right direction.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   So we're moving away from the patriarchs.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   We're now talking about the period of the judges.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   And then he summarizes all of the kings and prophets by David, Samuel, and the prophets.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   So it's like a very broad brush that he uses.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   Now, all of these things he kind of summarizes.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   He's been going into detail about what these men and women did.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   But now he just summarizes by saying, "Who by faith conquered kingdoms,
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises,
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   escaped the edge of the sword, and on and on and on."
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   They did powerful things in God's kingdom.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   So our natural tendency is to look at what was it about Gideon?
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   He conquered an army of over 100,000 with 300 men.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   What did he do?
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   What was it about him that God would allow him to use?
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   Samson single-handedly delivers Israel from the Philistines.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   What was it about Samson and his hair?
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   So maybe we should grow our hair.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   And our natural tendency is to want to see what is it about their character?
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   What is it about their background?
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   What is it about their upbringing that God was able to see their faithfulness
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   and use that for his glory?
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   But if you take a closer look at who they are, I think you'll agree with me.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   You'll come out with a bigger question than answer.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   These are the people that God used.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   So I want to start with Gideon.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   Gideon was a doubting conqueror of the Midianites.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   That's really what the title should be.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Gideon was a doubter.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   So Gideon, basically during that period of Judges,
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   the theme in the Book of Judges is they all did what they thought was right
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   in their own eyes because they didn't have a king.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   So as soon as they started to do their own thing,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   they started straying away from God and disobeying the commandment.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   And as a result, the Midianites and the Canaanites and the Philistines,
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   they would come and conquer them.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   And after they are conquered, they are oppressed.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   And in their oppression, they would cry out to God,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   just like they did when they were in Egypt.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   And God would be merciful to them and raise up a judge,
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   and through that judge would deliver them.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   And so this is a constant cycle in the Book of Judges.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   It's repetition over and over again.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   And so, with the Gideon, the Midianites took over,
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   and they were being oppressed by the Midianites.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   So God calls Gideon and tells him that he's about to deliver the nation of Israel from them.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   And this is how Gideon responds.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   Judges 6, 13, Gideon said to him, "Oh, my Lord, if the Lord is with us,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   why then has all this happened to us?
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   And where are all his miracles which our fathers told us about,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   saying, 'Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   And now the Lord has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian.'"
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   You see, Gideon's response when God says that he's going to deliver them isn't,
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   "Thank you, Lord. We've been waiting for you."
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   He says, "No, if you're really going to deliver us,
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   why are we in this situation to begin with?"
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   You know, I think a shortened version maybe of this is, "Yeah, right."
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   I think there's a long way of saying, God says, "I'm going to deliver you."
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   He's like, "Yeah, right. You're going to deliver us?
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   Why are we in this situation to begin with?
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   I heard of what you did in the past, but I haven't seen anything recently."
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   But God is patient with him.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   "The Lord looked at him and said, 'Go in your strength and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   Have I not sent you? Have I not sent you?'"
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   You remember that? He says exactly the same thing to Moses.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   It wasn't you. I'm sending you.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   Gideon says to the Lord, "Oh, Lord, how shall I deliver Israel?"
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   Stop right there.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   That's arrogance already.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   As if God was waiting for Gideon to be born,
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   and the Israelites were so weak until Gideon came.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   Finally, we have our deliverer, Gideon, and then God coming to Gideon,
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   "Would you please deliver Israel for us?"
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   "Lord, how am I going to deliver Israel?
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   Behold, my family is the least in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father's house."
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   Maybe you got the wrong guy.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   Maybe the guy down the street, his father's wealthy.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   Maybe the other guy who's well-connected.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   "But the Lord said to him, 'Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat Midian as one man.'"
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   Now, I mean, think about the patience of our God.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   "Oh, yeah, yeah, right.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   I heard of you, but I haven't seen anything recently.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   But I will be with you.'"
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   He's like, "I don't know. I don't know if I'm the right guy."
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   And he says, "No, I will be with you."
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   "So Gideon said to him, 'If now I have found favor in your sight,
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me.'"
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   In other words, prove yourself.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   The arrogance.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   He's talking to God Almighty.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   You would think God would say, "Okay, let me move on.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   Go to the next guy."
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   And we wouldn't know who Gideon is.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   Gideon is the guy who talked back to God, and he died. The end.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   But he's patient with him.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   He said, "Well, I'm going to set out a fleece,
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   and then make the due on everything except for the fleece."
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   And he would keep that.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   I mean, even the proof that he asked for is so trivial.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   "Keep it dry. Then I'll believe you."
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   The fact that he delivered Israel from Egypt
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   and all the plagues that he's been hearing,
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   sustaining this nation, conquering of Jericho.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   He said, "You prove yourself. Keep this thing dry.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   Keep it dry."
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   And then so, God's patience, he keeps it dry.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   Okay, okay, okay. All right. That's a good trick.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   One more.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   "Make just that wet, and everything else dry."
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   I mean, think about even what he's asking for proof is so trivial.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   God, in his patience, actually answers his prayer, answers his request.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   But he wanted to make sure, because he knew what was in his heart.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   He knew what was in Israel's heart.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   As soon as he delivers them from the Midianites,
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   that they're going to say, "Oh, maybe I was the right guy.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   Maybe I wasn't. Maybe my sin was I didn't have a high view of myself."
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   And so God says in verse 2, chapter 7,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   "The Lord said to Gideon, 'The people who are with you are too many for me
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   to give you into their hands.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   For Israel would become boastful, saying, 'My own power has delivered me.'"
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   So in order to keep them humble, letting them know it was God who delivers them,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   despite Gideon, despite the sins of the Israelites,
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   he dwindles down an army of 32,000 men,
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   going against 135,000 Midianites.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   He dwindles that down, and he says, "Well, anybody afraid, you don't need to stay."
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   And only 22,000 of them leave, and then eventually he dwindles them down.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   And so you go to the water, and only the ones who drink and lap up the water,
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   the ones that put their mouth into the water like a dog, let them go home.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   And the number dwindles down to 300.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   Can you imagine Gideon watching that?
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   He's like, "No, no, no! Don't put your face in that! Oh, we lost another one!"
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   300 is left after all of that.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   And obviously God miraculously delivers them because he wanted to make sure
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   that God was being faithful to his covenant promise,
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   despite Gideon's weak faith.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   Look at Barak.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   Barak is... his name is not known very well because along with Barak is Deborah.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   And her name is the one usually posted up.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   It's like, "Oh, how come we don't have a woman pastor? What about Deborah?"
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   Well, Deborah was the judge at that time,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   and God tells Deborah that he's going to deliver the Israelites from the Canaanites.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   And so Deborah calls Barak and says, "You know, God wants to establish you as the commander,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   and he's going to deliver you." And this is what Barak says to Deborah.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   Then Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, then I will go.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   If you will not go with me, I will not go."
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   God told you to go.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   It's not enough that God says he's going to go with you.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   He said, "Well, okay, but I need you to go."
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   This is what Deborah says, verse 9.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   "I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the honor shall not be yours on the journey
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   that you are about to take, for the Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman."
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   Because you couldn't be man enough to trust in God,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   and you need a woman to lean on, so the honor is not going to go to you.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   It's going to come to me, right? Ultimately, it's going to go to God.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   Barak, in his fear, despite his fear, instead of crushing Barak,
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   Barak makes it onto this list.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   You're almost kind of like, "Why is Deborah not there? Why is Barak there?"
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   Because the point of it was not Gideon and Barak to begin with.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   Samson, man, this guy, it's hard to believe he's on this list of all the people.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   I think most people, Christian and non-Christian, know who Samson is
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   because he's a guy, single-handedly, who conquered the Philistines.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   But I remember the first time preaching through judges, and by the time I got to Samson,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   I read this story over and over and over and over again because I thought I'd missed something.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   But I did not. So I want to show you what I saw.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   Samson was a Nazarite who was dedicated to be set apart for God's use.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   And so there were two particular vows that a Nazarite was supposed to have,
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   to never touch wine and to never cut his hair.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   Well, he broke that not touching wine. I don't know when he broke it,
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   but according to what we see, it looks like he broke it as soon as he was able to drink
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   because this guy is known as a drunkard.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   Every opportunity we see him, he's drunk.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   And he was a womanizer.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   The only vow that he, at least that we see that he kept, was he didn't cut his hair.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   That was the only thing that kept him to his vow was he didn't cut his hair.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   And my guess is it was probably because he was lazy.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   If you look at his character.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   So in that situation, the Philistines have conquered Israelites.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   God has mercy on them because they're crying out.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   And so he is going to use this man.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   I think the best way to describe what Samson was like,
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   he's a frat guy, went to college.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   He's going to be the cool guy on campus.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   He's going to drink it up and he's going to have plenty of stories to tell.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   That's how he comes out.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   So if you're curious, go read it for yourself.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   But I'm just going to highlight the point where Delilah shows up.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   So he's a womanizer.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   Delilah must have been really pretty because the Philistines choose her
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   knowing that he's a womanizer to get the secret out of this guy
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   because he's been causing so much trouble for the Philistines.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   Find out the source of his strength so that we can bind him and kill him.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   So Delilah is deliberately sent to him and he falls in lust.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   And this is what happens.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   Verse 6, "So Delilah said to Samson,
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   'Please tell me where your great strength is and how you may be bound to afflict you.'"
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   He should have stopped right there.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   What did you say?
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   You want me to tell you how to kill me, right?
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   No.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   If he was a normal person, that would have been enough.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   He's like, "I don't know.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   I know my mom, my friends warned me about Delilah, but here it is."
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   "But Samson said to her," in verse 7,
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   '"If they bind me with seven fresh cords that have not been dried,
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   then I will become weak and be like any other man."
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   Obviously, he wasn't telling the truth.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   He wasn't that dumb, at least not yet.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   Verse 8, "Then the Lord of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh cords
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   that had not been dried, and she bound him with them."
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   She did it.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   She didn't even just get the information and move out.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   She actually binds him with the information that he gave her.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   And then now she had men lying in wait in the inner room,
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   "And she said to him, 'The Philistines are upon you, Samson.'
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   But he snapped the cords as a string of toe snaps when it touches fire,
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   so his strength was not discovered."
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   You would think by now Samson was like,
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   'I told you the secret, and you bind me, and then you call the Philistines?
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   What are you doing?'"
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   That's not what happens in verse 10.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   "Then Delilah said to Samson, 'Behold, you have deceived me.'"
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   She must have been really pretty.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   "Behold, you have deceived me and told me lies.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   Now please tell me how you may be bound so I can kill you."
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   "He said to her, 'If they bind me tightly with new robes which have not been used,
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   then I will become weak and be like any other man.'
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   So Delilah took new robes and bound him with them and said to him,
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   'The Philistines are upon you, Samson.'
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   For the men were lying in wait in the inner room,
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   but he snapped the robes from his arms like a thread."
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   First time it's unbelievable.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   Second time, are you kidding me?
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   How pretty was Delilah?
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   You would think second time, 'I didn't get away with the second time.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   Maybe I should run by now.'"
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   Verse 13, "Then Delilah said to Samson,
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   'Up to now you have deceived me and told me lies.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   Tell me how you may be bound.'"
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   "You're not treating me right, Samson.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   If you say you love me, show me how to kill you."
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   Basically, that's what she's saying.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   "And he said to her, 'If you weave the seven locks of my hair with the web
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   and fasten it with a pin, then I will become weak and be like any other man.'
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his hair
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   and wove them into the web, and she fastened it with a pin
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   and said to him, 'The Philistines are upon you, Samson.'
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   But he awoke from his sleep and pulled out the pin of the loom and the web,
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   and then he conquers them."
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   Doesn't stop, right?
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   Unbelievable.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   If any of your friends were in that situation,
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   you would probably beat him senseless and drag him out of that house.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   But that's not where it ends.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   Verse 13, "Then she said to him, 'How can you say I love you
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   when your heart is not with me?
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   You won't let me kill you.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   You have deceived me these three times
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   and have not told me where your great strength is.'
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   It came out when she pressed him daily with her words."
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   Daily. "Pressed him daily" is another word for "nagged him to death."
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   That's what that means.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   "She nagged him to death daily with words and urged him,
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   and his soul was so annoyed to death."
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   They were both about to die.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   Her with her nagging, and he just couldn't stand it anymore.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   "So he told her all that was in the heart and said to her,
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   'A razor has never come on my head, for I have been a Nazarite to God
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   from my mother's womb.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   If I am shaved, then my strength will leave me,
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   and I will become weak and be like any other man.'"
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   So you know what the story is.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   You can tell him he shaves his head, he becomes weak.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   And we look at that, well, was the strength really in his hair?
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   No, that was the vow that he took.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   That was the little connection that he had with God.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   And then when he told her the secret and his head is shaved off,
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   that little connection that he had with God, he lost.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   And I think that's why he lost his power.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   And then they drag him in, and then he repents and comes before God,
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   and he has one more chance, and that's how he conquers the Philistines.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   Yeah, that's Emson.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   That's the guy that's in this hall of fame.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   Now you say, "Well, did I miss something?
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   Was there something that I missed?"
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   Maybe after all this, that something great happened, he redeemed himself.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   No, that's how it ends.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   That's what he did.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   That's what he did, and then God used this drunkard who was womanizing,
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   to bind to what Delilah was doing, and then he conquers and then he dies.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   These men do not come out as heroes, at least not when we read them.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   Jephthah, there's not a whole lot, but Jephthah, during his time,
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   the Ammonites take charge, and God says to Jephthah, and he pleads with God,
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   "If you would deliver Israelites to me, then I will dedicate whatever comes out of my house,
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   the first thing that comes out of my house, as a burnt offering."
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   Well, they end up conquering the Ammonites, and he comes back,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   and his only daughter, he only has one daughter, one child,
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   one daughter that he loved and cherished, and she's the one who walks out.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   And he keeps his vow, and so if you read the commentaries,
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   people are trying to twist this.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   Now, maybe it wasn't a sacrifice.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   It was just a dedication to the temple.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   But if you read the story, it looks like he sacrificed her.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   And I remember I was studying through that.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   It's like, "Oh, God, how did this happen?"
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   What's interesting is during that period, human sacrifice was part of the pagan worship.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   So it could have been, again, this is my take on it,
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   that Jephthah was already so compromised that human sacrifice was a part of their practice.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   The only thing that he regretted was not that he gave human sacrifice,
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   but that it was his daughter.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   But what's also interesting about Jephthah's story is God is never mentioned in his story.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   God never speaks to Jephthah.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   God never intervenes.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   God doesn't say it's right, it's wrong.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   It just happens at the end.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   So at the least, Jephthah, even he is questionable, a big question.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   Well, it doesn't stop with the judges, right?
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   After all of this cycle, Samuel comes in.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   And Samuel, the reason why he's prominent is he's the last of the judges
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   and first of the prophets during the king's era.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   Samuel is the one who anoints Saul and then anoints King David.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   So it says David, Samuel, and the prophets.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   They're all mentioned in those two names.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   But if you look at how they transition from the judges to the kings,
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   it's not a happy transition.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   This is what it says, 1 Samuel 8, 1 through 9.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   "And it came about when Samuel was old that he appointed his sons judges over Israel.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   Now the name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second, Abijah.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   They were judging in Beersheba.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   His sons, however, did not walk in the ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   and took bribes and perverted justice."
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   So the people of Israel got tired of them, this family, for what they were doing.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   "And as a result of that," in verse 4, it says, "then all the elders of Israel gathered together
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   and came to Samuel and Ramah and said to him, 'Behold, you have grown old,
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   and your sons do not walk in your ways.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   Now appoint a king for us to judge us like all the nations.'"
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   So it wasn't God's idea.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   It was Israelites.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   And so they started seeing all these problems in Israel.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   And so their solution was maybe the reason why we keep getting into this trouble
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   is because we don't have a king like the other kings.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   Maybe we need a king like the Philistines and the Ammonites and the Midianites.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   And so their solution was a human solution,
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   not realizing the reason why they kept on going into this cycle
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   is because they kept on disobeying God.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   They did have a king.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   God was their king.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   But just like all humankind,
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   they choose to worship the Creator rather than the creation.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   So they thought maybe if we had the king that our destiny will change.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   Verse 6, "But the thing was displeasing in the sight of Samuel when they said,
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   'Give us a king to judge us.'
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   And Samuel prayed to the Lord.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   The Lord said to Samuel, 'Listen to the voice of the people in regard to all that they say to you,
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.'
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   God saw them asking for a king,
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   saying that maybe you're not enough.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   Maybe what we need is what they have.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   And so the era of the king starts as a rejection to God.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   The next person that comes up on this is David,
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   because Saul obviously was not a believer.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   He gets rejected. That's the guy that he chooses.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   But David's the man that God chooses himself.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   He's a young man who is after his own heart, he says.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   So of all the kings that existed in Israel,
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   they will say the greatest of the king was David.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   In fact, the majority of the kings in Israel led the nation astray.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   David was the man that they would lift up and say, "He's our true king."
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   Only if we had King David again.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   But of all the kings that committed sin,
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   David's sin was probably the most heinous from a human point of view.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   You know what happens in 1 Samuel 11,
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   when all the kings were going to war,
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   David was just kind of enjoying his success,
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   and he sent his soldiers out, and he was just kind of perusing on the rooftop,
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   and he saw Bathsheba taking a bath, and again, he falls in lust.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   He's the king. He can do whatever he wants.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   So he commands her to come, and he sleeps with her.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   And basically, after that, she gets pregnant.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   And in order to hide his sin, he has an idea.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   He's going to call her husband back from war.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   He was a commander, so he said, "We're going to give you a special privilege,"
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   pretending like he's doing him a favor, and asked him,
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   "You want to come back and sleep with your wife?
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   I'm going to give you a break before you go in because you did such a great job."
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   But Uriah, being an honorable man,
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   instead of going in and sleeping with his wife,
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   he says, 2 Samuel 11, 11, it says, "Uriah said to David,
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   'The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in temporary shelters,
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   Shall I then go to my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife?
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   By your life and the life of your soul, I will not do this thing.'"
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   Because Uriah was an honorable man.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   Even though David was trying to trick him to cover his sin,
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   he wouldn't go into his wife.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   "My men are out there fighting. How can I go in to do that?"
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   And so that didn't work.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   But David hardens his heart, and he needs to cover his sin somehow.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000]   So he lets Uriah go into battle, and he tells the other commanding officers,
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   "When he's at the front of the battle, withdraw all your men
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   so that he's by himself, and so that he will be killed,
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   and so that in history books it will say that he died fighting for Israel.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   But in reality, David murders him."
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   This is the best king of Israel.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000]   This is the man after God's own heart.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   A loyal man, a faithful man, a godly man,
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   simply because he wanted his wife, and simply because he was the king,
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   and he was able to do it.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   But you know what makes it even worse?
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   Uriah was not any ordinary man.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   He wasn't a commander among many commanders.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   There were in the Bible a listed 30 men
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   who were called valiant warriors for David, for the nation of Israel.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   So these were the guys, if they went to battle, and if every other person died,
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   these are the 30 men that would surround David and take the sword for him.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   These are the men who would sacrifice everything, that they came up the ranks
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   and were known to be loyal to David, who loved David.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   Uriah was such a man because in 1 Chronicles 11, 26-47,
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   those 30 men's names are actually mentioned.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   That's how prominent they are.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   And in this list, without reading all of it, if you get to verse 41,
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   Uriah the Hittite, his name is on the list of 30 people
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   who committed to die for David in battle.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   And it was that guy's wife that he took.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   It was that guy that he murdered.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   And he is on this list.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000]   We look at that and say, "How can God choose this man?
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   How can this be a man among heroes that we're to emulate and follow?"
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   Because the point of redemptive history are not these people.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   The point of redemptive history is by faith, by faith.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000]   Despite the weakness of their faith, despite their fear,
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   despite their moral shortcoming, despite murder,
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   God kept faithful to his covenant.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   The only reason why you and I are here is not because God found
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   potential people to keep the church alive.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   The only reason why you and I are here is because God was faithful to his covenant,
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   that if you confess your sins, he is faithful and just to forgive you of all your unrighteousness,
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   because he keeps that promise.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   As long as we have faith to believe that Christ forgives us
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   and causes us to continue to repent and seek after him,
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   he remains faithful to that promise.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   You and I are not here because we were more disciplined than others.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   You and I are not here because we were more faithful than other people,
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   that we were more talented, we had better character, we had more morals than other people.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   It's by faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   That's why Paul, when he describes himself in 1 Timothy 1, 15, 7,
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000]   it is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   to save sinners among whom I am the foremost.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   Yet for this reason I found mercy so that in me as the foremost,
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   Jesus Christ might demonstrate his perfect patience as an example for those
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   who would believe in him for eternal life.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   God didn't choose him because he was famous.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   God didn't choose him because he was a Roman citizen.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000]   God didn't choose him because he was being educated above all his peers.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   He said the primary reason why he was chosen, so that when people see his salvation,
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   they say, "God can save him? That guy was a murderer.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   He's responsible for the first martyr in the church, Stephen.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   He was beating up our friends, our father, our children.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   And if God can save him, what does that say about the gospel?"
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:27.000]   He was chosen because he was unworthy, because he was the greatest of sinners,
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   in order to demonstrate that it is by faith and by faith alone.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   And it is that same message all throughout the Old Testament,
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   all throughout the New Testament, all throughout the end times.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   By faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   Anytime you and I begin to have confidence in our flesh,
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   that's when you're in trouble.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   That's when you are in trouble,
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   because you're one step away from the Israelites saying, "We don't need him."
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   Go through the motion, the desperateness, the sense of urgency to cling to him has gone,
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   because pride has come in, and we think somehow we can.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   In 2 Timothy 2, 11-13, it is also a trustworthy statement.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   "For if we died with him, we will also live with him.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   If we endure, we will also reign with him.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000]   If we deny him, he will also deny us.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   If we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself."
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   I mean, what he says here is a perfect example of Israel's history.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   God made a covenant, a unilateral covenant, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   And when they sinned, they saw the consequences.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   The enemies came and conquered them.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   And so when they denied him, judgment came.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   And yet, they were faithless.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   God still remained faithful, because he made that covenant.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   So the only thing that keeps us connected to this God is by faith.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   By faith.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   Do we believe this God?
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000]   Are we connected to this God?
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000]   Are we abiding with this God?
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.000]   Because the only strength that we have for us to persevere is by faith.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000]   That's why our confidence is not in man.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000]   That's why we don't run to human resources.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   That's why we don't simply copy what we think is successful out there.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   We just do what the Word of God says, in season and out of season.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   And let God's children hear the voice of Christ, and those who are his will follow him.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000]   That's our ministry philosophy in a nutshell.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   Because it's not in me, it's not in you, and it's not in them.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   It's in Christ, and Christ alone.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:55.000]   So my prayer is--again, I ask the praise team to come up, to take a few minutes to pray.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   That we would take some time to reflect and pray, where is your confidence?
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000]   Who do you run to when things go wrong?
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   Where do you find your greatest comfort?
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000]   What are you seeking?
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000]   Are you asking God? Are you seeking him?
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000]   Is he your refuge?
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000]   Is he your ultimate hope?
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000]   Have we put our confidence in man?
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:24.000]   So again, as our worship team takes some time to lead, let's take some time to reflect and to pray
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000]   and recalibrate our hearts, where Christ and Christ alone will be exalted.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   So let's take some time to pray.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:38.000]   [Prayer is sounded]
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   [Prayer is sounded]
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:58.000]   [Prayer is sounded]
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:08.000]   [Prayer is sounded]
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   [Prayer is sounded]
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:28.000]   [Prayer is sounded]
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:38.000]   [Prayer is sounded]
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:48.000]   [Prayer is sounded]
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:27:08.000]   [Prayer is sounded]
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000]   As we sing our closing praise, would you please stand with us again?
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:18.000]   [Pause]
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   [Music]
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:47.000]   I once was lost in darkest night, yet thought I knew the way.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:57.000]   The sin that promised joy and light had led me to the grave.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   I had no hope that you would own a rebel to your will.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:17.000]   And if you had not loved me first, I would refuse you still.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:28.000]   [Music]
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   But as I ran, my help and grace, indifferent to the cost,
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:47.000]   you looked upon my helplessness and led me to the cross.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:56.000]   As I beheld God's love displayed, you suffered in my place.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   You bore the wrath, you served for me.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.000]   Now all I know is grace.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000]   Hallelujah!
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.000]   Hallelujah!
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   All I have is Christ.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:23.000]   Hallelujah!
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000]   Jesus is my life.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000]   Hallelujah!
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000]   All I have is Christ.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000]   Hallelujah!
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   Jesus is my life.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:30:05.000]   [Music]
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:14.000]   Now Lord, I would be yours again and live so all might see
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:24.000]   the strength to follow your commands could never come from me.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:33.000]   Oh Father, use my ransom lap in any way you choose.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:45.000]   And let my song forever be my only boast, it is you.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:50.000]   Hallelujah!
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.000]   All I have is Christ.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.000]   Hallelujah!
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000]   Jesus is my life.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.000]   Hallelujah!
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:14.000]   All I have is Christ.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.000]   Hallelujah!
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   Jesus is my life.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000]   Hallelujah!
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   All I have is Christ.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.000]   Hallelujah!
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:44.000]   Jesus is my life.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   Let's pray.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:55.000]   Heavenly Father, we come before you humbled, in desperate need, Lord God, of your grace.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.000]   Lord, as you promised, that your grace is sufficient for us.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:08.000]   Help us, Lord God, to come to you before we seek family, friends, leaders,
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000]   to recognize, Lord God, that you are truly our only hope.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.000]   Help us, Lord, to build a church, build families, Lord God, build relationships,
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000]   centered around the only hope that we have in Christ.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:27.000]   So we pray, as you send us, help us, Lord God, to open our eyes to see the darkness around us,
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:34.000]   that we would not covet the world and what they have, and the experiences that they experience.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000]   Help us, Lord God, to covet eternity, to covet what Christ has,
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.000]   so that we would spend our days longing and waiting for the coming of Christ.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000]   So wherever you send us, help us, Lord God, to be a light,
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000]   especially, Lord, as you have given opportunity now,
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000]   that so many people have their eyes opened in asking,
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000]   there must be something more to life than this.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000]   Help us to stand between that gap and to be a witness to them, wherever you send us.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:10.000]   God sent his Son.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:15.000]   They called him Jesus.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:24.000]   He came to love, heal, and forgive.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:34.000]   He lived and died to buy my pardon.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:44.000]   An empty grave is there to put my Savior in.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:54.000]   Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:04.000]   Because He lives, all fear is gone.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:14.000]   Because I know He holds the future.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:27.000]   And life is worth the living just because He lives.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:34.000]   All right, again, if I can have this side of the room go out that door, and then this side this way. Thank you.
