[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.980]   - All right, just like we did before,
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.620]   once we begin our prayer time,
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.020]   we're gonna move the white chairs
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.000]   and then we're gonna have some time to pray on the ground.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.740]   So if you are planning to pray, to do that,
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.060]   we ask you to come sit up in the white chairs, okay?
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.680]   And then as we get started, again,
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.820]   like in the time we're just gonna move the white chairs out.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.500]   So if you're planning to do that, just sit there
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.720]   and then right before we get into prayer time,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.620]   we're gonna move the chairs,
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.380]   just kind of giving you a heads up.
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.940]   And just like before, we're gonna ask people
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.900]   who are gonna be praying,
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.120]   who want prayer from the leadership to come to the front
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.580]   and then we're gonna take some time to pray over you.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.140]   And then we have something at the end
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.340]   that we're gonna be praying for certain needs in the church
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.880]   and we'll kind of give you a heads up on that as well, okay?
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.740]   So if you are planning to just at some point,
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.900]   just kind of move down to the white chairs
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.740]   and then you can, we have carpets on the ground,
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.740]   so if you wanted to pray, we'll have that ready for you, okay?
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.340]   - Why don't we just take a minute or two
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.740]   just to gather our thoughts,
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.900]   to come before the Lord in preparation
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.820]   as we spend some time worshiping and praying.

[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:51.360]   - Let's pray together.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.560]   Father, we come before you,
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.440]   thankful that you gathered your church
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.640]   to come and pray, to acknowledge that you are Lord,
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.240]   that you are God, that you are gracious to us,
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.060]   that we are undeserving of your mercy.
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.120]   Father, I pray that as we spend time tonight praying,
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.800]   soften our hearts, Lord God,
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.440]   with all the distractions around us, Lord God,
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.560]   help us focus our attention to what we're doing tonight.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.160]   Lord God, as we sing,
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.000]   let our hearts be engaged in the words that we sing.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.680]   As we pray, as we spend time individually coming before you,
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.680]   help us, Lord God, know what to pray and how to pray.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.800]   Lord, fill our minds with things
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800]   that are needed in our lives,
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.120]   spiritual things, Lord God,
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.640]   that we may not have been focused on.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   Lord, as we pray diligently, earnestly, with zeal,
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.040]   and as we pray for those things as a corporate body,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.520]   Lord God, soften our hearts, break us, Lord God,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.240]   to see what is around us.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.040]   Help us not be fixated upon our own lives,
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.480]   but help us to see what you see around us,
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.360]   the people you placed in our lives,
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   the things, Lord God, that need to be saturated in prayer.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.760]   So, God, I pray that this night may be a night of blessing,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.760]   a night of communion with you,
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.040]   and that you continue to bless the body of Christ,
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   this church, Lord God, as we worship and pray to you.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.760]   So we entrust this time to you,
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.240]   asking for your grace again.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.040]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.600]   Let's all stand together as we sing.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.040]   Again, we're going to spend some time
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.960]   worshiping our God,
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.520]   and then it will lead into individual prayer
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.000]   after Pastor Peter gives us some encouragement.

[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.620]   (bell tolling)
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:58.800]   Let me read the text with you from Ephesians chapter six,
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.140]   verses 10.
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.800]   Finally, be strong in the Lord
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.200]   in the strength of his might.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.640]   Put on the full armor of God
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.640]   so that you will be able to stand firm
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.080]   against the schemes of the devil.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.200]   For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.160]   but against the rulers, against the powers,
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.000]   against the world forces of this darkness,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.040]   against the spiritual forces of wickedness
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.420]   in the heavenly places.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.520]   Therefore, take up the full armor of God
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.220]   so that you will be able to resist in the evil day,
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.040]   having done everything to stand firm.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.800]   Stand firm, therefore,
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.480]   having girded your loins with truth
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.480]   and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.000]   having shod your feet with the preparation
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.680]   of the gospel of peace,
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.120]   in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.000]   with which you will be able to extinguish
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.480]   all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.800]   Take the helmet of salvation,
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.220]   the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.040]   With all prayers and petition,
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.120]   pray at all times in the spirit,
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.440]   and with this in view, be on the alert
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.080]   with all perseverance and petition for all the saints.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.160]   Pray on my behalf that utterance may be given to me
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.480]   in the opening of my mouth,
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.080]   and make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:13.920]   Let's pray.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:20.740]   Father,
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.480]   help us to cut through
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.340]   our facade,
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.480]   our religiousness,
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.340]   our desire for presentation over substance.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:41.760]   Lord, reveal with your word and your Holy Spirit
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.340]   that we would be naked before you.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.660]   Search us, Lord God,
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.180]   for any hidden sins,
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.460]   any compromise,
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:59.640]   any hardened hearts, any bitterness,
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.700]   any evil thoughts,
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.800]   anything, Lord God, that we have not surrendered to you,
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.780]   that your word and your spirit would search us,
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.840]   that our prayers, Lord God,
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.520]   will be truthful and honest and desperate.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.040]   We pray that your word would teach us,
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.080]   reveal to us,
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.720]   rebuke us, challenge us.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   Help us, Lord God, in our weakness to pray
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.860]   with all prayer, with all the saints,
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.100]   with desperateness.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.940]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.840]   How many of you
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.280]   would honestly confess
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.880]   when the Bible warns us about having a form of godliness
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.620]   yet no power?
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:04.400]   How many of you will say that that is the case
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.720]   and yet you've been in that situation for years?
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.940]   You go through the motion, you do what you're supposed to do
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:22.340]   but you know that you have picked and chosen what is easy
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:27.320]   and you have held for yourself what is difficult.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.320]   You're willing to do what God calls you to do
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.000]   as long as it doesn't disturb your life too much,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.080]   as long as you can maintain your life
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.260]   and still serve the Lord.
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:49.020]   And as a result of that, you have held on
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.540]   to a form of godliness and you do not know the power of God.
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:57.480]   I would say many of us would probably confess
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.700]   that that is the case.
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:06.960]   We ask ourselves and we need to ask ourselves,
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.580]   do you really believe?
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:13.580]   Do you really believe that the son of God
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:23.500]   came off of his throne and gave up everything
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.760]   that you and I may have life?
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:33.100]   And if you believe that, do you also believe
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:39.340]   that he will come as a conquering warrior
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.900]   to separate the sheep and the goat,
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.960]   to judge the righteous and the unrighteous,
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:52.180]   to distinguish between those who genuinely believed
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:58.100]   and those who held on to form, a religiousness?
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:03.820]   That Christianity has made your life a better life.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.980]   Because you made some friends.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.020]   It gave you hope.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.640]   It taught morals.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.000]   It gave you purpose, community.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.280]   But you cannot honestly confess that Christ is Lord.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.740]   Not Lord over what you've chosen to give him.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.980]   Not Lord over the things that are convenient.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.320]   But Lord.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:38.000]   Have you ever said to the Lord,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.460]   here am I, send me.
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:46.380]   And actually meant it.
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:54.760]   Have you ever confessed, say you are my Lord,
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:26:00.920]   Lord over all things, and actually meant it?
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   And you're not Lord over all things,
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.120]   but you're Lord over all things.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.160]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.960]   You're Lord over all things.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.000]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.800]   You're Lord over all things.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.840]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.640]   You're Lord over all things.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.680]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.880]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.000]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.040]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.080]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.120]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.320]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.520]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.560]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.760]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.

[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.800]   And you're not Lord over all things.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.800]   And yet the angel of light can come
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.800]   in the context
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   of the culture of the community.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   When we're deceived to think
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.800]   that the cultural
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   Christianity is the Christianity.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.800]   And that the church
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.800]   as a whole could be deceived.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.800]   The church as a whole could be deceived.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.800]   And headed down
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   the path of judgment.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   It is Satan comes
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   to deceive us.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   And we are warned to stay alert.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.800]   1 Peter 5, 8, "Be sober
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   in spirit, be on the alert.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.800]   Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   seeking someone to devour. But resist him
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.800]   firm in your faith."
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   2 Corinthians 2, 8-10
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.800]   "The lawless one at the end
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.800]   will be revealed."
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   Meaning the work of the lawless one,
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   the Antichrist is working.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.800]   But in the end times it would be made
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   clear where that line is.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   How much of
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   what we do
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   is real?
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.800]   How much of what you believe
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   and practice
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.800]   is real? Or
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   have we created a form
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.800]   of Christianity?
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.800]   A subculture of Christianity?
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   Well we're no longer wrestling to know
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.800]   the truth.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   And to practice the truth.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.800]   And embrace the truth.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.800]   When we pick
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   and choose what is convenient for
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   us and what is easy for us.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.800]   We have created a Christianity
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.800]   that is no longer Christian.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   It's a subculture
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.800]   of Christianity
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   that helps us
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   with our life.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   Our existing life.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.800]   The life that we had before we met Christ.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.800]   Christ just
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   helps us.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.800]   So that we can be happier.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.800]   Safer. Live longer.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   Healthier.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   But it's not a new life.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   Because it is not a surrendered life.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   Do we
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   actually believe
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.800]   that all this is
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   going to be gone?
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.800]   That we're just
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   sojourners just passing through?
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   There's a reason why
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.800]   he tells us to
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.800]   watch out and stand firm
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   of the scheme of the devil.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   The scheme.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.800]   When we think of evil
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   we think of Hitler. We think of
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.800]   mass murderers. We think of rapists.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.800]   We think of things
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   that you and I cannot imagine
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.800]   doing.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   But the devil is much more clever than that.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   He uses the term
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.800]   scheming
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   because when he is
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.800]   effective we don't know.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   When
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   there is malware
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   when you have people
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   who are targeting you to get money
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.800]   that they don't deserve
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.800]   spam doesn't come
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   with red lights.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   Spam doesn't come
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.800]   to try to get you to click
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.800]   so that they can take your information and rob you of money.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.800]   It comes
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.800]   in a friendly form.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   Hey John. Hey Peter.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.800]   I have something for you.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   And it tempts you
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.800]   so that you click it.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.800]   And when you've taken the bait
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   you've
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   succumbed.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.800]   That's why he uses the term scheming.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.800]   Scheming that tempts you
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.800]   cause you to click. Cause you
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   to go down that path and next thing
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.800]   you know you're being compromised.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.800]   And you have a form
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   but there's no power.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.800]   The biggest hindrance to the power
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.800]   of God in a Christian's
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   life is himself.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.800]   It's not your neighbors.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   It's not the community. It's not the people
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.800]   around you.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.800]   It's yourself.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   Ourselves.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   And so we are
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   encouraged and warned
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.800]   like Paul
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.800]   says to Timothy
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.800]   don't entangle yourself
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.800]   in civilian affairs.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.800]   So that we may
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   please our commanding officer.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.800]   Meaning that we're at war.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   We're at war.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   There's souls at stake.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   There's people who are lost.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   Under the power of darkness.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:23.800]   So a Christian cannot live as if he doesn't
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   know that.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   Christian cannot make his greatest
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   priority
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   the length of his life.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   A Christian
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.800]   cannot live his life
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   with his greatest priority the safety of their
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.800]   own children.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.800]   A Christian who's opened his eyes
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.800]   to know the
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   reality of heaven and hell
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   can no longer in his right conscience
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   live
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   as if
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   that's not real.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   Either
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.800]   you believe that and you give your life
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   to spread the gospel.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   To save lost
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   souls.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.800]   Or
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   honestly confess that you don't believe
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.800]   this.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   Be honest with yourself.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   Confess
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.800]   you don't believe it.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.800]   I don't believe it enough
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.800]   to give up my life.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   I believe enough
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.800]   so that I can go to church
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   and be a good Christian, cultural Christian.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   Not enough to take up the cross.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   Not enough
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   to lose my life that I may
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   find it in Christ.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.800]   There's no different levels of Christianity.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   Either we believe or we don't
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.800]   believe.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   Are we living
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.800]   as if we're in war?
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   Are we praying
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.800]   like we're in war?
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   Are we desperate
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   like we actually have an enemy
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   attacking us?
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   Are we
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   crying out to the Lord?
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   Because we really
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.800]   believe that these souls are headed to hell.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   Or have we been blinded by
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   cultural Christianity?
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   Because that's all
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   you see around you.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.800]   So it has become normal
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.800]   to be dull.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   It's become
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.800]   normal
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   to go through the motion.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   But it's not real.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.800]   That's not real faith.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.800]   We need to pray
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   because there's a battle
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.800]   going on.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   We need to pray
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   because
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.800]   many of us have succumbed to the
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   scheming of the devil.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.800]   We've already succumbed to it.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.800]   We need to pray
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.800]   that God would open our eyes
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.800]   so that our faith is real.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   That we don't repeat
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   cultural Christianity.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   I guarantee you
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   one generation
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.800]   that lives
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   cultural Christianity
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   next generation is apostasy.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   Apostasy.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.800]   That's a proven
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   observable fact
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   in Christian history.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   If you accept
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.800]   cultural
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.800]   Christianity as your norm
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.800]   the next generation
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   will walk away from their faith.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:13.800]   I want us to pray
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   with a sense of
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.800]   urgency.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   With honesty.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   Don't
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   sit in your chairs
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.800]   and pray
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   because it's time to pray.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.800]   So that you can say
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.800]   that you prayed.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   Pray
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   because you're desperate.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   Pray
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   that God would open your eyes
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   so that
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.800]   you can see what he sees.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.800]   That he had compassion
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.800]   for lost souls.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.800]   Imagine the compassion
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   of our father.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.800]   That he would send his
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   only begotten son to suffer
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   for people
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.800]   who would crucify him.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   Imagine
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   what he must have been feeling.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   Imagine
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   what he must have seen.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.800]   Imagine
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   how desperate we must have
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   seen to him.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   That the only path
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   of salvation was to
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   have his son suffer
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   in his hands.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   That you and I may
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   have this life.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.800]   And then imagine those same
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   people who
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.800]   sing the songs and praises
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   of what he has done
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.800]   and then live
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.800]   like
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.800]   the rest of the world.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   Imagine how he must
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   grieve.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.800]   Imagine how
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   he must ache.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   Imagine
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   how he must hurt.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.800]   Imagine how he must be angered
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   by an apathetic church
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   who has held on to a form
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   of godliness
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   with no power.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   Pray with me.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.800]   Cry out with me.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.800]   We are more desperate than we know.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.800]   You may not see
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   the consequences of it tomorrow
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.800]   or the next month
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.800]   but eventually you will see
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.800]   the consequences.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.800]   You will see the consequences.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.800]   If we continue
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   to have a heart
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.800]   that is cold.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.800]   If we continue to play around
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   with the things of this world.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.800]   If we continue to hold
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.800]   on to form
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.800]   without real worth.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   Eventually you will see
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.800]   the effects of it.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.800]   Maybe not tomorrow
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.800]   maybe not next month
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   but you will see it.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   In your next generation.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   In the church.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   As I mentioned
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   before we go into prayer.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   Jesus warned the church.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   I have this against you.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   I have this against your first love.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   He said if you do not turn
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.800]   if you do not repent
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   I will take away your lamp stand.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   The lamp stand is the church.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:45.800]   That doesn't mean he is going to shut the doors.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   Doesn't mean that the name
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.800]   community church isn't going to exist.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.800]   But we would no longer
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.800]   be useful to the kingdom.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.800]   And I want you to imagine
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.800]   even if it's just for a minute
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   that we decided
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.800]   to shut this church.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.800]   Starting
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   this Sunday
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   there is no Berean community church.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   There is no bible study.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.800]   There is no college ministry.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   There is no retreat.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.800]   What will you cling on to?
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   What would Christ mean to you?
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:33.800]   What would you believe?
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   Would you still pray?
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.800]   Would you still study the bible?
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.800]   Would you still evangelize?
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   He said that a church
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.800]   that is no longer
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.800]   passionately in love with Christ
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.800]   is a church
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.800]   that is no longer passionately in love with Christ.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   In his eyes
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   it is no different than a church
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.800]   that has shut down.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:13.800]   We are not responsible
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.800]   because you and I do not have the power
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.800]   to turn sinners
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.800]   from their sins.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.800]   But he did warn us
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   that if
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.800]   I tell you to tell a sinner
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   that his judgment is coming
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   and I'm telling you to warn them
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   and you do not warn them
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.800]   and they do not turn
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.800]   that sinner will be
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   responsible for his sins
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   but you will be
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.800]   responsible for your callousness.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:45.800]   For not telling them.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.800]   But if I tell you
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.800]   to go tell a sinner
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.800]   to turn from his sins
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   and you warned him
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   and they didn't respond
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.800]   so that sinner
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   will be responsible for his sins
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   but there will be
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.800]   no guilt on you.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   Let's take this
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   challenge seriously.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.800]   Our church is growing.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:25.800]   [Silence]
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.800]   He didn't
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.800]   send us here just to grow.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:35.800]   We didn't establish this church just so that we can grow.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:41.800]   This church is here
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   because we need to be a light
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.800]   in this dark world
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.800]   and not just in Irvine.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   The world.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.800]   I
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.800]   need
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.800]   our church
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   to commit to Christ.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.800]   We need
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.800]   this church to commit
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   to Christ.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.800]   We cannot
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.800]   stay open
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.800]   if Christ
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.800]   is not our passion.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.800]   If Christ is not
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   our love. If Christ
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   is not our Lord.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.800]   Because we're just playing
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.800]   a game.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.800]   Pray with me.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.800]   We are far
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.800]   more desperate than we think.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.800]   This
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.800]   is far more urgent than you think.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:45.800]   We are far more
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.800]   vulnerable than we think.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.800]   Your children
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.800]   are in far more danger
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.800]   than you think.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.800]   We need to pray.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.800]   We need to pray
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.800]   with urgency.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.800]   Pray as if our
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   life depends on it.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.800]   Pray for the
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.800]   lost souls.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   This evening
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.800]   I'm going to ask you to pray.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.800]   And I'm going to ask you to pray
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.800]   for someone
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   very specific.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.800]   That do not
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.800]   know Christ in your life.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   Don't just pray
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   a peppered prayer.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   Lord, save
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.800]   this person. Save my mom. Save my
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   dad.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.800]   Pray as
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   if they're on their deathbed.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   And this is it.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.800]   Seek him with all your heart.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.800]   Pray.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   Commit to fasting.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.800]   Pray.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   Pray with urgency.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.800]   I want you to think
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.800]   of someone in your life that you
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.800]   love who do not know the Lord.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.800]   That may be
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.800]   your children. It may be your mom.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.800]   It may be your dad.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.800]   It may be your sister. It may be your brother.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.800]   It may be a cousin.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.800]   It may be a co-worker.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   But somebody you genuinely care about
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.800]   who does not know the Lord.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.800]   And plead
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.800]   on their behalf.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.800]   Because they don't know how to
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.800]   pray.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.800]   Because their eyes have not been open.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   They don't know the danger
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.800]   that they're in.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.800]   They don't know the love that is waiting for them.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.800]   So they cannot pray.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   But that's not you.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   That's not you.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:43.800]   So let's pray specifically
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.800]   for them.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   After you've prayed for them,
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.800]   ask the Lord
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.800]   to open your eyes.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.800]   And to pray for those
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.800]   who you may not love.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   But that
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.800]   God would give you enough love
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.800]   to pray on their behalf.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   Pray for
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.800]   the souls that you met out in Korea.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.800]   Pray for your co-workers.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.800]   That you have compassion for.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.800]   And even
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.800]   beyond that, ask the Lord to
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.800]   soften your heart to pray for strangers.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   Pray
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.800]   and plead on their behalf.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   Knowing
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.800]   and believing
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.800]   you know what is waiting for them.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.800]   And then, pray
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.800]   for those who you do not
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.800]   want to pray for.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.800]   Pray for those who have hurt you.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.800]   Pray for those who you've been bitter at.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.800]   Ask God
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   to give you the strength and the love
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   enough to pray for those
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.800]   that you've been resisting.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.800]   And to really pray.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.800]   So this evening,
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.800]   I want to challenge you.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   Don't just casually pray.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.800]   Don't just put
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.800]   in the time to pray.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.800]   Don't just go down a list to pray.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.800]   Figure out
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:13.800]   figure out the urgent things.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.800]   And
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   plead. Don't just ask.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.800]   Beg.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.800]   Plead.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.800]   Pray out.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.800]   So that our God knows how important
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   this is to you.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.800]   Pray in such a way
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.800]   that when God hears our prayers
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.800]   that He knows how
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.800]   desperate you are.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.800]   Pray in such a way
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.800]   where He understands
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.800]   how important
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.800]   this is to you.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.800]   And a God who promised
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.800]   and said, "If you abide in my word,
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.800]   I'll abide in you."
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.800]   Ask whatever you wish and it shall be done for you.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.800]   And cling to that promise
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   and pray.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.800]   That we may see the power
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.800]   of God. That God
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.800]   would deliver us from a form
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.800]   of godliness.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.800]   That we may participate
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.800]   in His power.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.800]   So I'm going to pray for us.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.800]   I'm going to give you time to pray.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.800]   And you can spread out if you want.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.800]   You can pray with other people if you want.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.800]   If you need someone to pray for you,
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.800]   then you can come up and we'll take some time
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.800]   to pray. But please
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.800]   do not pray casually.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.800]   Pray with urgency.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.800]   Let me pray
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.800]   for us and then we're going to have
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.800]   the music just
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.800]   kind of play. And again, like I said,
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.800]   if you are sitting somewhere
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   where you're self-conscious about
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.800]   what other people are going to think of you
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   if you pray, then get out of there.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.800]   Go somewhere where you're not going to
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.800]   be distracted and pray.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.800]   Heavenly Father,
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   we want
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   your glory,
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   not the praise of men.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   We want
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.800]   true peace,
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.800]   not just a safety net.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:09.800]   We want true life,
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.800]   not just superficial happiness.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.800]   We want
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.800]   true hope,
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.800]   not just wishful thinking.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.800]   Help us to see the weightiness
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.800]   of what it is
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.800]   that you've given us.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   Help us, Lord God,
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.800]   to see that our struggle
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.800]   is not against flesh and blood,
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   that we are in spiritual battle.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   If we've been entangled
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.800]   in civilian affairs,
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.800]   Lord, deliver us.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:49.800]   If we've been coveting the world
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.800]   more than coveting your grace and love,
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.800]   Lord, deliver us.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:57.800]   Lord, if we've succumbed
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.800]   to the scheming of the devil,
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.800]   open our eyes, Lord God,
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.800]   that we may cling to you and flee
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.800]   the devil.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   Help us to be a church
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.800]   that isn't just
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   known for studying the Bible,
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.800]   but is known,
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.800]   Father God,
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.800]   for men and women who pray,
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.800]   who pray desperately.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:25.800]   Help us, Lord.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.800]   The harvest
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.800]   is plentiful,
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   yet the workers are so few.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.800]   Raise up true workers
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.800]   for your kingdom.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   Help us, Lord God,
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.800]   to pray.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.800]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.800]   Help us to move our chairs,
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.800]   if you can help us to move all the chairs.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   And then again,
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.800]   we're going to take some time to pray.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.800]   And then in about 15-20 minutes,
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.800]   I'm going to invite
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.800]   those of you who want prayer
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.800]   to come up and pray together.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.800]   (Praying in Tongues)
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.800]   (Praying in Tongues)

[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.800]   My name is Cam. This is my wife Claire.
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.800]   And as many of you may know,
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.800]   we have a four-year-old son, Asher.
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:04.800]   So about less than two years ago,
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:08.800]   my wife Claire, she started to have a stabbing pain on her chest.
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:11.800]   And we did a lot of tests, but did not find anything
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:15.800]   until about last September.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.800]   She started to have, like, an extremely severe back pain,
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:23.800]   and we went to a lot of tests.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:26.800]   And later that day, last Thanksgiving,
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:31.800]   we find out she has a tumor on her chest,
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.800]   which caused her to have a spine fracture.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:42.800]   So since then, we went through a lot of rounds of chemo and radiations.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:53.800]   And recent tests show--SCAM shows her tumor continues to spread.
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:36:02.800]   So she will start her new clinical trial next Wednesday.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:07.800]   And we are so grateful that since then we received so many prayers
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:14.800]   and help and support from church brothers and sisters.
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:18.800]   Recently, my wife, she read the Gems, Chapter 5,
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:25.800]   and she see the power of prayer or faith from righteous persons.
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:31.800]   So we humbly and boldly ask for more prayer today.
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:39.800]   We ask for prayers, like, first, to have God be glorified through this,
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:45.800]   and for us to be a good testimony for his love and grace,
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:57.800]   and secondly, to keep us continue to have peace and joy from God
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:07.800]   in any circumstance, and to protect from losing hope or anything like that,
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:14.800]   but instead to continue to have thanks and praise to the Lord,
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:21.800]   and to always remember his word that there's nothing too difficult to the Lord,
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:31.800]   and last, to pray for her complete healing and protect her from all the side effects
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:38.800]   that we don't know.
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:40.800]   Thank you.
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.800]   I feel I'm unworthy to sit here and share,
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:52.800]   but recently, Lord has taught me that we as Christians should not hide,
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.800]   but be light to the world and around.
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:00.800]   So I think I should step out of my comfortable zone.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:07.800]   During the sickness and treatments, there are many--to be honest,
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:11.800]   I experienced a lot of closeness and God's presence.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:18.800]   I'm so thankful, and there are many peaceful moments.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:23.800]   Majority of the time, I feel very peaceful,
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:30.800]   that when I can sincerely boast in Christ and sing,
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:38.800]   "We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed, perplexed, but not disappearing,
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:44.800]   persecuted, but not abandoned, struck down, but not destroyed,
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:52.800]   because I have the most treasure in my earthen container."
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:57.800]   There are also times when I can do nothing but cry out to Lord,
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:01.800]   "Please do not cast me away from your presence.
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:04.800]   Do not take your Holy Spirit from me,
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:09.800]   because I am scared and I am so in need of you."
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:14.800]   There are times I confidently proclaim that I belong to Christ
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:18.800]   and the evil has no power on me.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:22.800]   There are times, like last night,
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:26.800]   when I cannot stop coughing for hours to get some rest.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:31.800]   I can only let the tears down and whisper in my heart,
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:37.800]   "Are you still there? Please help me. Please save me from this darkness."
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:41.800]   I quickly repent and confess my unbelief.
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:46.800]   I know God is my portion. There is no Savior except Him.
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.800]   Sometimes I feel, I feel in so many ways,
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:58.800]   in the disease, my physical health, my planning and ability to do things,
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:01.800]   and even my accountability to others.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:05.800]   Sometimes I just feel everything is still fine.
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:10.800]   I can laugh, plan and do things, especially for my lovely kid,
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:13.800]   and celebrate each day before Lord.
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:17.800]   I am weak. I am sick.
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:22.800]   I really pray and hope and plead and cry to the Almighty
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:33.800]   and mercy for God to save me with His divine healing thoroughly and speedily.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.800]   But I also am very grateful.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:45.800]   There are so many things to testify and glory God in each step.
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:51.800]   I still trust in Lord. I know our God is good.
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:58.800]   And His thoughts toward us and me is thoughts of peaceful.
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:11.800]   And Christ is my perfect Savior that can save me from both things and sickness.
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:16.800]   I shall still praise Lord regardless of anything.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:23.800]   And actually praise brings me a lot of strength.
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:30.800]   I need your help and many prayers because the Bible tells us
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:34.800]   the prayer of faith shall save the sick.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:41.800]   The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man alleviates much.
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:50.800]   At last, I hope to end this sharing with Psalm 27, verses 1.
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:54.800]   The Lord is my light and my salvation. Who should I fear?
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:42:01.800]   The Lord is the defense of my life. Whom should I dread?
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:10.800]   Praise the Lord and thank you all for your prayers.
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:19.800]   Before we pray, you know whenever we pray for someone who is sick,
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:27.800]   especially as sick as Claire is, there's always this reluctance that
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:30.800]   what if we pray and God doesn't answer?
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:38.800]   And so as a result of that, we kind of have a tendency to pray and covering just in case.
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:46.800]   When we pray, we pray with confidence because we are assured of two things.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:52.800]   One, that our God is capable, that our God is powerful.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.800]   For God to heal this is nothing to Him.
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:03.800]   He who did not spare His own Son, how will He not along with Him give us all things that are necessary?
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:10.800]   And so one, we know that God is more than capable of moving mountains if He desires.
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:12.800]   That we know for sure.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:19.800]   Two, we know He loves her. We know He loves Khan.
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:24.800]   We know He loves Asher. That we are confident in.
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:29.800]   And so when we pray, we pray with confidence that He is able.
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:34.800]   We pray with confidence that we are praying for somebody that He loves.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:40.800]   And that whether He answers or not, we are in a place where we can plead.
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:46.800]   We want this. Right? We want this. We want this to be His will.
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:49.800]   We desire this to be His will.
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:55.800]   And so in the end, God hears us and what He does with that, that's up to Him.
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:59.800]   But when we pray, we pray with confidence. Right?
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:04.800]   Because we are praying to a God that if it is His will, that He can.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:07.800]   And we want this to be His will. Right?
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:10.800]   So we are going to pray for them.
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:15.800]   And first of all, I want us to all pray collectively before I pray.
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:21.800]   Before the elders lay hands and pray for her, I want all of us to take a few minutes collectively.
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:25.800]   Not only is the prayer of righteous people like this God answer,
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:29.800]   but He also hears the prayers of the cries of the church.
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:34.800]   And so we are many in this room, so let there be many crying out on their behalf.
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:37.800]   This young family with a young child at home.
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:42.800]   And every single one of you who has a child at home, you know.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:45.800]   You know how urgent this prayer is.
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:47.800]   So let's pray. Okay?
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:49.800]   Take some time to pray.
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:52.800]   And after a few minutes, if I can ask the elders to come.
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:55.800]   And we are going to lay hands on Claire.
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:57.800]   Lay hands on her. Okay?
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:00.800]   And after about a few minutes of praying, right?
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:04.800]   And then afterwards, about 3-4 minutes, then I am going to lead us in prayer.
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:07.800]   And then our praise team is going to come up and we are going to close out the night.
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:09.800]   Okay? Let's pray.
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:34.800]   [Praying in the Spirit]
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:46:03.800]   [Praying in the Spirit]
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:32.800]   [Praying in the Spirit]
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:53.800]   [Praying in the Spirit]
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:47:22.800]   [Praying in the Spirit]
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:30.800]   Father, we thank you that you have given us a church community.
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:34.800]   We can come around, Father, this young family with Claire.
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:39.800]   Lord, you know that they have been wrestling with this for so long.
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:44.800]   And I know that they are fatigued, they are tired, they are scared.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:50.800]   Lord, I pray that you would hear our prayers collectively.
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:53.800]   That you would hear our crying out.
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:58.800]   That this precious sister, Lord God, is in need of your healing.
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:03.800]   Lord, I pray that this would be an opportunity to show your glory.
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:08.800]   Your power, Father God, that our faith would be strengthened because of her.
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:15.800]   That our whole church, Lord God, would have greater faith, Lord God, because of your healing upon this sister.
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:20.800]   I pray, Father, we know that you are more than capable.
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:26.800]   Lord, if you have been waiting for us to pray collectively, to cry out to you.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:32.800]   Lord, we are crying out to you now.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:39.800]   Lord, I pray for her, I pray for her husband, Con, I pray for Asher.
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:44.800]   Lord, as you love them so much that you gave your only begotten Son.
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:48.800]   That you didn't even spare your own son, Lord God, for them.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:54.800]   So how much more, Father, we believe that you desire what's best for them.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:57.800]   Lord, you told us to pray in faith without doubt.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:02.800]   So we pray, Father God, that you would bring healing, demonstrate your power.
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:07.800]   That we would celebrate and worship and honor and glorify you.
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:10.800]   Strengthen their faith, Lord God, that they would not be tired.
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:12.800]   That they would not be weary.
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:19.800]   I pray that all that you have promised in your scriptures, Lord God, will become a reality and not just wishful thinking.
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.800]   And so we lift her up to you, Father God.
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:26.800]   We lay hands, Father, because we desire this collectively as a church.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:34.800]   We cry, we beg, we plead together, Father God, for healing that only you can give.
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:41.800]   In the name of Jesus Christ we pray, Amen. Amen.
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:46.800]   So I pray that you continue to pray for her and her family.
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:49.800]   So if you can all stand up with me for our closing praise.
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:50:12.800]   [PAUSE]
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:17.800]   As we sing this last song, "Abide," as we've been so encouraged,
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:22.800]   we know, Lord, we know that we are unable to sustain ourselves.
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:26.800]   That it's through Christ and through him alone that we are able to abide.
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:31.800]   So as we sing this song, I pray that it may be not just a song we sing, but a prayer as well.
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:46.800]   [PAUSE]
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:51:07.800]   [MUSIC]
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:17.800]   For my waking breath, for my daily breath,
[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:26.800]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:37.800]   For the sun to rise, for my sleep at night,
[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:47.800]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:52.800]   You're the way, the truth, and the life.
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:57.800]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:02.800]   I'm the branch and you are the vine.
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:15.800]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:25.800]   When the spirit leaves, as I'm falling,
[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:35.800]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:45.800]   For the victory's still in front of me,
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:55.800]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:52:55.800 --> 01:53:00.800]   You're the way, the truth, and the life.
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:05.800]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:10.800]   I'm the branch and you are the vine.
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:15.800]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:20.800]   Be my strength, my song in the night.
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:25.800]   Be my all, my treasure, my prize.
[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:29.800]   I am yours forever, you're mine.
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:34.800]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:53.800]   When I pass through death, as I enter rest,
[01:53:53.800 --> 01:54:02.800]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:12.800]   For eternal life to be raised with pride,
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:20.800]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:25.800]   You're the way, the truth, and the life.
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:30.800]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:35.800]   I'm the branch and you are the vine.
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:40.800]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:45.800]   Be my strength, my song in the night.
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:50.800]   Be my all, my treasure, my prize.
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:55.800]   I am yours forever, you're mine.
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:55:00.800]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:05.800]   Be my strength, my song in the night.
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:10.800]   Be my all, my treasure, my prize.
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:16.800]   I am yours forever, you're mine.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:22.800]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:27.800]   Let's pray.
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:32.800]   Father, you're so good.
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:34.800]   You're gracious to us.
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:37.800]   You've shown your love towards us.
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:42.800]   You continue, Lord God, to show your faithfulness to us.
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:46.800]   Lord, help tonight not be a night that we pray urgently,
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:51.800]   Lord God, but may it continue throughout the days and months
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:54.800]   and years as you establish this church.
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:59.800]   Help us, again, see the world as you see it.
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:06.800]   Help us to have spiritual eyes, spiritual wherewithal, Lord God,
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:10.800]   that we are in the midst of a battle, a spiritual one.
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:15.800]   And the way, Lord God, that we participate is through spiritual means.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:19.800]   So I pray, Lord God, for strength for each and every one of us
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:23.800]   to rely on your spirit's power to sustain us,
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:28.800]   to move us forward individually and as a church.
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:32.800]   God, we pray for your name to be magnified,
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:34.800]   that the light of Christ may be shown brightly
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:41.800]   through each and every one of us who call you Lord and Savior.
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:47.800]   Again, Lord God, do almighty work for the magnification of your name.
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:55.800]   Provide healing, provide strength to those who need healing,
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:58.800]   especially for our sister class.
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:02.800]   Lord God, we know that you are a God who is good,
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:10.800]   and we trust that you will do good things in your timing, in your ways.
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:14.800]   Just help us, Lord God, just to be tools in your hand to honor you
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:22.800]   and give you the glory, the majesty, the honor that you're due.
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:25.800]   Again, be with us, Lord God, as we depart.
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:27.800]   Strengthen your church the only way you can.
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:30.800]   In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:52.800]   [silence]
