[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Let's pray.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your grace.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   God, we thank you for the challenge that's in your word.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   I pray, God, that every single one of us would have really moldable and fertile soil in our hearts.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   God, that we receive your word and be challenged by it.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   We thank you so much, Saint Christ, and we pray. Amen.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Okay.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   So, I'm going to try this out.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Oops.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   All right.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Okay, if you turn to your handout, I just want to give a really fast -- oh, sorry.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Give me a moment as I turn this TV on real fast for our viewers at home.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Okay.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Okay, so real quick, giving some Bible study tips.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Pastor Peter went over in week one the overall inductive study.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Today, all I'm going to do is just say, just remember that as you do your Bible study,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   it's always important to follow the flow of thought by following the syntax.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Okay.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Pastor Paul is a very logical writer.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   If you notice, he connects his thoughts together.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Oftentimes, he'll give even examples.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   He'll give illustrations from the past, et cetera, et cetera, and you want to identify those relationships.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Ah, this is an example, right?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And what I want to say is that from both paragraph to paragraph and then sentence to sentence,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   clause to clause, word to word, you want to find and identify what kind of relationship is this.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And one helpful tip that I found was just to understand what kind of relationships are there
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   and what identifiers can you see.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   So, for example, even within our text, here we have this idea for this reason, right?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And when you see that, you should be writing or at least jotting down on the side that this is some kind of causal relationship, right?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Because he's saying this is the reason.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   So, with that said, other markers of relationships show you purpose.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   For example, verse 10, "So that," da, da, da, da, and it shows you purpose.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Other times, certain prepositions show you the context, show you what kind of relationship it has.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And so what I like to do is when you take a text like this and read it,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   sometimes you aren't able to immediately see the relationships that exist.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   But what I did for you here is just to show you the different kinds of relationship markers that are present in this passage.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And what I did is take this and put it into an outline form using specifically these words.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And what I mean is to look at it this way.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Each one of those identifying markers that I saw, or at least the relationship words,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I used that to break off that segment of the passage into an outline form.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   But what I'm going to do now is just read it with you guys, and then after we read it, we'll walk down the passage together.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   So, it says, "For this reason also, since today we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will, in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   strengthened with all power according to His glorious might.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   For the attaining of all steadfastness and patience, joyously giving thanks to the Father,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light."
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Okay, I should say "who" right there.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   So, as we take a look at that, what I want to show you is this.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   By looking at these specific terms, I'm simply able to say, okay, this is clearly a transitional section asking the cause, right?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Or the reason. So, what is this reason?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   "I identify the main independent clause, 'We do not cease to pray for you and to ask.'
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Here is the content of your prayer, that you may be filled.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Here is the purpose, so that you would walk in what kind of manner or how in a manner worthy of the Lord,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   and what intended result for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience."
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   So, I went through that pretty quickly. Let's slow down and go through verse by verse.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   So, if you would take a look at the handout for today.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   If you guys don't have a handout, we do have some extra at the table in the back.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   As we take a look at this verse, where it says, "For this reason also, since the day we heard of it,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask, that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   in all spiritual wisdom and understanding."
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Now, just as in the previous weeks, I'm going to go through this fairly quickly.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   At any point, if you guys do have questions, I know it's a big room and stuff,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   you can either text me or you can raise your hand and ask.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   But as we think about this, we do have to answer the question, "What reason is this?"
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And if you recall, last time that we studied, he said, "You know what I heard about you?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I heard that you guys had..." This is the audience participation part.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   "You guys had faith, love, and hope."
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   And Pastor Peter called it the trifecta, the general characteristics of Christian faith.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   They had faith, love, and hope.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   So what Apostle Paul heard that these individuals actually already exhibited
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   attributes of a genuine Christian.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   That many people in the congregation had already expressed and maybe even borne fruit
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   of the faith within.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   But upon that, I want you to think about this, Apostle Paul then was even more inclined to them pray.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And so what a challenge for us.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   That his heart is to pray that these saints would not simply be,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   "Oh great, you named Christ? You're good."
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   But rather he was praying for them unceasingly.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And then it's a challenge for us as a model for us, like,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   the content of the unceasing prayer,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   the burden of the mind of wanting to have fullness of the Christian faith.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   That it does not simply rest on, "I heard the gospel in its simple form,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   and I don't want to hear anymore."
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Rather it's actually, he says, "That you may be filled."
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   The content is that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   and in all spiritual wisdom and understanding.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   So we have to ask this question then,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   if the content of his prayer is to be filled with this knowledge,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   what is this knowledge?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   How does it relate to these terms of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   So those are probably some questions that you guys had.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Why does he use three synonyms for the same concept?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Well, typically when you see that, it's a point for you.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   This is like a slow down, take a look, and understand what he's trying to say.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   That a high, high priority for every single one of us as Christians
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   is that we would be ever growing in the knowledge of God. Amen?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And what's more, the relationship that you see
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   within knowledge, wisdom, and understanding,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   what kind of relationship do you see among those three terms?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Did anybody discuss that in your groups and want to share?
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I'm not looking for a specific answer here,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I just want to know what you guys talked about.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   So for those three terms, what is the relationship that you see?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Anyone? Yes?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Oh, okay, nice.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Very good.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So, you guys hear that, right?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   He had a nice voice that carried, so you guys kind of heard that.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Good, good.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Any other thoughts about how the concepts here relate to one another
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   as what he is praying for for the congregation? Yes?
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Okay.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Okay, great, excellent.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Good.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Combining both ideas, right?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   The prayer here is that all of it, all of God's will, right,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   that God reveals, Apostle Paul is praying that you guys would all have,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   the church would have it to the full.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   In terms of the church receiving it, you're absolutely right.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   There can't be this, "I know that it's there in my Bible on my shelf."
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   It can't be outside of you.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   It's got to be in you, yes?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   You have to receive it, and of course you have to apply it.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And so as you think about that, Apostle Paul is praying,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   those terms have a specific nuance to it.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Knowledge in terms of its doctrines and facts and truths.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   The actual wisdom, wisdom typically means skill to use it,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   skill in life, right?
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   The understanding comes from perception, like you've not only simply read it,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   but now your mind is actually changed by it because you actually understand it.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   It's become a part of your understanding, right?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   So in this way, Apostle Paul wants so much more
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   than just simply having doctrine on paper.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   And just as a point of conviction to us,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   isn't that what many people are annoyed by?
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   If a group of people believes like, "We're better because we know,"
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   but that knowledge is external to them on pieces of paper,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   that's when people are like, "What is that?"
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   But it's when actually the knowledge becomes a part of us because we received it,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   because we've applied it, and with wisdom, with understanding,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   we can see how it operates, we can see how God is wise, right?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   That affects us and changes us.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   And just as another point, there has always been that classic, classic versus
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   where somebody has said, "You know what?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   We don't want to be overly emphatic about doctrine.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   We don't want to go overboard on that level."
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   That's kind of a false dichotomy when people say,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   "Oh, we're about heart versus knowledge."
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Apostle Paul is very clear. You can never do too much of the truths of God.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Why? Because he wants you to be full.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   The issue is, but have you actually wisely applied it?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Have you gone thorough to maturity?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   That's the issue there. Okay? Good.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   So as we talk about that, Apostle Paul, his prayer is that we would be full,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   we would be filled with the knowledge of God.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And that then becomes the platform.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   That then becomes the base by which he says the next part,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   which is the purpose.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   The purpose and the manner.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   He says, "So that you would be filled, so that you will walk
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   in a manner worthy of the Lord."
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Man, if you just take a moment to think about a manner worthy of the Lord,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   immediately it's like, "Oh my goodness, that standard is so high."
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   But then Apostle Paul describes, I don't know if you guys saw it this way,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   there was a rapid fire succession of short clauses to please him in all respect,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   strengthened with all power according to his glorious might.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   So let's take a moment to think about that a little bit.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   If I was preparing a sermon, I would just do it this way and say,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   "The challenge and command is you need to walk, right?
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   You can't have your theology just in your head. You need to walk. Apply it."
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   And then we'd talk about, "Hey, but these are the character traits.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   This is the categorical description of what that worthy walk looks like."
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And then we'd go down the list. Boom, boom, boom.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Now for the sake of time, I'm going to lump those into two categories.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   One, let's just talk a little bit about being pleasing to him in all respects,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   and the other, being strong or strengthened,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   where you're bearing fruit, you're increasing,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   and you're strengthened with his glorious might.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   We take a moment to think about this idea.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Scripture actually calls every Christian.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   You need to discern what is pleasing to God and what is not.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   We as believers have to be experts.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   We have to be experts at this is the standard of God, and this is substandard of God.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   If there's anything we're pro at, where we could become really, really sufficient at tasting,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   "This is going to be pleasing to the Lord. This is not pleasing to the Lord."
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   It doesn't even have to be an explicit direction or prescription from the Bible,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   but even the atmosphere of it, you know, "Ah, I don't think he's going to like this."
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   It's we who should know that, right?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   As we spend time with the Lord and we're aware of his will, that's what we need to be.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And, you know, it actually so happens that many of you guys,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   a lot of times when you go shopping or something like that and you have a close friend,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   you pick up a shirt and you're like, "Dude, this would look perfect on her,"
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   or, "This would look great on him. This is so his style," right?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   You should be the first one when you see something, it's like, "That is so God's style," right?
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And on the contrary, if you see something clashing, we should be the first one to be sensitive to that, right?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Now, on the next half of the description where it talks about bearing fruit, increasing, and strengthened,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   we could go at length talking about that.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   But I want to just simply give some challenging words here because right now, okay,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   I don't want to be ignorant of the fact that we do live in a generation where this topic of strength,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   whether we're growing and bearing fruit or not, is actually kind of a hot topic.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   What am I talking about?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   There are these spokespeople who go out and college campuses talk about, "This is male masculinity," right?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   You guys have heard that kind of stuff?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And then you have opposing sides like, "No, that is toxic."
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And then you have individuals who talk much about, "You know what? We are a generation. We're so insensitive.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   People need to recognize I'm hurt."
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   And then we have other people who are like, "No, you just need to do the right thing. Suck it up."
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Like there's all this debate going on right now, and the climate is really, really hostile.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Well, one of the discussion questions I'm going to ask you is,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Apostle Paul says, "A manner by which you should walk is that you should be bearing fruit, growing and increasing,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   and you should be strengthened with all power."
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   And there has to be an evaluation of us like, "Hmm, where am I?
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Do I have a mental vision of what it means to be empowered by Christ?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Do I have a mental vision of what it means to be empowered by knowing God's will?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Do I have a vision of what it means to be empowered supernaturally by the gospel?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   What does that power look like?"
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   So here's an interesting thing.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   We're talking right now about a way that is pleasing to the Lord,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   and we have to ask, "What is pleasing to the Lord in this description?"
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Well, in this description, what's pleasing to the Lord, it is an individual who is not passive,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   but he's actively applying his faith and is bearing fruit.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   He's not giving excuses. He's not grumbling, but rather his increasing in wisdom, his increasing in knowledge.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   And I think if this would be a controversial statement to make,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   it is displeasing when the individual is perpetually weak.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Did I say it the wrong way? Did I say it the right way?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I want you guys to think about that, and then you guys can discuss within your groups.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   I left that for a discussion.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   How do we balance? Because I will be the first one to confess.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   I have many weaknesses in my life, and 1 John says, "If I say I didn't have it,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   then I would be a heretic and a liar," right?
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   So do we have to acknowledge that we are weak? Yes.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   But what's also clear is we do not lower the standard of God.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   As Christians, we are to strive for the strength that is found in the person of Christ.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   And there is a supernatural power for believers to go above and beyond what is natural,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   what is just simply explicable for the rest of the world, right?
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   So we have to learn to talk about that.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   So that's what I'm going to leave for your discussion.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Any questions about that so far?
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   All right, so I hope you guys kind of understand the way I'm outlining here,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   that I'm seeing those all as descriptive characteristics of the manner worthy of the Lord.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And then as we follow along in the next passage, what we find is that as he goes from a walk
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   in the manner worthy of the Lord, it goes through all of this, right?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   When you walk in this fashion, and it's based on the truths that you understand about the will of God,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   that is going to be for, it has an intended purpose or actual intended result that he expects within you.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   The whole process of growth, I like the way that you guys described it,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   there is a process of growth right there.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   From God revealing, us receiving, us supplying,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   that process of growth should result in steadfastness and patience with joy.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   What's more, it should result in thanksgiving to the Father.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   It should result in thanksgiving to the Father.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   So, this is really important because as you guys remember the context,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   this small church, right? This small church.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Apostle Paul is so overjoyed that the fruit of the gospel,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   the power of the gospel that's been going forth is bearing fruit in them.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   But he also sees from out there and over here, there are attacks coming.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   There are the attacks of the legalists, there are attacks of the Gentiles,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   there are attacks of the self-deprivation guys,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   asceticism. Am I saying that right?
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Okay, thank you. I can't say the word for some reason.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   There's a bunch of people who believe in self-deprivation,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   don't touch this, don't do that, and you deprive yourself.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   It's a hard word to say for some reason, I can't say it, but you guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Later on, we'll see that there's these attacks inundating the church.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   And so Apostle Paul says, "I want to have this full process be evident in all of you,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   so that the result will be not only that you're going to be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's here!'
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   But there's going to be strength inside of you, and there's going to be steadfastness,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   there's going to be patience underneath that, and it's going to happen joyously
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   as you give thanks to the Lord." Right?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   As I say this, if you guys remember, several, several weeks ago,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   it might have been some time ago, I preached a passage called, you know, "Raising the Bar,"
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   because God really raises the bar on us with this.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   The expectation, yes, it's clear, God expects us to have a growing knowledge and content of faith.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   But if you think about what He is thinking of as a result here,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   He's thinking about much more than saying, "Oh gosh, I'm hurting and broken,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   I just wish you would, you know, comfort me and understand how bad it is."
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   No, He's actually designed for us to have such a strength.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   He's praying for us that we would be so rich in the knowledge of God
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   that we would come out of those trials, of course, not stoic and robotic,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   but actually giving thanks to the Father.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   That's really raising the bar, isn't it?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Okay, so we went through the passage there, and I hope that was an encouragement to you.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Oh, you know what I forgot to do?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Is check my messages for questions you guys had.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   So you know what? Actually, there's some that came in.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   I do want to answer just a couple because I'm pretty sure many of you guys had it.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Oh, this is a good one. There's about three people who asked this question.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Joyously, I put it in my thing here too.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   If you guys look here, it says, "For the attaining of all steadfastness and patience,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   joyously, aka with joy, giving thanks to the Father."
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   These are the moments when it's good for you to check different passages,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   meaning different translations of the Bible.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   So the ESV will say, "With joy."
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   The NIV will actually put it, "With thanksgiving," and say,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   "Joyously giving thanks to the Father."
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   The NSB kind of did a weird thing where they put a semicolon right there.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And the reason why is because remember that in terms of the numbering of the verses
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   came 1500, 16th century, and it wasn't like original to the text.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   And so sometimes the verse pointing is also kind of like,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   "This is where the punctuation marks are. I think this is where it stops."
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   It's just that in the original manuscript, I believe, "With joy" is "meta caras,"
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   which is "with joy."
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   So I take it like it should be actually tied with steadfastness and patience,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   that your steadfastness and patience has your attitude of joy with it.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   You bring that attitude of joy to your suffering, that kind of mentality.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   But whichever way it goes, it's kind of the same idea here.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   You're either in suffering joyously giving thanks to the Lord,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   or through the suffering too, you're expressing joy to the Lord
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   as He's carrying you through those situations as well.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   All right. Great.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Then, are there any other questions that you guys have of the passage for tonight?
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Okay.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Then, just want to conclude with going over some of the discussion questions with you guys.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Okay. So I'm done with my PowerPoint here.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   A couple of discussion questions with you guys.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Please take time now to discuss with your group.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Number one, as we discuss the various characteristics of a worthy walk,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   what are some inspirations for you?
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Those are broad, broad terms.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Pleasing to God, bearing fruit, increasing in knowledge, and strengthened.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   As you read those things, what elements are challenging and inspiring to you,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   and in how so?
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Also, that question of weakness versus strength.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   It is important for you.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   If you guys didn't get a chance to talk about it, talk about it.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   What does it look like for a Christian to have power?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Does it mean I have beams coming out of my hands?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   What does it mean to have power?
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And therefore, then, how do we balance?
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   You have weaknesses in your life.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   How do you balance that with the expectation of the Scriptures
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   where God calls to live by the might of the Lord?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And then, the next question is just a personal assessment to you.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   I know you guys are sometimes feeling like, "Oh, man, this question is getting really personal."
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Well, if you guys feel like, you guys can go to a different room.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   But here is this question.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   As you evaluate your life, is there any area that you are already aware of?
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   You can only tackle the stuff you're aware of
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   where you have settled for a standard less than God's.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   You know this isn't pleasing to the Lord, but you've settled for it.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   It's something to confess and talk about with each other.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   And then, the last part is, because the main clause is Apostle Paul praying,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   praying and asking for this church,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   how does that challenge your prayer content and your prayer practice?
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   As you compare what Apostle Paul is constantly praying for,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   and as you compare what you're constantly praying for,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   how does that challenge you?
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   Okay, let's pray, and then you guys can break up to your groups.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Lord, we thank you so much for your grace,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   and we thank you, God, again, that your word is so challenging to us.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Father God, we thank you that, Lord, you are changing us.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   And who we are in our natural state is not who you're going to leave us be.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   But, God, that your Spirit is working us, your word is at work in us,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   you're at work to us through the church,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   you are at work in our lives in so many different ways.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   And I pray, God, that we would continue just to humble ourselves
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   and continue to surrender and submit and to follow your lead.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
