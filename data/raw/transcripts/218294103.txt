[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   Okay, we're looking at today in Revelations chapter 2.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.640]   I was kind of tempted to go through Revelations chapter 2 and 3 together because I wanted
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.120]   to see the whole, all the seven churches in one cohesive study.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.820]   But in order to do that, we're going to have to just skim through a big chunk of what we're
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.400]   looking at.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.800]   So we broke it up in two parts.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.240]   We're going to do the first part today, chapter 2, the first four churches.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.760]   And then the second three churches we'll be dealing with in chapter 3.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.040]   So let me start and then let me pray, then we'll jump in.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:43.620]   Gracious Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have to be able to come and study.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.520]   We ask Lord God that you would guide and lead us, that this time would be fruitful.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.000]   Help us to understand the deep things, Lord God, that you've revealed to us, that we may
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.120]   live soberly, that we may consider, Lord, that this life is ultimately fading, that
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.080]   you will come to redeem your church, Lord, for eternity.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.720]   And for that end, we pray for insight.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.640]   We pray not simply for knowledge, but illumination, Lord God, that only you can give through your
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.640]   spirit.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.640]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.760]   All right, so before we jump in, I think we kind of have to, I can give you a heads up
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.320]   into how we're approaching this because we talked about before how the book of Revelation,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.840]   depending on which theological bent that you approach it in, it may cause you to see things
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.720]   in a very different light.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.040]   And I told you from the beginning that as we're going through it, I'm not going to have
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.760]   a particular bent.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.360]   We're going to look at the text and see if there's clear pointers that's going to point
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.040]   us to a certain direction.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.440]   And if it is, you may or may not agree, I'm going to point that out and I'm going to say
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.400]   this seems to be the best way to understand it, or at least it seems reasonable textually,
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.040]   and not to try to cram a meaning of the text based upon a larger theological picture that
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.720]   we've already committed to.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.200]   And so we don't want to approach the book of Revelation that way and then try to milk
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.160]   certain things because it fits better into our larger form of theology.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.120]   Well, beginning with these seven churches, if you have a dispensational bent and if you've
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.840]   been taught the book of Revelation with, again, a dispensational bent, you may have been taught
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.760]   that these seven churches are seven different stages of church history until he comes.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.040]   And then the last stage is the Laodicean church, which is the lukewarm church.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.000]   If you, again, if you read it like I did and studied it, even just this week, I don't think
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.760]   you'll be able to get that message unless you read, unless you already came in with
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.280]   that meaning, right?
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.720]   Unless somebody already told you and said these are the seven different stages of the
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.720]   church.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.400]   I don't think just plain reading will cause you to think, oh, these are, this is the different
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.840]   stages of church history.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.520]   So I'm not going to be approaching it like that.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.960]   We're going to look at each of the letters and what it says and how the early church,
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.280]   the recipients of the letters would have received it, what specific things are going on behind
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.200]   the scene that he would mention certain things like that.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.840]   But at the same time, that does not mean it doesn't have application to us or even in
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.200]   the future.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.280]   But we want to first and foremost read it in the way that they would have understood
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.280]   it.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.280]   Okay.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:39.160]   So jumping into, all right, jumping into the text, the seven churches we mentioned last
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.800]   time, you see these, we're going to start with Ephesus and we said that the order of
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.960]   the seven churches are just in order of this circle.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.720]   And there was a road that kind of connected each one of them anywhere from 30 to 45 miles
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.880]   apart from each other.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.680]   And so the reason why these roads connected was because every single one of these cities
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.680]   are major cities.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.120]   There was some kind of major trade going on or it has significance in the Roman empire.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.560]   And as a result of that, the population in these cities were probably larger than normal
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.960]   cities.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.080]   And that's the reason why the seven cities or seven churches are targeted.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.240]   So are these the only cities in this area?
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.240]   Absolutely not.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.040]   There's a whole bunch of other cities in this area, but these seven are mentioned because
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.980]   of the largest and its significance and its connection.
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.640]   So we're starting with Ephesus, right?
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:44.000]   The similarities in each of these letters, they all are addressed to the angel of the
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.400]   churches.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.500]   How many of you have heard before that the angel of the churches, that this represents
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.240]   the guardian angel that each church has?
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.520]   Have you ever heard that before?
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.520]   Okay.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.520]   Two of you.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.520]   All right.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.180]   So there is a discussion as to how do we understand these angels.
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.960]   So do we have guardian angels?
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.660]   Some people will say yes, some people will say no.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.000]   But the predominant understanding of this text is not necessarily that there's an angel
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.720]   over a particular church.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.880]   So every time somebody plants a church, that God sends an angel to watch over them.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.600]   And that is not, I mean, I'm not saying that that can't happen, but that's probably not
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.720]   the best way to understand this.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.360]   The word angel, angelion, basically means a messenger.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.200]   And most commentators will interpret this as a representative of an elder or a bishop
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.740]   over the church.
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.240]   So it's not necessarily writing a letter to a celestial being.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.800]   It's most likely being written to the elders or to an elder of this particular church,
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   right?
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.480]   Who in this case is called a messenger, somebody who's representative of this church.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.120]   Every single one of the letters, remember we studied that last week, that all the different
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:12.320]   aspects of Jesus's qualities, whether he had a blazing eyes of fire, he had a tongue of
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.040]   sword, he had a bronze feet burned, and he had all these different descriptions.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.000]   And we said that all of these things are going to take a role, play a role in how he is addressed
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   to each one of these churches.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.960]   So we're going to be looking at four of them today.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.920]   And why does he mention himself as a blazing eyes or the double-edged sword?
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.800]   And it has some significance to what he has to say to these churches.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.520]   So I'm not going to go over all seven of them, but each one of these churches begin by saying
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.280]   the son of God, you know, with the double-edged sword, and he'll mention something.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.240]   And there's a reason for that, and you'll see it in the rest of the letter.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.720]   So let's start with the Church of Ephesus, and we have a little bit more to cover than
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.080]   normal, so I'm going to go through it pretty quick.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.760]   Paul spent more time in this city than any other city in his missionary journey.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.760]   He spent over two years in this particular city.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.280]   And we also know that on his third missionary journey, when he was, there was a prophecy
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.240]   that if he goes to Rome, he's going to be captured and bound, and he was ready to go
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.680]   and basically give up his life to preach the gospel.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.680]   And the way he spent his last day before he got on this boat was to call the elders of
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.840]   Ephesus, and they said they stayed up all night, right, talking.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.560]   Just like, you know, any human relationship, they weren't going to see each other.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.640]   So when they were leaving, they said they were in tears because they were afraid they
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.120]   weren't going to see each other.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.720]   Well, the main content of the conversation they had that night, it records that Paul
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.360]   was warning them about the false prophets that are going to come in and try to deceive
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.600]   them.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:58.320]   And so there's a reason why Timothy, Paul's right-hand man, was sent to this particular
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.000]   church to help them to sort out this false doctrine.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.960]   Paul, again, one, because he had a particular heart for this city and this church, and so
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.640]   he wanted to make sure that his most trusted servant or disciple was going to represent
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.480]   him to make sure to sort this out.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.480]   So you can kind of see some of the things that he says, or his heart for the church
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.480]   of Ephesus.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.080]   Again, obviously, Paul's not the one writing this letter, but just the significance of
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.120]   this particular city.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.920]   It describes, on the third, that Jesus is described as the one who walks among the golden
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.920]   lampstand.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.780]   Therefore, he has very intimate knowledge of their good and bad qualities.
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:49.320]   So you can see on the surface, it begins by saying, you know, his commendation that they
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.880]   toiled and endured suffering patiently, that they did not tolerate evil in the church,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.680]   they tested and rejected the claims of the apostles, and then they hated the works of
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.120]   the Nicolaitans.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:08.040]   So on the surface, somebody who is observing this church from the outside will easily look
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.180]   at this church and say, "What a model church.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.080]   Everything that a good church should have, this church has."
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.520]   But Jesus isn't just somebody who's observing from the outside.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.160]   He's the one who's walking and standing in the midst of them.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.740]   In other words, he has very intimate knowledge of who they are.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.960]   He not only knows what's happening externally, he also knows what's happening intimately,
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.400]   inwardly, privately, what's happening in their hearts.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.000]   And so when he sees that, he brings that to attention.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.800]   Again, so the significance of recognizing Jesus in the midst of that and be able to
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.840]   understand all of this.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.440]   Now the sins of the Nicolaitans or the false teaching of the Nicolaitans are going to be
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.720]   mentioned throughout all of the seven letters or just kind of spread out.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:59.680]   And the Nicolaitan teaching, I mean, you know, you can fill in the blanks as I'm going over
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:06.360]   it, but the Nicolaitan teaching is basically a hybrid of Christian and Gnostics.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.800]   The early church, one of the main doctrines that was penetrating into the early church
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:17.680]   was from the pagan world was these Gnostics who were teaching that the flesh is evil and
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.680]   the spirit is good.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.220]   So Jesus Christ came and he delivered us from our flesh.
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:28.020]   And so when we die, we're going to be saved in our spirit.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.840]   So what you did in the flesh didn't matter.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:36.640]   And as a result of that, they basically were going around teaching that you can live licentiously,
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.480]   you can do whatever you want in the flesh, but you're still saved.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.480]   One saved, always saved.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:47.560]   So first John, the epistle of first John is written specifically to deal with this false
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.880]   doctrine.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.960]   So if you remember, if you've ever studied through first John, John mentions that he
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.940]   who denies that Jesus came in the flesh is not from God.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.400]   And that was a very specific teaching of the Nicolaitans.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.160]   Because the flesh is evil, the son of God could not have come in the flesh, that he
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.560]   only came and he appeared to be in the flesh, but he was always in the spirit.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.800]   And so that's why John deals with that particular teaching.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:19.600]   And so in the Jewish world, what was the primary heresy that was penetrating into the Jewish
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.880]   Christian world?
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.440]   The Judaizers, right?
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.480]   That you had to first become a Jew before you became a Christian.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:34.360]   In the Gentile world, the primary heresy were the Nicolaitans or the Gnostics, right?
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.060]   Or some kind of form of Gnosticism.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:46.280]   We don't know this for sure, but early church tradition tells us that Nicolaitans, their
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:52.720]   leader may have been Nicolnar, and he is mentioned as one of the leaders, you want to call them
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.960]   deacons, or one of the seven people that was chosen in Acts 6-5.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.760]   You remember that passage, Acts 6-5?
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.520]   This is where the Hellenist widows, right, they weren't being fed, and the apostles say,
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.280]   "Well, pick seven of you who are full of the Spirit with good reputation."
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.840]   And so seven deacons are mentioned in that particular passage, and Nicolnar was one of
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.840]   them.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:18.960]   So this is not for sure, but the early church tradition is that he was the one who led a
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:25.240]   large group of people to begin to practice this, again, Gnostic form of Christianity,
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.400]   which is obviously, it was the wrong gospel, right?
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.120]   And the reason why this was so popular is because somebody who had influence, who were
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.760]   inside the church, who was respected, was teaching these things, right?
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.600]   Somebody from the outside, nobody knew, started saying strange things, it wouldn't affect
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.880]   them, but it was because it was one of the leaders.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.760]   So if you look at the early church and the corruption and the different doctrines that
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.760]   they really wrestled with, it didn't come from outside the church.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.940]   It came from inside the church.
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.360]   Some of them were prominent leaders in the very beginning of the movement, but later
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.000]   on got influenced by the Judaizers, right?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.160]   So you know how influential the Judaizers were, because even James, Peter, and Barnabas
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.000]   was affected by them.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.080]   So Nicolnar, again, from the Gentile side, was an individual who had much influence in
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:21.200]   the early church, and he began to lead people astray, and so his teaching is not limited
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.280]   to this particular church, but you'll see that in all the other churches, or a lot of
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.600]   the other churches.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.040]   The warning that he gives them, right?
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.440]   Esther used to tease me because I used to preach on this so much early on when I used
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:41.080]   to preach, the three R's, right?
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:47.280]   He says, "You have abandoned their first love," and I want to just kind of highlight here,
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.760]   he doesn't say you have lost your first love, he says you have abandoned it.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.280]   It was not something that they just kind of, it just happened.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.760]   If you're a Christian for a long time, you just happen to lose your first love.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.040]   He says, "No, you have direct responsibility over this.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.520]   You have forsaken or abandoned your first love."
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:13.120]   The word for first in the Greek is "prodos," and it can also be, which means basically
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:20.120]   foremost, not first as in second or third, but first as in priority, and so another way
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:27.520]   to understand this is that they have lost the greatest, the most important love.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:33.560]   The word for love is "agapen," and I'm sure you know that word, which is a love that describes
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.680]   God's willful affection for man, so it was a willful love.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:44.720]   It was not just, the emphasis is not on emotion, but on the will, right?
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:52.800]   So this abandonment of the first love can be understood or commonly read as this is
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.280]   your affection for God, yet you're not as passionate as you were before, which obviously
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:04.360]   that's part of it, but the way that this was probably manifested was inside the church.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.360]   How was the passionate love for God manifested?
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.960]   So some of the commentaries believe that the emphasis in this passage is talking about
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.840]   love for one another, that they were on the surface serving God passionately, or at least
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.360]   on the surface doing everything that they were supposed to do, but the evidence that
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:27.040]   their love for God wasn't priority was in the way that they loved one another.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.320]   And I believe that most likely this is probably in reference to both.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.400]   He's not just talking about you forsaking your first love.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.840]   You're loving each other, you're doing great things for each other, but your passion for
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.680]   Christ has dwindled.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.920]   Usually those two things go hand in hand.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:51.800]   Usually if you lessen in your passion for God, there tends to be a direct effect of
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:57.240]   how you treat other people and how you relate to other people, and vice versa.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.400]   And that's exactly what God said too.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.360]   He says, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.300]   second is like it."
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:12.900]   You can't say that you love God and hate your brother because that would be a contradiction.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:22.380]   He said in John 13, 35, it says that they're going to know us by what?
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.000]   How will they identify us?
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.740]   By right doctrine, of course.
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.260]   How we live, all of these things are true.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:37.200]   But Jesus singles out the most important character that the world will be able to distinguish
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.300]   us from the rest of the world is love.
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.740]   Love for God and love for one another.
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.900]   And so he says, you're doing all of these things, but the most important part of what
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.300]   it means to be a Christian, you've abandoned it.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.080]   You have right doctrine.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.500]   You don't tolerate false apostles.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:17:00.380]   So everything that you're supposed to do, you're doing, but you've abandoned your priority,
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.380]   willful love.
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:10.680]   Now, I'm not going to linger here too long, but I think this is the beginning of the seven
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.880]   letters and in the beginning of these seven letters kind of sets the groundwork for what
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.180]   he has to say for the rest of the letters.
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:24.900]   Because Christ, who stands in the midst of the seven lamps, he's not somebody on the
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:30.260]   outside that you give a report and if on the report everything looks good, he says, "Okay,
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.260]   pass."
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.460]   He knows us intimately.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.460]   He knows me intimately.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.140]   He knows you intimately.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:40.360]   And what Christ wants more than anything else is worship in spirit and in truth, inside
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.740]   and out.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.140]   And that was the sin of this particular church.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:52.300]   They were doing everything right, but their priority, love for Christ, was no longer there.
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:58.660]   And as a result of that, he says, that if you don't remember and repent and redo the
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:05.440]   works you did at first, that the consequence of that is that they will no longer function
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.700]   as the light to the world.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.000]   He says he's going to take away the lampstand.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.780]   At the end of chapter one, he says the lampstand is what?
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.780]   The church.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:20.860]   So what does it mean to take away the lampstand?
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.340]   We are the light of the world.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.860]   Our whole identity to the world is to shed light and darkness.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:33.160]   So if he takes away the lampstand, what happens to the church?
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.940]   Is he saying he's going to come and literally shut the door?
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.480]   He's not going to allow us to worship anymore, that we can't gather?
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.740]   If he takes away the lampstand, does the church dwindle?
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.460]   Does the church shut down?
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.340]   No, you can still function, right?
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:55.820]   As long as people gather together, as long as there's a pastor and there's a place to
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:00.740]   meet and there's relationships in the church, the church will still function.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.360]   But when you take away the lampstand, he said the very purpose of why you exist will no
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.780]   longer be the reason why you gather together.
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.100]   You're no longer the light.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.740]   We're no longer shedding light and darkness.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.820]   So we can have all the things that a church should have externally, but internally, in
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:24.220]   the kingdom of God, it's become nothing more than a community with a name of Christ, but
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.860]   has nothing to do with Christ.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:33.820]   So think about the intensity of this consequence.
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.560]   He's basically saying your church is going to be useless if you don't restore your first
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.560]   love.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:44.800]   He's talking to a church who's doing everything right, at least on the surface, but who just
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.820]   kind of just coasting along.
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.520]   Their priority love is not there.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.920]   They're not passionate about it anymore.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.040]   They're just doing their job.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:20:01.320]   The consequence of that is that the church loses its purpose, right?
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.980]   So let that sink in.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:10.720]   I don't know about you, but it's very sobering to me that whenever I feel my heart or I see
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:16.880]   my life or my attention drift off to something else, the consequence of I can preach and
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.080]   I can do all these, you know, like do all the pastoral ministry, but in the end, if
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:28.460]   the Holy Spirit isn't in our midst and doing its work, it's all just men kicking against
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.140]   a goat, right?
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.520]   And that's what he says.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.240]   He warns this Ephesus church.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.400]   He doesn't say, "Hey, you guys are doing great things, but this one thing you guys should
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.400]   work on a little bit better."
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.400]   He doesn't say that.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.320]   He says, "You're doing all these things, but I have this against you."
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.800]   If you don't remember the height from which you have fallen, if you don't repent of where
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:53.040]   you are, and if you don't continue in that path that God brought you on in the beginning,
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.240]   then your church is going to be useless, basically.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.880]   Just a warning to the church of Ephesus, church of Smyrna.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:09.400]   It is the only one of the seven churches that still exists today in a modern-day Izmir.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.400]   Anybody ever hear about this before today?
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.360]   Yeah, the first time me hearing it too.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.360]   It's a small city.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.300]   It still exists.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:24.280]   Jesus is described in the opening of first and the last, who died and came to life.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:30.040]   Smyrna is one of two churches where there is no rebuke.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.400]   Anybody know the other one?
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.480]   Philadelphia, right?
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.560]   What are the qualities of these two churches?
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:42.080]   Now obviously you know this one.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.400]   Both these churches were known for intense suffering.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.000]   They were known for intense persecution.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.840]   So we're not going to do Philadelphia today, but the church of Smyrna.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.120]   He introduces himself as the first and the last.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:04.160]   Again, we talked about this last week, signifying the complete sovereignty of Christ, that even
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.480]   if suffering leads to death, he has power even over death and life.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:17.400]   He says, "Though you may be poor physically," he encourages them, "you are rich spiritually."
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:23.220]   You may not have all the riches of the church of Ephesus or Laodicea.
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.920]   In fact, Laodicea was the exact opposite.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.320]   This was a church that was thriving on the surface.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.320]   People were making money.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.320]   A lot of businessmen were coming.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.160]   So Laodicea was a very significant city at that time.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.480]   But he says exactly the opposite of what he says to this church in Laodicea.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:46.280]   This church had a reputation of being poor and down and out, but instead in Jesus' eyes,
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.280]   he says, "No, you're rich.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.120]   Your faith is thriving."
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.560]   The suffering in this church was intense, particularly intense.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.720]   And that term "synagogue of Satan," you're going to see that maybe about three or four
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.920]   different times in the various letters.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:11.360]   So when he says "synagogue of Satan," as the primary persecutor of the church, who is he
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.560]   referring to?
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.600]   The Jews, right?
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.200]   So the first persecutors of the church were the Jews who were offended.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.680]   And so Paul, every time he would go to missionary journeys, he would first go to the synagogues.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.560]   And I don't think that was unique to Paul.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.120]   I think all the apostles, when they went to evangelize, they would target the synagogues
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.840]   because the Jews would have been the first ones who should have understood the gospel
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.960]   because the gospel was in their law.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.400]   So the first persecutors, the first Christians were also Jews, but the first persecutors
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.580]   were also Jews.
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.480]   And when the persecution was intense, like these cities, you'll see the term "synagogue
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.480]   of Satan."
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.560]   So Abed, think about that.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.640]   We talk about it from a Christian perspective because we know that they're persecuting.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:02.320]   This synagogue, what was it dedicated for?
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.320]   For worship.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.320]   Of who?
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   Yahweh.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:10.320]   And then they did Sunday school for what?
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.240]   To obey the law.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.800]   And what was the law all about?
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.320]   Prepare them for the coming Christ.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:26.560]   So think about it that Christ himself is calling a gathering for the purpose of worshiping
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:31.560]   God as a synagogue of Satan.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.360]   That's no different than saying, you know, today's church, and we say, well, first Baptist
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:41.120]   church, you know, we say Baptist organization of Satan.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.880]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.680]   And a name that would have been equivalent to this is where all the God fears, people
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:55.320]   who come to worship God, people who wanted to honor God gathered together, and yet they
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.720]   were doing exactly the opposite.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.640]   They were doing Satan's work.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.960]   And Jesus said, "He who is not for me is against me."
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:12.160]   If you miss Christ and you're not in the part of the work of reproducing and being a light,
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.760]   you're part of this group.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:22.720]   And that's, again, that title he gives to not just this, but to many of the synagogues.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:28.200]   A great persecution, this area was known for intense persecution.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.440]   How many of you know about the martyrdom of Polycarp?
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.360]   I've mentioned them once or twice at church.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:40.560]   Polycarp's martyrdom is famous in the church because this was a very old man who lived
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.600]   up to about 70 or 80 years old.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:51.400]   And again, this martyrdom, this burning at the stake happened in this particular city.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:26:00.360]   And at 75 years old, they basically told him that if he does not denounce Christ, that
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:04.760]   they're going to burn him at the stake, and then basically the records show that the captain
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.920]   of the Roman guard pleads with him, "Old man, all you have to do is say, just say it, say
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.920]   the words."
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.200]   And to this end, he wouldn't do it.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:18.080]   And I remember reading his words back in college when I was reading about his, when he was
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.080]   being martyred.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:24.080]   And basically he says, "For 75 years, my Lord has been faithful to me.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.320]   What reason do I have now to denounce him?"
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.040]   And basically he said, "No."
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.360]   And after he says that, they were forced to burn him at the stake.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.740]   And even the Roman guards, you know, reluctantly had to carry out the sentence.
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:44.640]   So that persecution, that particular martyrdom happened in this city.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.180]   It didn't happen at the time of the writing of this letter.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.520]   It happened in 155 AD.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:55.960]   But again, it was, this city was known for heavy persecution.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.600]   And so that's why if you look at the letter, he says that even in death, right, he will
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.280]   conquer, that you will not suffer the second death.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.600]   Even if you suffer the first death, you won't suffer the second death.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.240]   Second death he's referring to is judgment in hell, right?
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.280]   Revelation 26, "Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.400]   Over such, the second death has no power."
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:20.520]   Third, the Church of Pergamum.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:25.440]   I'm going to go through these pretty quick because there's a lot in here.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.400]   Jesus is described as the one who has a sharp double-edged sword.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.400]   And we're going to get to that.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.800]   There's a reason for this, right?
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.700]   This city was given the right to carry out capital punishment on their own without having
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.560]   to get permission from Rome.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.040]   This right was called the right of the sword.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:51.240]   So you can see why Jesus is introduced as sharp double-edged sword, because this city
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:57.600]   was the only city in the area who, if they wanted to, can carry out capital punishment.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.400]   The reason why they were given this privilege and why, again, why persecution in this city
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:08.760]   was intense is because this city was given permission to set up the worship, the temple
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:14.040]   for the leader of Rome, Augustus, which was called the Divine Augustus and the Goddess
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.040]   of Roma.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:20.120]   That's what they called this particular temple.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:25.320]   So of all the seven churches, the church that would have had the greatest conflict with
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.720]   the Roman government was the Church of Pergamum.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:35.080]   So when Jesus is introduced to us as a sharp double-edged sword, again, when you think
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.960]   about the sword, you're thinking about battle and fighting.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:43.120]   So because the conflict with the Romans were so great in this city, Jesus basically says
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.280]   that he has a double-edged sword.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:50.960]   This sword is much sharper than the sword that the government, the authority has here.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:29:05.680]   He commends them that in the midst of intense persecution, that they remain faithful.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.160]   And he actually mentions a martyr in the early church.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:15.640]   His name is Antipas, that even in his martyr, that none of them yielded.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:25.200]   They remained faithful to the end.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.480]   He says, "Yet I have this against you, that you hold the teaching of Balaam."
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:35.680]   And again, he mentions teaching of Balaam and teaching of Nicolaitans later.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.240]   And teaching of Balaam, hopefully you guys had a chance to look it up.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:47.560]   In Numbers 22-24, Balaam's the one who basically seduces the Midianite woman to go and seduce
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:55.560]   the Israelite men so that they would have sexual relationship to corrupt them and then
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.720]   eventually get them to worship the Moabite idols.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.080]   And as a result of that, intense judgment comes upon the nation of Israel.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:08.680]   So basically what this letter is saying, the sin of this particular city was that they
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:14.600]   were allowing the teaching of Balaam to penetrate into the church and many of them were being
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:19.440]   seduced into idol worship.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.160]   So let me stop right here.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:28.720]   Because twice in these letters, at least in these four letters, it's mentioned that the
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:35.280]   teaching of Balaam and Jezebel and the false prophets and the prophecies and heresies were
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.560]   leading them to eat food sacrificed to idols.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.640]   But what does Paul say about that in 1 Corinthians chapter 8?
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.640]   About eating food sacrificed to idols?
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.560]   Turn your Bibles there to Romans chapter 8.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:58.680]   Not Romans, 1 Corinthians chapter 8.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.600]   Some of you guys may remember, some of you guys may not, but turn to 1 Corinthians chapter
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.600]   8.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:23.680]   Okay, I'm just going to read a portion of it just to get you to remember.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.560]   Now concerning food offered to idols, we know that all of us possess knowledge.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.720]   This knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.660]   If anyone imagines that he knows something he does not yet know as he ought to know,
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.000]   but if anyone loves God, he is known by God.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.280]   Therefore as to eating food offered to idols, we know that an idol has no real existence
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.320]   and that there is no God but one.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.960]   For although there may be so-called gods in the heavens and earth.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.520]   So he goes on and on, basically he says they're idols, right?
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.620]   They're not real.
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:55.080]   So the food offered up to them that is being sold in the marketplace, some people are saying
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.120]   that if you eat that, you're going to become unclean.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:05.000]   So there was this debate in the church that you shouldn't eat food offered up to idols.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:13.640]   Yet here it says the teaching of Balaam was leading people to eat food sacrificed to idols.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.400]   Is that a contradiction?
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.760]   You're saying no.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.760]   Why is it not a contradiction?
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:26.320]   It's not a contradiction because 1 Corinthians chapter 8 is talking about meat that has been
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:31.920]   sacrificed and then being sold in the marketplace like every other meat.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.840]   So they're saying because it was sacrificed it's unclean.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:40.980]   And what Paul is saying is that meat that was sacrificed at the temple and the other
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.600]   meat are no different.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.960]   So whether you eat, if you eat it with a clear conscience, it does nothing.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.800]   And then he says the problem is not the meat.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.120]   The problem is that it bothers people's conscience.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.240]   And if it bothers their conscience and you don't care about their conscience, then that's
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.960]   a problem that you don't care about your brothers.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.080]   Where Paul says if it causes someone to stumble, I'll never eat meat again.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.000]   So the issue isn't even about the meat.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.880]   The issue is being sensitive to the brothers and sisters that the context that you're in,
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   right?
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.480]   And we can apply that to drinking.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.360]   We can apply that to various other gray areas in our life.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.880]   But it's not even, it's not about that.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:31.360]   Here when he's talking about food sacrificed to idols, what is always mentioned with that?
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:53.920]   What is the other sin that is mentioned with food sacrificed to idols?
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.080]   Sexual immorality, right?
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.560]   The other sin that is always mentioned along with food sacrificed to idols in these churches
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:07.960]   are that this heresy is leading people to eating food sacrificed to idols and sexual
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.240]   immorality.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:14.440]   When you put those things put together and you understand the teaching of Balaam and
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:19.280]   the Nicolaitans is that basically they were teaching and leading people astray.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.760]   And what was the sin of Balaam?
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:30.360]   Basically to corrupt the men of Israel to cause them to worship idols, right?
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.980]   That was the sin that's mentioned in the book of Numbers.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:39.340]   So if you look at the sin, the heresy of Balaam and the Nicolaitans, their goal is to get
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.080]   you to worship these idols.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:47.000]   So the issue that they're dealing with here and in 1 Corinthians 8 is completely different,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   right?
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.320]   The issue that they're dealing with here is that this sin is leading them to false idol
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.760]   worship.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:35:00.120]   He's talking about these pagan rituals that these so-called Jewish men, Christian
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:04.800]   men were being led to participate in, right?
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.960]   So they would go to these temples, they would accept Christ as their Lord and then when
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.300]   one of their friends invites them to the temple worship because they grew up all their life
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.880]   doing this, they would go and join them.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.880]   And somebody in the church with wrong teaching would say, "Well, that's okay."
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.960]   So the Nicolaitans would say, "Well, that's okay because what you do in the flesh doesn't
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.960]   matter.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.960]   One saved always saved.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.120]   Christians aren't perfect.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.120]   We're just forgiven."
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:34.120]   And you have these cliche things and I'm sure that's not what they said back then, but you
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.960]   have similar teachings, "Oh, we have Christian liberty."
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.160]   I'm sure you've heard that term before.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.600]   And the Christian liberty that you see, the way Paul uses it is completely different than
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.720]   the way we use it today to justify any behavior.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.880]   It doesn't matter what we do because we have Christian liberty.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.980]   So the Nicolaitans were teaching this similar kind of teaching.
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.860]   It doesn't matter what you do in the flesh.
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.320]   So they were leading them to this temple worship.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.920]   So why would this have been so tempting?
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.480]   Because they had orgies.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.480]   Sexual immorality.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:14.080]   I mean, think about how difficult it is with sexual temptation even in our generation.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:18.120]   I mean, now I know how difficult it is because of the internet and how easily accessible
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.280]   it is.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.320]   Back then, all they had to do is walk into the temple.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:32.920]   And not only was this acceptable, it was expected of men because it was part of the worship.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:38.400]   If you were a good idol worshiper, you would go and engage in sexual relations with the
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.520]   prostitutes at the temple.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.720]   So imagine how difficult it would have been for Christians to come in and say, "This is
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:48.200]   something that they've been enjoying all their life," and say, "If you want to be a follower
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.920]   of Christ, this is immoral.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.920]   You can't do that.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.240]   You can only have one wife."
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.640]   You can't commit adultery.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.680]   That's committing adultery.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:02.000]   You can't unite your body with a prostitute or uniting the body of Christ with a prostitute.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.740]   You can't do that.
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:09.080]   So imagine how difficult it would have been, practically speaking, to get people to break
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.080]   away from this.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:15.720]   So the early church had these men or women who were teaching false doctrine.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.200]   They were trying to, you know, "Why can't we have it all?
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:24.160]   Why can't we be a worshiper of Christ and still enjoy some of this stuff?"
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:30.900]   And so they were embracing teaching that would allow them to do both, right?
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.680]   Which wasn't the gospel at all.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:36.160]   Does that happen today in our generation?
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.500]   Absolutely.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:45.360]   If a certain teaching is uncomfortable in your life, our tendency is change the doctrine.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.360]   Maybe that's not what it really says.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.640]   That's not what it really says.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.600]   So you can kind of live any way you want and still worship God.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:56.300]   And again, so that's what was happening in this church, right?
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.720]   You had the one extreme, the legalist, saying that you have to be a Jew.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.120]   And then you had the other extreme saying that you can pretty much do whatever you want
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.840]   and still be a Christian as long as you believe in your heart, right?
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.880]   In essence, that's what was going on, right?
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.520]   The warning against them, it says, "Unless you repent."
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:24.700]   And again, is he telling them to repent of that particular sin?
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:30.820]   He is, but who is this letter addressed to?
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:35.120]   To the faithful in the church, right?
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:40.560]   This letter is addressed to the faithful in the church who is looking the other way, who
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.540]   are allowing this to happen, right?
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.560]   So he's not talking to people who are already in sin and this letter is written to, "Hey,
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:53.400]   those of you guys who are hanging around the temple, you need to get back here and repent."
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.280]   He's talking to faithful who are persevering through suffering.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.040]   They were loving one another and they were doing all the right things, but I have this
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:07.280]   thing against you that you allow this to happen in the church, right?
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:13.420]   That you kind of, I mean, obviously the leaders are the most guilty because they're leaders,
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:17.220]   but every other person in the church that sweeps sin under the rug, whether, you know,
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:21.260]   I think the natural tendency in the church is, well, that's the church's responsibility,
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.260]   the leaders, right?
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.500]   Since I'm not a leader, I don't have to deal with that.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.100]   And every once in a while I hear somebody saying that.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.460]   When you have, you know, difficult things to deal with at church, it's like, "Oh,
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.460]   thank God I'm not a leader."
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:37.300]   Meaning, that's your responsibility, not mine.
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.420]   Now, obviously we have different degrees of responsibility.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:44.540]   If you're a leader in the church, we have different degrees of responsibility, but every
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:50.300]   Christian is responsible for their brothers and sisters in Christ, right?
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:54.820]   Accountability can't happen with a few people watching the church, right?
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.300]   Shepherding cannot happen with a few people shepherding the church.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.860]   That has to happen within the church with one another, right?
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.500]   So, you know, one of the things, again, I want to highlight is he's not simply, he's
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:11.020]   not talking to these pagans who are actively engaged in these things.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:15.580]   He's talking to faithful Christians who are just simply looking the other way, right?
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:21.860]   And he said, because of that, he said, "If you don't rid the church of this," he says,
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.940]   "judgment is coming."
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:28.900]   But to those who overcome, he said, "He will give hidden manna."
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.060]   Not referring to physical food, but to spiritual care, right?
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:39.060]   That God's going to take care of them.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.340]   And then he says that he's going to give them a white tablet.
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:47.380]   And this is very specific to this particular city.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.700]   Because of the relationship they had with Rome, it was a tradition of theirs to give
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:56.860]   a tablet, sometimes made of wood, metal, or stone, depending on, you know, the importance
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:02.220]   of the event, as sort of an invitation to a particular banquet.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:06.940]   So that would be equivalent to like a wedding, maybe, you know?
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:12.380]   And if you get an invitation from, and it's a very important event, that probably the
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:17.340]   invitation itself is going to be on nice paper, right?
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.340]   Calligraphy.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.740]   It's not going to be on crayon, right?
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:21.740]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:27.580]   You're not going to get an invitation to something really important scribbled on a piece of paper.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:32.980]   So in this particular city, because of the relationship with Rome, Rome had tradition
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:41.060]   of inviting people to special events, if it was really important, made of stone as an
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.060]   invitation.
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:47.600]   So what Jesus is saying is, "You may be shunned from society, and you may be afraid
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.100]   that you may not be able to eat or have business."
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:55.100]   And Jesus is saying, "No, I will give you the hidden manna that they don't understand.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:59.100]   I will give you the white tablet, invitation to my banquet that the world will not know."
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:04.820]   In other words, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:05.820]   unto you."
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:11.740]   Finally, the Church of Thyatira.
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:16.420]   We know the least about this city out of the seven, and yet we have the longest letter
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.980]   as to this city.
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:23.380]   Jesus describes himself as a son of God, having blazing fire, right?
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:29.380]   Typically, we think of a blazing fire, think about that Jesus is able to see with clear
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:37.460]   vision and feet like burnished bronze, that it's steady and firm.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:43.220]   And I mentioned to you how the book of Revelation has direct connection to the book of Daniel.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:48.300]   In particular, chapter 10 and 12 describes the coming of the Son of Man, and he is described
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:53.780]   in the exact same way, "Eyes of flaming fire and legs gleam of burnished bronze."
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:58.540]   And this is the reason why Jesus uses the term "Son of Man" to identify himself more
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:03.020]   than any other term, more than Son of God, more than Child of God.
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:07.060]   All of these terms are used, but Jesus declares himself the Son of God more than any other
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:13.460]   term because that particular term was a messianic term that was prophesied in the Old Testament.
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:17.500]   So every good Jew who knew his Bible would have understood that Jesus was saying, "I'm
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.940]   the Son of Man, Son of Man."
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.340]   When we hear Son of Man, we hear a child of a man, right?
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:29.540]   When the Jews heard the Son of Man, the way he was using it, he was basically saying the
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:33.660]   Messiah, the Chosen One, the Christ, right?
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:38.500]   So the term Son of Man is equivalent to Christ.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.140]   We don't know a whole lot about the city other than the fact that if you remember the
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:49.060]   prominent lady in Philippi, Lydia, who was a dealer of purple cloth.
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:55.020]   Purple cloth to us is just purple, happens to be cloth, it's not anything in particular,
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:59.820]   but at this particular time, purple cloth would have been like silk or a trade of gold
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.300]   or something very, very expensive.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:09.660]   So meaning that Lydia was probably a very wealthy businesswoman, very prominent businesswoman.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:13.340]   And so the only thing that we know about this particular city is that she comes from this
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:20.940]   particular place, right?
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:26.460]   The commendation for this city is that they had love, faith, and they had patient endurance
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:30.060]   through all the different trials.
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:37.160]   But unlike the Church of Ephesus, their love now was even greater than it was in the beginning.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:43.120]   So again, this was a great church on the surface, but one of the descriptions of Jesus that
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:48.460]   we mentioned is he is the Alpha and Omega, beginning and the end, right?
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.420]   Who walks among the seven lampstands.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.420]   So he looks beyond the surface and he's able to see more clearly.
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:59.320]   He said, "I have this against you.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:03.480]   You tolerate the woman Jezebel."
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:10.180]   Jezebel is a term that is often used to describe a woman who is very, very, very wicked.
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:16.820]   So if you were to choose one person in Israel's history who happens to be female, who represents
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:23.420]   idolatry, evil, anything hatred toward God, it would have been this woman Jezebel.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:31.020]   So this is probably referring to a very influential woman in this city, a prominent woman in this
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.880]   city.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:40.060]   I didn't write it here, but some, because of the description and because we know that
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:45.820]   Lydia happened to be a very prominent, well-known businesswoman who was very influential, some
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:52.180]   speculated that maybe this Jezebel is referring to Lydia.
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.860]   But that's complete speculation.
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:46:00.000]   They're just making a connection, right?
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   We don't know that.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.140]   So don't go out of this room and say, "Oh, Lydia is Jezebel."
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.140]   Don't say that.
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.140]   Okay?
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:11.460]   This is just one or two of the commentaries mentioned that maybe possibly, you know, her
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:18.380]   name is mentioned in the New Testament because she was prominent, just like Nicolai, who
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:25.060]   later on led the Nicolaitans out of the church, that maybe she was one of those people.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.060]   Don't know.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:31.360]   He says, as a judgment, he says it's going to cause her to be ill, tribulation is going
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:36.560]   to come, and that their children are going to be put to death.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.480]   Most likely it's not referring to their physical children, but as the New Testament uses often,
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:46.280]   it's referring to his followers, the disciples of Jezebel, who are rebelling against God
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.680]   and bringing stumbling block and suffering to the church.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.560]   That's the judgment that's coming.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:58.560]   But to those who stood against her influence, Christ promises authority over the nations
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.720]   and they will rule with a rod of iron.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:08.120]   And then three, he will also give them the bright and morning star.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:14.680]   You know, what's interesting is the bright and morning, the morning star in, I think
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.000]   in Ezekiel is in reference to Lucifer.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:25.840]   But in Revelation chapter 22, Jesus himself calls himself the morning star.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:29.040]   He says that he will make them a morning star, something shining and bright.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:33.960]   So Lucifer was called the morning star before the fall, that he was the most beautiful of
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:38.920]   all the things that God created.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:43.740]   So here he says, you're going to be elevated and your beauty is going to far exceed whatever
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:44.740]   you lose.
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:45.740]   Okay.
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:46.740]   All right.
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:51.240]   So those are the four churches and I have to go through it pretty quick or else, you
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.280]   know, we're going to take too long.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:59.800]   But I want to take a few minutes before I release you to your discussion groups.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:05.820]   As I already mentioned that most of the descriptions here, and obviously, you know, some of these
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.320]   things blend with one another.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:11.840]   There's some unique qualities of each particular church and some of them stand out, right?
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.960]   Obviously, the Church of Ephesus will stand out.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.800]   Laodicea stands out.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:22.120]   Smyrna and Philadelphia stand out because of, you know, there's not being any rebuke.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:29.960]   But the primary rebuke to these five churches in particular is not toward those who are
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.300]   rebelling against God.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:38.560]   The primary rebuke are the church members who are tolerating it and they're not speaking
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.560]   up.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:44.640]   And so the corruption in the church, obviously, the leaders are primarily responsible if they
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.200]   refuse to deal with sin in the church.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:56.000]   But every single member in the church, right, who allows them to tolerate sin is also guilty.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:05.600]   So there's a balance between grace and righteousness, His mercy and holiness.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:11.000]   And the church, when we talk about the cross or being gospel-centered, gospel-centeredness
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.800]   doesn't mean that no matter what people do, that we're gracious and we throw it under
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:24.000]   the rug because the cross represents His righteousness, His wrath being appeased because of His grace,
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   right?
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.600]   So if you take holiness out of the cross, then you don't have the cross.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.240]   If you take mercy out of the cross, you don't have the cross.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.240]   You have to have a perfect balance of both.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.440]   And that's what the cross was.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:41.600]   It was a revelation of His holy, holy holiness and also His grace.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:47.480]   So the church has to be a place where holiness is taken seriously, right?
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:51.840]   That it's not a gospel-centered church isn't a church that is okay that no matter what
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:55.880]   we live in, we just kind of sweep it under the rug because we're gospel-centered.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.600]   Sin is just not that big of a deal anymore, right?
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.880]   That is not the case, right?
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:04.380]   We need to be gracious with sinners who are repenting.
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:09.760]   We need to be merciful with sinners who are struggling in sin and that they are welcome
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.560]   so that we can struggle together.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:17.680]   But an unrepentant sin, right, a constant challenge to push the envelope so that the
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:23.160]   church looks more and more like the world, that we have to fight, right?
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.480]   And not just the leaders.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.040]   Every member in the church has to participate in that fight.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.280]   And again, when I say fight, I'm not talking about standing up and pointing out everybody
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.280]   else's sin.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.640]   I'm not talking about that, right?
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:39.460]   Because like I said, we need to be as gracious as we can be to repentant sinners because
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:42.440]   every single one of us are in the same boat.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.700]   We're all weak, right?
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:45.780]   We all need mercy.
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.080]   We all need grace.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:54.580]   But if we allow unrepentant sin to begin to penetrate into the church because we're afraid
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:51:00.180]   to deal with sin, then eventually the church becomes nothing different than the world.
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:03.300]   And eventually, what does he say, right?
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:09.660]   If he takes away the lampstand, then all of this is just a show, right?
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:13.460]   It's just a bunch of people getting together to hang out with their friends in the name
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.020]   of Jesus, right?
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:22.260]   But if we want the Lord's blessing, we have to welcome the Lord the way he wants to be.
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:28.220]   If he's going to be standing in the midst of us, we have to be gracious and holy at
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.260]   the same time, right?
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.820]   All right, so let me release you guys to your discussion.
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:35.940]   Take a picture of this.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:40.900]   Do me a favor next week, if possible, when you come into the room, can you sit with your
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.860]   small group?
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:48.460]   Sit with your small group so that you guys can take the first 10 minutes that you're
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:52.440]   here before we start worship, checking on your memory verses, okay?
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.580]   So that you don't have to do that when you go into your small group.
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:58.460]   So starting from next week when you come, try to sit with your small groups, okay?
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:05.860]   Let me pray for us and then I'll release you to your group.
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.860]   Gracious Father, we thank you for this evening.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.780]   We thank you for your living word.
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:13.980]   I pray that your Holy Spirit would guide the small group discussions, that there would
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:18.660]   be an honest and open discussion, that we may be able to share our weaknesses and our
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:24.120]   struggle, but at the same time, Lord God, that we do not create an environment where
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:27.220]   pursuing holiness is odd.
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:33.380]   Help us, Lord God, to reflect who you are in all that we are, knowing that this is your
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:36.820]   temple and that you are the head of the church.
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:41.700]   So we ask, Lord, that you would help us to take to heart all the warnings and the encouragements
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:47.580]   of these letters and that things that we need to glean personally and as a church, that
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.580]   we would apply it according to your purpose.
[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:51.340]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:54.500]   (audience applauding)
