[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.040]   Okay, start recording? Okay. All right, we're looking at Isaiah chapter 32 and 33. Isaiah
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.680]   chapter 32 is prophecy of the coming of the second coming of Jesus Christ and the first
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.040]   section of it is in reference to his nature and the kind of king he would be. Not only
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.240]   will he be a king that he rules, but it says that when he comes that he would be our hiding
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.060]   place and our refuge. So he, again, is presented to us as a savior. Chapter 33 mainly is about
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.600]   Assyria. And again, it's not 100%, but most people believe that the historical context
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.560]   behind chapter 33 is in reference to Assyria's domination over that area. And again, if that's
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.040]   the case, King Hezekiah is the king behind it. And it gives a description about his wrath
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:08.240]   against Assyria once the judgment is finished. So let's go into the text. Okay. So Thursday's
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.760]   first question is in verse 3, write it in your own words. In verse 3 it says, "Then
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.160]   the eyes of those who see will not be closed and the ears of those who hear will give attention."
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.160]   So the first thing, again, it says, "Once our eyes have been enlightened, we can never
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.840]   go back." Meaning, closely related to the second doctrine, the perseverance of the saints.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.080]   And to clarify, the perseverance of the saints is not in reference to that if you work hard
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.300]   and if you persevere, then you're going to somehow earn your salvation. The doctrine
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.040]   of perseverance of saints means that once your eyes have been opened, you can't choose
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.480]   to close your eyes. Kind of like a child, when he grows up and he recognizes that he's
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.160]   naked, you can never go back once those eyes are open. So in the same way, those people
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.560]   who have seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, if they genuinely have seen it, they
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.920]   won't go back. And that's basically what that means. And in 1 John it also says that those
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.100]   people who backslide left because they were never really of us. And if they were really
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.480]   of us, they would have never left. So leaving proved that their eyes were never truly open.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.920]   So that's what he's saying in verse 3. And then along with that, the third part of it
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.200]   says, "Truth will clearly be understood and be clearly spoken." So again, everything that
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.240]   we know about God was from a distance according to Corinthians. But when the true King comes,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.760]   that His truth is going to be clearly understood. And because we clearly understand it, we're
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.600]   able to clearly communicate it. The second section, all of it, we'll just put it up all
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:56.160]   at once. "Who are the fools and scoundrels?" referring to in verse 5 through 8. "A, the
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.720]   fool is a nation of the false leaders that people ran to in times of trouble." So during
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.800]   this period where there was a lot of foolish counsel toward Hezekiah and to the nation
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.880]   of Israel, saying that just give in to Assyria or make amends with other nations. And so
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.120]   basically what it's saying is God's going to prove them all wrong. "B, they will no
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.360]   longer be honored when the true King is revealed and His princes rule." So when Jesus finally
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.760]   shows up, they're going to be able to distinguish between who is right and who is wrong. So
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.240]   those people who are honored, the false prophets, the false leaders, they're going to be proven
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.320]   to be wrong and they will no longer be honored. "C, the fool only speaks folly because his
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.840]   heart is filled with folly." And okay, so how do we get here? "And his foolishness is
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.200]   not by chance but by plan." See in verse 6 it says, "For the fool speaks folly and his
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.000]   heart is busy with iniquity to practice ungodliness." So it's not something that he just kind of
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.160]   does instinctively, it just, it says that he's actually planning, he devises it in his
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.160]   heart. "They practice ungodliness." "D, E, they utter error concerning the Lord." In
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.000]   other words, they are false teachers. "F, because they're false teachers, the truth
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.920]   that they're disseminating does not feed the people. And they do not provide drink for
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.520]   the thirsty." And the ultimate reason why is because their motive is false. They're
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.400]   not leading because they're trying to shepherd the people and really care for the people.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.720]   Ultimately, their motive is selfishly motivated. And that's exactly what Paul says in the New
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.880]   Testament. He says, "When they come, they will devour you." Because their goal is ultimately
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.000]   for their own benefit. And so that's how Isaiah describes these false leaders as people who
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.480]   are being honored because the true king has not come. But when the true king comes, he
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:57.040]   said, "The truth is going to be revealed who is and who is not." What is the spiritual
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:05.080]   condition of the woman judged in verse 9? He said, "They are at ease and are complacent."
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.020]   And this is a description of the condition of the nation of Israel. Again, we mentioned
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.920]   this before, that the judgment of Israel is coming in a period of time when there was
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.940]   a lot of temple worship. For the most part, they were enjoying peace. They had money.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.920]   So it's not that everything was perfect, but they had freedom to worship. But they became
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:36.040]   complacent over and over again. God wars the nation of Israel. That period of danger in
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.600]   the nation of Israel is not when they're being attacked, is not when they're being judged.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.220]   It's when things seem to be going okay. There's no sense of urgency. There's no persecution
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.420]   going on. That they become complacent and satisfied. And you'll notice that their complacency
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.580]   is the beginning of all this folly. So the scripture says that once God fed them, they
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.400]   became proud. And once they became proud, they forgot God. And once they forget God
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.940]   and become complacent, that's when all this other trouble comes into the nation of Israel.
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.820]   So the other stuff that we're going to be looking at is directly linked to the complacency
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:19.980]   of the nation of Israel. They're called in verse 11 to strip and to make themselves bare,
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.780]   meaning to put away the superficial adorning that they are proud of. And again, this is
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.860]   indicative of a period in Israel's history, and it's also relevant to any culture where
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.940]   they have excess money, they have excess time, excess freedom. And instead of using that
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.740]   to pursue God, they're spending a lot of time in frivolous stuff. So what God is calling
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:49.100]   the nation of Israel to do in their complacency is to strip away, to bear, to take all these
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:57.520]   things out so that they may put their priorities straight. So what resulted in the exultant
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:05.580]   city because of their complacency, and again, all related to a lukewarmness toward God.
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.620]   God calls them to beat your breasts for the pleasant fields. Now, on the surface, what
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.680]   does that mean? You may just read that and just kind of, you know, one of those things
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:21.780]   that we don't understand. But the meaning is to give attention to giving of life. It
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:27.100]   means to give attention to the giving of life. To give life to the people who are growing
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.540]   up in Thorn's empire. So in other words, the imagery is of a mother who is breastfeeding,
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:39.700]   and instead of using her breasts and the breast milk to feed the nation, she again, is not
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:45.340]   using it properly. So basically, this imagery is, again, it's not just a rebuke to women,
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.180]   even though it says to complacent women, it is to the whole nation of Israel. That the
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.940]   resources that God has given for the purpose of life is being squandered for other things.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:03.140]   And so, as a result of that, He says the city has been forsaken. So all of this happens
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:09.980]   simply because of complacency. And so, this is what's happening in the nation of Israel.
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:17.220]   Again, this is a warning to all generations that, you know, we may think in comparison
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.980]   to all the other vices and sins, that complacency just kind of seems like maybe even a part
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.420]   of what it means to be a Christian. You know, we all have a tendency to kind of not to be
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.580]   serious at certain points, but there's a reason why in the book of Revelation, the harshest
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:38.900]   criticism and judgment is to the church of Laodicea. Because complacency is the beginning
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:45.460]   of all other sins. Because once we become proud, and once we begin to think that we're
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.620]   not desperate for God, all the other sins begin to creep in. And that's basically what
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:57.100]   He's saying to the nation of Israel. And what would call the wilderness to become fruitful?
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:03.260]   Eventually, if this is going to be turned around, what has to happen? He says, when
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.900]   the Spirit comes, when the Spirit is poured out on high, He says the revival is going
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:12.100]   to come. And that's exactly what the Scripture says. In the end times, God's going to pour
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:20.340]   out His Spirit, the young men will see visions, and old men will prophesy. So in other words,
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:26.380]   revival is not simply an effort of man. Revival comes when God answers our prayers, and the
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:34.020]   Holy Spirit begins to work in the hearts of men and women. So when we sense complacency,
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:39.380]   when we sense that maybe we're going down the wrong path, first and foremost, God calls
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:45.060]   us to Himself. That we need to pray and to cry out, because only when the Holy Spirit
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:51.300]   is engaged is there true revival. So when the Holy Spirit comes and says the wilderness
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:56.900]   will become fruitful again, again when you think of wilderness, you think of barrenness
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.220]   or judgment, and you say, but God is going to turn that around, that there may be more
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:08.060]   fruit, and there may be peace, quietness, and righteousness. In other words, God's going
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:13.120]   to intervene, and all the judgment of God that was coming because of complacency is
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:23.300]   going to be returned. So chapter 33, who are the destroyers and what will happen to them?
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:29.380]   We could think of the different nations, whether it's Assyria or Syria or Egypt or Babylonians.
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:34.180]   This particular context, there's enough historical hints that it is most likely referring to
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:39.900]   Assyria, and especially as we get to the next chapters, chapter 34 through chapter 39, it's
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:47.580]   clear that he's referring to the period when Assyrians were trying to attack Hezekiah.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:52.900]   So again, but we have to remember whenever we study the book of Isaiah, that the primary
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:59.940]   application is not ultimately historically at that particular time. Isaiah's prophecy
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:07.020]   is, uses the particular historical event as a springboard to talk about and prophesy about
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.580]   the last days, about the coming of Christ. So even though there's enough evidence for
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:18.620]   us to say, "Hey, this is talking about Assyria," ultimately, it is talking about the end times.
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:25.060]   He says, "Those who destroy will be destroyed." And he says, "Those who betray will betray."
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:30.140]   In other words, God's going to turn the tables around. And over and over again, we see that
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:36.620]   in the New Testament, he says, "The rich should be ashamed," not to say that you can't have
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:43.780]   money, but he's talking about how in our cultural system, in the God of this age, has it so
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:48.080]   that the rich are honored and the poor are ashamed. But he said when Christ comes and
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.100]   He restores His kingdom, in His kingdom, he says that the poor actually are the ones who
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:59.980]   are blessed. He says, "God is going to dumbfound the wise, and He's going to make the foolish
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:06.460]   seem wise in the Gospel." And that's exactly what He does. He deliberately chose Paul because
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.180]   he was the worst of sinners. Not because he was the smartest, not because he was the most
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:16.780]   righteous. So when God's judgment comes, He says He's going to reverse everything that
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:21.900]   this world has valued and honored and pursued, that He's going to turn it upside down, and
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:29.900]   realizing not only did they get it wrong, they got it absolutely wrong.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:40.620]   What will Zion be filled with? The primary characteristics of Zion is that the Lord will
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:46.220]   be exalted. So if we think about heaven, we think about the last times, like what is the
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:51.540]   main characteristic about that time? We could think about how all this other stuff that
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.140]   we'll be talking about, no disease, no crying, there's going to be better communication,
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:01.580]   we're going to have better physical bodies. But the primary characteristics of Zion is
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:07.420]   a place where God is exalted. So all the blessings that we think about, all the great things
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.940]   that we think heaven is going to be like, He says the primary, at the center of that,
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:19.340]   is because God is exalted. It's when He is exalted, all this other stuff happens. And
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:24.620]   He says, "The fear of the Lord will be their treasure." When was the last time you thought
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:30.140]   of fearing something as a treasure? And yet the scripture over and over again tells us
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:35.580]   the chief end of man is to fear God, and here, He actually says it's actually a treasure
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:43.740]   from God, it's a gift. Fear of the Lord is not only a command, but a gift. Recognizing
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.740]   the gift of righteousness and obedience is like falling in love with what is good for
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:54.300]   us. People who love to run can reap the benefits of running while enjoying the process as well.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:59.260]   It is only when we do not see the gift of fearing God that fear becomes a dread rather
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:04.780]   than our treasure. So, you know, oftentimes we think about God's commandments, maybe even
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:10.180]   His warnings, that we become burdened by it because we think that that's somehow a way
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:17.140]   to appease God. Not realizing that the very commandments of God is a source of joy. That's
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.860]   a source of our treasure. Just like when we're raising our kids and we tell our children,
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.220]   if you want to have, you know, we're going to go to Disneyland tomorrow or whatever,
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.820]   that you need to have a good night's sleep. And He may be kicking and fighting and resisting,
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.780]   but in the end, we're telling them so that they can have enough energy to enjoy what's
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:40.460]   coming the next day. But if He kicks and screams, "You know what, I'm going to do whatever
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.180]   I want," and He doesn't go to sleep until 5 in the morning, and then they wake up at
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.700]   7 in the morning, they're going to be miserable the whole time. So the command of God, the
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:53.900]   fear of God, is not simply to measure us and to see who's going to be righteous and
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.740]   who's not going to be righteous. In the end, it is a gift. That's why the scripture says,
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:05.740]   "Righteousness with contentment is great gain." When we realize that fearing God is the beginning
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:17.140]   of wisdom. See, obedience is not a burden. Obedience actually is a source of joy. So
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:22.660]   what does it mean to conceive chaff and give birth to stubble? Again, in God's judgment,
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:27.780]   the chaff and stubble are worthless things. Again, so we don't live in an agricultural
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:34.420]   context, so this needs a little bit of explaining. So the Bible talks about separating the wheat
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:40.620]   and the chaff. During that time, the chaff basically were the coverings of the wheat,
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.260]   and they need to separate that so that they can get to the wheat, and they would throw
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:49.060]   away the chaff. The stubble was basically what the stem that the chaff and the wheat
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:54.400]   was on. So once you remove the wheat, the chaff and the stubble basically is trash.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:59.260]   So what it's saying is, these Assyrians or these conquerors who were coming in and they
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:05.580]   were suppressing God's people, once their work is done, once God's period of allowing
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:11.500]   judgment to come to Israel, whether it's Assyria, whether it is Egypt or the Babylonians, they
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:18.100]   will become worthless and be thrown out. So as the nations are judged and brought low,
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:23.500]   the Lord will be exalted at the same time. So even in His judgment, ultimate end result
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:32.500]   is that God is going to be glorified. So to describe the characteristics of those who
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:39.140]   are able to dwell in Zion, so in contrast to those who are being judged, those remnants
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:45.620]   that God will restore, He said, one, they will walk righteously and speak uprightly.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:51.180]   You notice that whenever we talk about righteousness, that speech always comes along with it, and
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:56.540]   as we mentioned before, it's because Jesus said it's what comes out of a man. So when
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.700]   we talk about righteous walk and upright speech, He's talking about a man who's not only righteous
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:07.600]   externally, but someone who's righteous internally, that the Holy Spirit has genuinely regenerated
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:16.220]   that person. He despises the gain of oppression. In other words, His selfish desire to advance
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:24.500]   Himself and to use any means, He said He despises that. To shake His hand lest they hold a bribe.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:30.700]   In other words, what He holds, He holds loosely. A bribe is something that you are willing
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.580]   to have and cut corners and cheat because you want something so desperately that you're
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:41.700]   willing to cheat, lie, and do whatever you need to do. So to say that He shakes His hand
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:46.000]   lest they hold a bribe, in other words, He's always shaking it. He's not holding onto anything
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.140]   too tightly. He stops His ear from hearing bloodshed, that He refuses to engage even
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:18:00.180]   the planning and talk of evil, and then He shuts His eyes from looking on evil. He actively
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:06.220]   avoids what is wrong. So He said, these are the characteristics of an individual, not
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:11.300]   simply somebody who's achieved righteousness, but somebody who's been regenerated. There's
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:17.380]   not a description of an A student in the church. This is a description of somebody who's been
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:24.860]   deeply affected by the cross. And so His righteousness is not simply externally, it is internally.
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:32.660]   That His glory and His self-gain is not something that He seeks. He doesn't want bribes. He
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:42.300]   avoids evil. He actively pursues righteousness. What will the righteous see? Again, that term
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:49.300]   see is repeated over and over again when restoration happens, when salvation happens, as we see
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:54.580]   the glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. When Christ comes and all that God intended is
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.980]   restored, we see, just like we were talking about on Sunday, that our life comes when
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:05.140]   we see Zoe in Christ, and that we want that and we follow Him. And so we trade our life
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:10.860]   for His life, right? And so, first thing they see is that we will be whole. We will see
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:18.180]   the King in His full beauty. And that's what's going to change us in the end. That we're
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.340]   not going to be in heaven thinking like, "Ah, I don't want this, the worship is boring."
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:30.220]   So once we see His true beauty, we will be changed. They will see a land that stretches
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.980]   afar. In other words, he's talking about peace, right? When you see a land just kind of going
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.620]   on and on and on, there's no turmoil there. They will not see the insolent people and
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:46.100]   strange speech. In other words, these enemies will not be in their land and there will not
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:20:02.860]   be war. There will be peace in the land. How is Zion described in verses 20-24? It is an
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:09.020]   untroubled habitation, an immovable tent. In other words, it is permanent. But this
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:13.460]   is not just a temporary period. When Christ comes and He establishes His Kingdom, that
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:19.580]   there is nothing beyond that. That once He comes, that habitation is going to be permanent.
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:24.100]   That when the Lord comes, it will be like a broad river for us by His presence. So,
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:30.460]   Scripture describes river as a place of life, right? A blessed man is like a tree planted
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:35.820]   by the rivers of waters because there is resource of life constantly sustaining and causing
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:41.620]   this tree to bear fruit. And so the description of the end times when Christ comes and establishes
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:46.660]   His Kingdom is like He Himself is going to be like a broad river that we're all going
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:52.820]   to feed off of. And so just like He said to the Samaritan woman that He is the river,
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.620]   He is the living water that whoever drinks of Him will never go thirst again and again.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:04.060]   So it's related to how this describes when He comes. That He will be the ultimate…
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:20.220]   It's not working. Can you just press the button? Okay. He will be the ultimate judge
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:27.160]   and the lawgiver. There will be no injustice in the land. Next D, no one will be sick.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:33.720]   And then E, the people will be forgiven of their sins. Now if you notice that all the
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:39.560]   promises that are made about the restoration of Zion, that there's going to be peace,
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.800]   that we're going to have life, that there's not going to be any sickness, we're going
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:49.080]   to be forgiven of sins. All of this because God is exalted. That we're going to see
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:57.140]   His beauty, right? So again, as we wrap up at least this section of it, the focal point
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:04.400]   of salvation is God, is Jesus, is the Holy Spirit. John Piper wrote a book saying God
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:10.200]   is the gospel. He is the gospel. The gift of salvation isn't that through Him that
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.800]   He answers our prayers, that through Him we're going to have health, that through Him we're
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:19.840]   going to have eternity and peace and safety. He said the ultimate gift is when we recognize
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:28.500]   that true beauty, true life is Christ Himself. And so we'll see again all these descriptions.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:34.840]   And that's why complacency is so dangerous. Complacency basically means that we don't
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.120]   necessarily need Him. There's no sense of urgency to be with Him, to have intimacy with
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:47.540]   Him. So if everything that we desire is centered upon knowing Christ, seeing Christ, beholding
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:54.980]   His beauty, beholding His glory, complacency basically is to hear that and say, "Eh, I
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.940]   don't know if that's that important to you. Maybe for you, not for me." So again, we may
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:05.060]   not think of complacency as such a dangerous sin, but it is the beginning of the slippage
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:10.980]   where we're no longer beholding the things of God. Complacency basically is not seeing
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:17.140]   God, not being near God. And everything else that the scripture says happens as a result
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:23.460]   of a proud heart that has become complacent. Okay. All right. So that's it for the study.
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:28.260]   You can take the rest of the time to discuss with your group. And there are instructions
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.940]   about what to do for the next couple of weeks. Next week, we don't have Bible study. And
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:37.620]   then the week after that, I will come back. And you're actually going to be studying or
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:42.500]   reading all the way through chapter 39. So we're going to be covering all of that, at
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:49.540]   least bits and pieces of it. You'll notice that the last four chapters, 39, 38, 37, 36,
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:55.620]   they're all very historical. So I'm having you guys read each chapter for each day. But
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:00.580]   then there's instructions there. There's only memory verses for one week. And then for the
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:06.420]   second week, I'm asking you to review all the other verses. Okay. So I've given some
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:14.020]   instructions to Brian about that. And then I've asked James Hong to kind of just oversee
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:19.060]   the locking up and all this stuff. So again, we'll see you guys in a few weeks. Okay. Bye.
