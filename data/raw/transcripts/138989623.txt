[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   Why don't we turn our Bibles to Romans chapter 1, where our main focus today is going to
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.240]   be on verse 16 and 17, but I want to read from verse 8 all the way down to verse 17.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:23.480]   So Romans chapter 1, verse 8 through 17. Reading out of the ESV. "First I thank my God through
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.520]   Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world. For
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.920]   God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.560]   I mention you, always in my prayers asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.760]   succeed in coming to you. For I long to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.160]   gift to strengthen you, that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith,
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.640]   both yours and mine. I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.120]   but thus far have been prevented, in order that I may reap some harvest among you as
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.320]   well as among the rest of the Gentiles. I am under obligation both to the Greeks and
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.680]   to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. So I am eager to preach the gospel
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.680]   to you also who are in Rome. For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is a power of
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.560]   God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.240]   in it the righteousness of God is revealed for faith, as it is written, 'The righteous
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.880]   shall live by faith.' Let's pray. You are a gracious and loving God, and we've come
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.300]   this morning to worship you, to honor and glorify you. We desire, Lord God, to be faithful
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.880]   to your word, not only in preaching, but to listen and to obey. We pray, Father God, that
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.200]   the power of the cross would convict and strengthen us this morning. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.840]   Alright so our main focus is going to be in verses 16 and 17 and really at the heart of
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.880]   the book of Romans is verse 16 and 17. And I know that you guys, some of you guys have
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.720]   memorized it. You've heard probably sermons on it, Bible studies. And it is really at
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.920]   the core of what Paul is trying to say through this whole book. So his conclusion or his
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.360]   thesis is summed up in these two verses. So we talked about how Paul is about to jump
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.280]   in to the heart of the message of the gospel starting from verse 18. But before doing that
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.800]   from verses 1 through 17, he's laying out his ministry. He introduces himself as a servant
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.760]   who has been appointed as an apostle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. And then he talks
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.360]   about this gospel of his son Jesus Christ that was proclaimed and given to the Jews
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.400]   beginning in the Old Testament. And then we talked about his ministry, his attitude, and
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.760]   how personal it was and how he was constantly in prayer wanting to strengthen the church.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.880]   And then we looked at it a couple weeks ago how Paul says he was obligated both to the
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.240]   Greeks and to the barbarians. And then we talked about that how sometimes when we think
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.840]   of obligation we think of burden, but instead Paul ends that section by saying, "I am eager."
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.820]   Because of this obligation of the gospel, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.680]   who are in Rome. And he continues this thought of him being eager to preach the gospel in
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.320]   verse 16 where he says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel." So in essence he's saying
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.800]   the same thing. Whether you say it by saying, "I am bold. I am eager to preach." Or saying
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.040]   that, "I am not ashamed to preach." In the end what he's saying is, "I am compelled to
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.040]   do this. That this ministry that I am a part of to spread the gospel is something that
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.240]   is compelling inside of me no matter what. And I am not ashamed." Paul says, "I am not
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.240]   ashamed of the gospel," because that was not the norm. You know typically we think of the
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.440]   early church and we think of thousands of Apostle Pauls running around planting churches
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.480]   everywhere he goes. But the reason why he says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel," is
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.320]   because there are many people who were ashamed. The typical thing that we see in the church,
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.800]   we often times think that revival breaks out and all these people going out and bearing
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.880]   a lot of fruit. But if you look at church history from the very beginning of the preaching
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.480]   of the gospel with the Apostles it was typically a few men bearing a lot of fruit instead of
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.720]   a lot of people bearing a few fruit. And so we see Paul encouraging the church to not
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.400]   to be ashamed, to be bold in preaching the gospel because many of them were not. They
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.560]   claimed the faith in Jesus Christ but they kept it to themselves. They kind of kept it
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.600]   in their little things and they went to church but they weren't bearing fruit. They weren't
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.800]   bold for Christ. In fact at the end of Paul's life, remember when we were studying through
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   2 Timothy, Paul's primary message to his protege that as he is departing is to plead with his
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.200]   disciple that you would not turn from your faith like all these other men that have gone
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   before you. That all these people that have traveled with me and preached in the gospel
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.520]   and now that I'm headed to prison and possibly be executed that some of them were ashamed
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.160]   and some of them saw the consequences of what they were doing. They were beginning to fall
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:18.120]   out. In our generation we have the same issue. You know exactly what percentage of people
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.920]   who claim to be Christians are actively involved in sharing their faith. Now we can make the
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.320]   mistake in thinking that if you're part of a church that does missions that somehow you
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.280]   are doing missions. That if you're friends or if you're part of a group that we're part
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.960]   of that. I don't want to get to the exact numbers but we know that it's very small.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.640]   That very few people even in our generation is actively involved in sharing this message.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.440]   So what Paul has to say to the Romans, what Paul had to say to the early church and to
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.840]   Timothy is very relevant today. That we ought not to be ashamed of the gospel. We ought
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.600]   to be eager to preach the gospel. Now why were they ashamed? What are some of the things
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.920]   that caused them to be timid in sharing the gospel? Well let me say right off the bat.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.960]   They weren't persecuted because they were good people. Again we have a lot of stirring
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:18.560]   up in our generation where it's almost a thing to do and thing to say. That social justice
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.120]   is what we ought to be. And so there's been a lot of stirring up in the last 10 to 15
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.360]   years. This conversation of wanting to help the poor and you know doing building bridges
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.880]   or water pumps and all this stuff. And all of those things are fantastic. I think it's
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.320]   absolutely necessary because that ought to be the character of a Christian. That we ought
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.440]   to be concerned for people who are suffering. But that was not the reason why the early
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.320]   church was persecuted. When was the last time somebody got persecuted for helping the poor?
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.920]   You know you'll be commended. Christians and non-Christians alike. Not just in the United
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.720]   States, all over the world. If you go there to give them physical help, you'll be praised.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:10.120]   In fact, even during the time of Jesus, they didn't hate Jesus because of his works. You
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:16.760]   know, he fed the poor. He had people who were sick and he would raise them. I mean they
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:23.680]   didn't hate Jesus for that. In John 10.33, the Jews talking to Jesus says, "It is not
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.160]   for a good work that we are going to stone you, but for blasphemy. Because you being
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:35.640]   a man, make yourself God." He says, "It's not for anything that you've done. It's what
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.920]   you're saying that's offending us. And it was so offensive to us that we're willing
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.920]   to stone you and kill you." What is so offensive about what he said? What is so offensive of
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:54.720]   the gospel that it's offensive? Not just today, it's always been offensive. Jesus didn't tell
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.120]   his disciples that, you know, "I'm going to leave and they're going to thank you for bringing
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.160]   the truth." He said, "No, they didn't know me, so they're not going to know you either.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.120]   So don't be surprised that as I send you out to preach the gospel, that they reject you.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.520]   They hate you. They persecute you. Drag you into prison because they did this to me and
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:20.880]   they will do this to you." What is the offense of the gospel? That so many people who claim
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:29.400]   to know Jesus and to claim to believe in this truth are unwilling to share this. Well, the
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.920]   gospel itself, right off the bat, is offensive. Very first thing about the gospel is very
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.760]   offensive. Today, you know, we have this movement of being gospel-centered, but oftentimes when
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.480]   somebody says gospel-centered, they're talking about the very end part of the gospel. You
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.360]   know, they're talking about how we've sinned and no matter what you do, Jesus loves you
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.120]   and He died for you. It doesn't matter what you do because it's only what He did. And
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.360]   so we're talking about the very end part where He forgives your sin. And so you can do whatever
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.440]   you want. Maybe you shouldn't, but it doesn't matter because God loves you no matter what.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.880]   Now why would that message be offensive? Why would the message of universal love, unconditional,
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.240]   no matter what you do, you have a free ticket to Heaven if you say you believe in Jesus?
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.800]   Why would that be so offensive? But when you take a careful look at the gospel, Paul's
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.640]   about to jump in to the depth of the gospel starting from verse 18. And we're going to
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:27.520]   get into that next week. But verse 18, he begins a clear and thorough presentation of
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:33.040]   the gospel by saying, "For the wrath of God is being revealed in Heaven against all ungodliness,
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:39.080]   unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth." The beginning of the
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:46.680]   gospel presents and clarifies where we stand before Him. We are not neutral, the scripture
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:52.520]   says. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. So the first three chapters,
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.760]   Paul digs in to the depth of depravity of mankind. So by the time you get to chapter
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.280]   3, verse 10, I mean if you haven't been offended by then, you will definitely be offended.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.200]   I'm not going to go there now. You may want to look at it later, right? But if you haven't
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.040]   read it, brace yourself because you don't come out good, right? He starts right off
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:17.720]   the bat. All have sinned. God is not happy with you. God is angry. The wrath of God is
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.680]   being revealed. Those of you who have the law, you're guilty with the law. Those of
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.200]   you who don't have the law, you're guilty without the law. We're all guilty under God.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:36.200]   We're all guilty of judgment. So to a humanist, it is extremely offensive to sit down with
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.160]   somebody and to tell them that God is not happy with you. When all the message that
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:48.360]   we are receiving in our generation is just self-esteem, you know, you're good. You know,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.160]   at the core of who you are, you're good. And that's why God saw something precious in you.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.000]   And that's why he loved you. That's why he pursued you. But that's not what the Bible
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.400]   says. The Bible said his pursuit was despite our ugliness, despite our rejection, despite
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:11.480]   where we stood before God, he came after us. So the very beginning of the message is offensive.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.800]   At the heart of the gospel message is the identity of Jesus Christ. That Jesus Christ
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:22.040]   is the Son of God and he is God himself. He made that very clear. He said, "Before Abraham
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.800]   was I am." He was saying that the God of the Old Testament that these Jews bowed down and
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:37.840]   worshipped was him. And later on Paul clarifies that everything was made by him and for him.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:43.640]   So at the heart of the gospel message is that Jesus Christ is God. Now that is offensive
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:50.560]   to all kinds of people. It's offensive to Muslims. It offends Jehovah's Witnesses. If
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.920]   you sit down and talk with them and detail what they mean by that, they're offended by
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.760]   that. In fact a while back I was trying to share the gospel with this Jewish lady and
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.400]   as I was talking I quoted the New Testament. I said, "The New Testament." And then she
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.600]   just stopped. She said, "Peter, what you said to me was very offensive." And I said, "What
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.400]   do you mean?" She said, "We don't believe in the New Testament. We only read the Old
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.560]   Testament." Obviously she doesn't call it Old Testament. She calls it the Torah. "We
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.840]   only believe in the Torah. And it's offensive to me when you call it the New Testament."
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.320]   And in the back of my mind I was thinking I'm very offended by what you just said. You
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:34.400]   know what I mean? I'm offended that you're offended. But just to mention that there's
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.760]   a New Testament, obviously that Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of all these prophecies
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:44.520]   was offensive to her. In fact, again at the heart of the gospel message and why these
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:51.120]   things are necessary that all have sin and that Jesus Christ the Son of God and the crux
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:58.440]   of this gospel message is that Jesus Christ crucified is the only salvation for mankind.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.840]   Only salvation. If you say that Jesus Christ is a Savior that doesn't offend a lot of people.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:09.120]   It's like, "Oh, that works for you." Right? And I'm glad that you believe that. But once
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.960]   you begin to proclaim what Jesus meant by it when He said, "I am the way and the truth
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:20.000]   and life. Nobody comes to the Father but through me." In Acts chapter 4, 12, "And there is
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.240]   salvation in no one else. For there is no other name under heaven given among men by
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:35.360]   which we must be saved." In our pluralistic, relativistic society to make an absolute claim
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.840]   of Jesus being the only way. Maybe there's some of you sitting here thinking, "You know
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.320]   what? You can preach Jesus. You can preach about what He did. You can preach about His
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:49.440]   love and even His holiness. But once you begin to say that He's the exclusive only way of
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.960]   salvation, that's arrogant. Maybe you can say, you know, that, "Maybe the Bible says
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.280]   this but I'm not really that convinced." Or maybe, you know, who knows God's going to
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.360]   be the judge and that seems to be the popular way that a lot of these televangelists seems
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:09.080]   to answer questions. You know, "Do you really believe that a Muslim can't be saved or a
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:15.000]   Jehovah Witness or a Buddhist can't be saved?" And a lot of the way that these people answer
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.320]   these questions because they know the kind of response they're going to get from the
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:24.040]   world. "Oh, you know, we preach the love of Christ but I don't want to be the judge. I'm
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.000]   going to leave the judgment to God." Well, God did make a judgment and that's why we
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.880]   have the Word of God. And Scripture made that absolutely crystal clear. So at the core of
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:40.840]   the Gospel, when you are preaching and teaching what it says, it is very offensive. And the
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:46.720]   moment you try to make the Gospel less offensive by tweaking the Gospel in such a way that
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:54.400]   it doesn't sound as offensive is no longer the Gospel. And so I have to say in many circles,
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.560]   even under the term evangelical Christians, that this has happened because we're trying
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:05.920]   very hard not to make the offense. We can talk about Jesus without offending people.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.560]   We can talk about salvation of sin without offending people. We can talk about the exclusivicity
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:17.960]   of Christ without offending people, if that was even possible. See, this preaching of
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:25.520]   the Gospel has never been accepted by the majority. It's never been a situation where
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.120]   all people who are claiming to be Christians were out there proclaiming the Gospel and
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.120]   a lot of fruit came from a lot of people. If you look at church history, you'll always
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:41.880]   find a few people who are not ashamed of the Gospel bearing a lot of fruit. And that's
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.000]   what's happening here with Paul. Paul's trying to encourage this church and the early
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:54.440]   church to gear up for this struggle. And so Paul says, again at the end of verse 13, he
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.040]   says, "I'm eager to preach the Gospel." And then he, verse 16, he says the same thing
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:03.960]   the opposite way, "I am not ashamed of preaching the Gospel." In other words, he's declaring
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:10.960]   that this is why I'm so bold. This is why I'm willing to go to prison and even die in
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:16.560]   preaching this Gospel. So what I want to look at this morning, and I'm going to spend bulk
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:22.840]   of the time in the first point and then sometime at the latter point, why was Paul able to
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.840]   be so bold? What gave him this boldness? And what gives us this boldness to preach the
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:36.480]   Gospel? First thing, boldness comes from knowing the truth and being convicted of it. Let me
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:44.640]   say it again. Boldness comes from knowing the truth and being convicted of it. As an
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:50.560]   example, if you go into a doctor's office, the information they give you typically is
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:56.720]   not wishy-washy, because it doesn't help. If somebody says, "I think you're sick. I
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.240]   think your leg is broken." No, they got to give you a definitive answer. You go and get
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.960]   an x-ray and they look at it and say, "It's broken." And they'll show you why it's broken.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.560]   Here's the symptoms of broken. And then they'll tell you how to fix it. You go to a doctor's
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.960]   office, "It could be broken." "What do I do about it?" "You could do this, you could
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:20.760]   do that." Right? And if you're not clear, the reason why they're able to be bold is
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:26.520]   because they look at it and from their experience, from their education, they look at it and
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.320]   say, "Well, this is the truth. This is what's going on." "Oh, it's so inconvenient. If my
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.120]   leg is broken, it'd be so inconvenient. I can't go to work and I got to put this cast
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:39.200]   on and I got a basketball game coming up." And it's like, "Okay, okay. You know, I don't
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.400]   want to offend you. I don't want to make your life uncomfortable." It's like, "No, the doctor's
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.040]   going to tell you. You're going to have to quit work, even if you can't go in and make
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.880]   a living. They have to tell you because they know that this is true. And this is true of
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:56.280]   you." Engineer walks in, looks at the building and says, "You know what, engineer, the structure
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.120]   is not safe and everybody needs to move out." And say, "Wait a second. If this happens,
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.000]   we can't meet. We have over 400 people at the church and where are we going to move
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.480]   them?" It's like, "I don't know where you're going to move them. I'm just telling you that
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.200]   this is what I know, you know. And we'll deal with the consequences, but I'm telling you
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:19.320]   what I know is that this building is unsafe." He has to speak with conviction. You might
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.640]   be a lawyer, right? And somebody comes in and asks about this contract and you're reading
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.840]   it and they say, you know, and say, "Well, is it safe? Is this okay for us to enter this
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:33.040]   contract?" "Yeah." You know. "You might get sued. You might lose your house." "Yeah, I
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:39.120]   don't know." You know. No, they speak with clarity because that's what they know. Paul
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:45.000]   speaks with clarity and with conviction and boldness because he's absolutely convinced
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:52.120]   that this is true. And he understands the consequences. So Paul says 2 Corinthians 2,
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:57.480]   17, "For we are not like so many peddlers of the Word of God. But as men of sincerity,
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:03.720]   as commissioned by God, the side of God, we speak in Christ." So think about that. Even
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:08.040]   in the early church, there were people who were peddling the Word of God. Some of them
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:15.760]   were preaching the gospel for their own personal gain. Does that happen today? I'm pretty sure
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:22.840]   it does happen. But people who peddle the Word of God as soon as the benefit that comes
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:29.160]   from preaching the Word of God is no longer worthy of pursuit, they're gone. As soon as
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:34.640]   it's hard to take care of family or difficulties or whatever, they'll pack up and they'll leave.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:40.760]   And I think that's the first thing that disqualifies somebody from a gospel preacher. That if we
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:45.720]   are not convicted that this is the truth, and at all costs that this must go out where
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:51.560]   Paul says, "I'm compelled to do this." 2 Corinthians 3, 12, after Paul presents to the
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:57.520]   Corinthians that here's the truth of the gospel, how the glory of Christ, the revelation of
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:03.080]   this is causing this for people to grow and to come to him. After giving a thorough presentation
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:10.720]   of the gospel in 2 Corinthians 3, 12 it says, "Since we have such a hope, we are very bold."
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:17.120]   Paul says his boldness comes from knowing and being convicted of this truth. In fact,
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:23.680]   in the book of Acts chapter 4, 13, Peter preaches the first gospel. And in this first gospel,
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.840]   he remember he's preaching in front of the very same people who declared, "Crucify him,
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:34.880]   crucify him." The leaders who made the decision to get rid of Jesus that Peter was afraid
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.000]   of, that all the other disciples were afraid of it, and they were hiding before Jesus went
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.880]   to the cross. But after the cross, he's standing in front of the same people and he begins
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:51.240]   to preach the gospel, convicting them, "You crucified the author of life." And they were
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:57.680]   amazed. This is what they say, Acts 4, 13, "Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:04.840]   John and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished and they
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:11.440]   recognized that they had been with Jesus." They were so dumbfounded by their boldness.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:17.960]   Don't these guys know that just as if we were able to kill Jesus, I mean, killing them would
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:23.400]   be nothing. You know? If these guys were able to get rid of Jesus who was being followed
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:29.880]   around by thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of his disciples in that area, why would they
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:35.760]   think that this is not going to happen to them? Where did they get their boldness? It
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:40.120]   wasn't because all of a sudden Peter realized, "Ah, he can't touch me, I have the Holy Spirit."
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.480]   That's not where his boldness was coming from. He was confused. When Jesus was saying that
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:50.200]   he was going to go to the cross, all his disciples were hearing, "Okay, I don't get why you're
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.160]   going to the cross, but after the Kingdom comes, will you let me sit to the left or
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.720]   to the right? Who's going to be the greatest?" They were thinking about the benefit. But
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.640]   after the cross, everything, all the bits and pieces, the puzzles that they were hearing
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:10.440]   from Jesus came together and all of a sudden it became clear. Everything that Jesus said.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.360]   They were already convinced about Jesus, they just weren't convinced about what he was saying.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:21.320]   And all of a sudden, they became bold. They realized that even in death, that there's
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:31.880]   life. Boldness comes from knowing and being convicted of this truth. If we're not convinced
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:41.440]   that this is true, we will not be bold. How can you be bold about saying this to anybody?
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:47.160]   You can't casually preach the Gospel. No more than you can casually come into a room and
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:53.160]   say, "If you don't leave, this room is going to burn down." You can't casually tell somebody
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:59.040]   you have cancer. You can't casually tell somebody, "Pack up your bags and get out of this building
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:07.520]   because it's going to collapse." You can't casually say that unless it's true. You cannot
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:16.800]   casually commit to preaching the Gospel. What it claims is too serious and too intense.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.680]   And that's why Paul says, "I am not ashamed because I am convinced that it is the power
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:31.120]   of God for salvation." The Gospel is the power that saves. Think about all the advancements
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:38.040]   in the last hundred years. Every time I use my smartphone, I'm amazed. I know some of
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:43.640]   you guys are kind of amazed. It's just a phone. Right? And again, I didn't have a cell phone
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:50.560]   until I was 30 years old. Internet probably, what, about the same time. And my smartphone
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:54.680]   probably, what, I had what, the last two years now? And so now every once in a while, I use
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:24:00.200]   a smartphone and I'm talking to Pastor Alex in China and I'm texting him. It's like, "Oh
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.240]   my gosh, I'm talking to this guy. This guy's in China right now." I mean, not seem like
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.840]   a big deal, but the very first time I went out to China, I mean, to make one phone call
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.520]   was a big, big ordeal. Right? The fact that I can look up something, I can say, "Oh, I
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.520]   wonder if that's true." You know? Before, when I used to have that thought, I'd have
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:25.080]   to, "Okay, I think I'm available Tuesday morning. I'm going to clear my schedule, drive to Biola,
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.160]   look up these reference books." And I had to make about a four or five hour commitment
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:34.640]   next Tuesday to see if I can get an answer to this question. Today, like, "Oh, I wonder.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:45.220]   Is this true?" Boom. Right? With all the technological advancements that we have, right? Set somebody
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:52.960]   to the moon, creating the atomic bomb, atomic energy, airplanes, automobiles. You know,
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:58.920]   14 years ago, had the huge tin towers, the terrorist attack. And then now you go back
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   over there and they built this tower even more magnificent than before. Robotics and
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.760]   other talk about artificial intelligence. Why not? Considering everything that we were
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:17.760]   able to advance in. But one thing has always been true, will always remain true. That the
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:24.800]   core of who man is, you can advance yourself to make yourself more knowledgeable, more
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:31.600]   honored, more wealth, more comfortable, more influence. Whether you are the richest man
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:40.080]   on earth or the poorest man on earth, you cannot change the nature of your being. The
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.280]   scripture says, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." This corrupt nature
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:50.680]   that hangs with us, even in your wildest dreams coming true, at the core of the problem of
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:56.440]   who we are, there's nothing that you and I could do about it. No amount of human advancement
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:02.840]   can ever touch this. That's why in chapter 3, the paralytic come into Jesus and they
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.020]   wanted him to heal them. Jesus said, "Your sins are forgiven." And they were offended.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:13.920]   And they were right to be offended because they understood, "Who can dare say this? Only
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:20.520]   God could forgive sins. Even Moses can't say that. Elijah can't say that. David can't say
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:27.920]   that. How dare you say that?" Jesus turns to them and says, "Which is harder to do? To
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:34.000]   say your sins are forgiven or get up and walk?" You have to remember, Jesus is the Son of
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.080]   God. He declared to be God Himself. The scripture says that everything was made by Him and for
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:49.920]   Him. He made the whole universe by His words. So what is it to Him to tell Him, "Your sins
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.880]   are forgiven." I mean, to get up and walk. Nothing. He could create a whole new being
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:04.200]   from dust to just fix a crooked leg. A broken spine to Him is nothing. In other words, what
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:11.520]   was Jesus saying? His display of power was not in feeding of the 5,000. His display of
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:19.720]   power was not to get the lame to walk or walking on the shores in the storm. That was not the
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:30.160]   display of His power. His display of His power was to say, "Your sins are forgiven." That's
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.800]   the greatest display. That's why in Romans chapter 10, 17, "So faith comes from hearing
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:40.520]   and hearing through the Word of Christ." The only thing that can change an individual and
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:51.600]   transform his destiny for eternal, eternity, is Christ crucified. Preaching of Christ crucified.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.400]   And when somebody hears the Word of Christ and believes it, it has the power to save
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:03.680]   him, transform him inside and out. That's why 1 Corinthians 1, 18, Paul says again,
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.360]   "For the Word of the Cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:15.760]   saved it is the power of God." It is a mistake to think that in the church, that if we are
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.760]   organized enough, if we have a certain way of doing things, and if we have this help
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:26.360]   and that help, if we have some kind of accountability, people don't change because they meet the
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:34.840]   right people. If I'm surrounded by certain people, I change. Superficially, yes. Nothing
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:41.600]   has the power to transform and to save a soul. No amount of money, no amount of technology,
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:48.560]   no amount of influence is able to save souls. Scripture says, "My sheep hear My voice, and
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:57.120]   they follow Me." Christ crucified. And again, in 1 Corinthians 15, 1, it says, "Now I would
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:02.200]   remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preach to you, which you received and which you stand,
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:08.160]   and by which you are being saved." Not only were you saved, but a Christian who is genuinely
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:13.600]   saved is in the process of being saved. He's being transformed from one kingdom to another.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.600]   We talked about a couple weeks ago. And if you hold fast to the Word, I preach to you,
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:25.320]   unless you believed in vain. In other words, unless your faith was not real, right? You
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:33.920]   just professed because you wanted to belong. Only the clear preaching of the Word of God,
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:41.720]   clear preaching of Christ, can save people. Despite the organization, despite the lack
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:52.440]   of ability, despite the money, despite the training. Travel anywhere outside the United
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:57.480]   States who doesn't have even the tenth of the resources that you and I have. And the
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:07.360]   church is strong. Evangelists are powerful. The gospel is spreading in force. And yet,
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.920]   you come to the United States where we have all the resources that in the last 2,000 years
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:17.520]   put together could not match with the resources that you and I have. And yet, we don't have
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:25.120]   the same power. Because the power is not with the resources. The power is in the gospel.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:30.240]   That's why Paul says he is not ashamed. He is absolutely convinced of this truth. For
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.920]   the gospel, he says in verse 17, not only does it save, he says it reveals the righteousness
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:40.920]   of God from faith to faith. Typically, when we think about the gospel, we think it reveals
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:46.680]   His mercy, right? It's like, "Ah, you know, the gospel shows His mercy and His grace and
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:52.640]   His patience with sinners." But we don't typically think about righteousness being displayed
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:31:01.320]   by the gospel, right? We think of grace, mercy. So what does he mean when he says the gospel
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:06.640]   is the revelation of God's righteousness? What does that mean? God's righteousness is
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:16.680]   displayed in two ways. One, the gospel, the cross, reveals His nature of righteousness.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:22.680]   Let me explain what I mean by that. The scripture says very clearly that God's nature cannot
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.840]   be changed. In fact, Hebrews 6, 17-18, let me read that for you. "So when God desired
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.600]   to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   His purpose, He guaranteed it with an oath, so that by two unchangeable things in which
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.520]   it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.240]   to hold fast to the hope set before." So let me summarize what he says here. There's two
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:50.880]   things that he cannot do. One, he cannot change his nature and he cannot lie, which in essence
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:57.200]   is the same thing. God is immutable in what He says and God is immutable in who He is.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.840]   The reason why he says that is that the God of the Old Testament is the same God of the
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:07.320]   New Testament. He didn't all of a sudden decide, you know what, I'm just going to forget about
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:12.880]   it. All the warnings that he gave to the Old Testament believers and saying, you know what,
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.600]   if you obey my commands, here's some blessing that's going to come to you. And if you disobey
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.180]   my commands, here's some curses that's going to come to you. And all of a sudden Jesus
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:26.640]   shows up and He says, you know what, I know I said all of these things, just forget about
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.120]   it. Just forget. I'm just going to be gracious and I'm just going to forget about it. Which
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:36.040]   a lot of people think that that's what the gospel is, right? Just forget about it, right?
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.600]   And I'm just going to display my mercy. So we have a tendency to think that in the Old
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:45.480]   Testament God was very harsh and He was judgmental and He was righteous and He's angry. He comes
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:50.320]   to the New Testament, He's just like, He's almost like we have a sanctified God, right?
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:55.480]   He's sanctified. He grew. He matured. You know what I mean? So now He's not so angry.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:01.240]   He's just gracious. But that's not what Paul says. He says the gospel actually is a display
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:10.120]   of His righteousness, of His nature. You have to understand the primary understanding of
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:16.360]   the Jews after they receive all that. Remember Jonah? Remember why he didn't want to go to
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:22.880]   Nineveh? And he didn't want to go to Nineveh because he was afraid that if he warned them
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:29.000]   about the judgment coming and they repent that God would forgive them. And that's exactly
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.480]   what happens. He goes back and he reluctantly warns them and they all repent, even the king.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:41.320]   And then he gets angry. He said, I knew it. I knew it. I knew you were gracious and I
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:46.920]   knew you were merciful and I knew you would forgive their sins. See the Jews already knew
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:52.880]   that. Jews already knew how merciful and how patient God was with that nation. They should
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:58.560]   have been wiped out a long time ago. But how was God going to save and be merciful and
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:07.920]   yet not forfeit who He is? See that's the cross. He didn't just simply say, he snapped
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.600]   fingers and said, okay, okay, you know, I'm just going to forget about all your sins.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:19.080]   God cannot deny Himself. There's nothing that He does where His holiness and His love is
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:28.680]   in somehow contradiction. See at the cross is where His holiness and His love is displayed
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:37.480]   to the greatest. Let me explain. When Jesus was going to the cross, Jesus said, I'm going
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:43.920]   to glorify you. And Father, it's time for you to glorify the Son. So at the cross, God
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:51.880]   is glorified and the Son is glorified. And how was He being glorified? There's two natures,
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:57.040]   nature of God. And really it's the same nature, but it's a two nature displayed where His
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:02.680]   holiness and His love. It says God is holy. God is love. Now sometimes we think, well,
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:08.440]   either you're love or you're holy, you can't go hand in hand. But the cross was the perfect
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:15.760]   display of His holiness. So when we think about His holiness, where is His holiness
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:25.720]   in the greatest of display? It's at the cross. Because at the cross where all of His wrath,
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:33.320]   all of the judgment of mankind, past, present and future that He has elected was at display,
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:40.120]   putting it upon Jesus. You remember when Jesus, when God was angry with the nations and He
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.200]   was angry with them and He brought the flood? Yeah, I mean we would think, well, that's
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:49.480]   the greatest display of His righteous anger. But that was only anger for them. That was
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:57.000]   only justice for them. At the cross, Jesus took upon Himself the wrath of past, present
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.720]   and future of all generations. So it is at the cross where we see the greatest display
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:12.440]   of His righteousness. And as it's being displayed, on the flip side of that, that as He absorbs
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:18.600]   it, the greatest display of His love. You know, we often think about Jesus, how He humbled
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:23.400]   Himself and He washed the disciples' feet. And yes, I mean, yes, that was very humble
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:28.240]   and it was a very great display. But that was for the disciples. That was for them at
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:35.480]   that time. But the greatest display of His grace and mercy was at the cross, when it
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:43.440]   was the darkest. And so when we think about, well, who is God? What is the greatest thing
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:50.400]   that you and I ought to think of? It's the cross. Let me give you an example. You know,
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.680]   we talk about, you know, I don't remember the details, but there are some games that
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.160]   Michael Jordan played. And I know some of you guys say, "Oh, it's Kobe, Michael Jordan."
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:02.080]   All right, so let's end this debate now, okay? It's Michael Jordan. All right, so there's
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.000]   some games that Michael Jordan played that it was just ridiculous. And I don't remember
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.440]   the details, but when you think about and say, "Hey, what's the display?" When there's
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:14.960]   this argument between Kobe and Michael Jordan, like, okay, so you say he's the greatest.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:22.320]   Well, prove it, right? Well, how do you prove it? You look at the game that he played that
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:28.240]   magnifies his skills, right? And the greater the opposition, well, you know, Michael Jordan
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:33.120]   came into this game and this other team, they had the best record of that season. Everybody
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:37.880]   thought that they were going to win. Michael Jordan was actually sick that day. He had
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:43.400]   a 102 fever and he barely was walking that morning. And, you know, and he had tragic
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.120]   things happening in his life and everybody thought that there's no way that he had any
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.160]   chance. And then he comes in and he scores 60 points and then he wins the game winning
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:57.960]   shot with four guys defending him with his eyes closed. You know what I mean? So when
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:04.640]   we talk about the greatness of Michael Jordan and his basketball skills, we look at a particular
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:12.080]   game where this greatest access is displayed. And that's where we go when we say, "Here's
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:16.480]   Michael Jordan." And you look at that, that's why we think he's the greatest. So when we
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:22.800]   think about God, when we display God, when we present God, where do we go to present
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:32.040]   God? Where is his greatest attribute at greatest display? It's at the cross. And so that's
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:37.440]   what Paul is saying, that not only is it the power of God to save, but the righteousness
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:46.600]   of God, his nature is at the greatest display at the cross. Not only is his nature displayed,
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:51.680]   but because of his nature of righteousness being displayed, is that we've been affected.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:58.160]   2 Corinthians 5.21, "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:04.920]   him we might become the righteousness of God." That in his righteousness displayed. That's
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:12.480]   the difference between glorifying the world and glorifying Christ. We can glorify Michael
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:17.880]   Jordan, put him on a pedestal, and we may find some satisfaction in doing that because
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:26.280]   we're creatures of worship. But at the end of the day, there's emptiness. There's artificial
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:33.640]   joy. But the scripture says when we magnify Christ and his righteousness, we're affected.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:38.960]   His righteousness becomes imputed to us. Not only do we display his glory, that in displaying
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:46.080]   his glory, we are affected. And that's why Paul is saying, "I am not ashamed of this
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:53.480]   gospel. That's why I am bold to proclaim this gospel." So we're bold about Lakers,
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:40:01.440]   we're bold about Golden State Warriors, we're bold about some football teams, baseball teams,
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:11.560]   all artificial, all superficial. But how about Christ? How about the gospel of Jesus Christ?
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:18.960]   See, being convicted of this truth is what gives us boldness. Being affected by this
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:24.280]   truth is what gives us boldness. But let me, I told you that's my first point. The second
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:28.880]   point, and I'm going to spend a little bit of time on this, is the second reason why
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:35.640]   he was bold is because he genuinely loved them. You can have all the truth and be convicted
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.560]   of all of this and just not care. It's like, "Ah, okay, whatever." You know, you're saying,
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.840]   "Oh, you believe it. That's good for you." But maybe you're convicted about it, but you
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:52.400]   don't care if somebody is saved or not. Paul was bold because he genuinely desired them
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:56.940]   to be saved. He was convinced that the only salvation for mankind is the gospel of Jesus
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:05.040]   Christ, and he desired so much for people to be saved. Romans 9, 1-3, Paul says, "I
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.840]   am speaking the truth in Christ. I am not lying. My conscience bears me witness in the
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:15.920]   Holy Spirit that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart, for I could wish that
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:21.040]   I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen, according
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:27.280]   to the flesh. I desire so much that even if I was somehow able to trade spaces with the
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:37.320]   nation of Israel, I would." Love gives us boldness. Love gives us boldness. Let me give
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:44.200]   you an example. If you knew somebody in your life that was making poor choices. You know,
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:48.280]   they're spending money frivolously, and they're always, you know, falling short in paying
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:53.860]   bills, and their eating habits, and their just habits, period. They're just going down
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:59.520]   the wrong path, and you're very concerned for them. Now, if they happen to be an acquaintance,
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.720]   you might have a light conversation and say, "You know what? Oh, man, that guy is making
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:08.520]   poor choices. I hope somebody would say something to them." You know? And if you're bold enough,
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.680]   you'll bring them to me. You know, because that happens a lot. And I get an email, I
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:18.400]   say, "Hey, this is happening. Can you please do something?" You know? So, that may be.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:23.600]   If there's your acquaintance, you may, you may have some boldness to say something. If
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.680]   that's a friend of yours, depending on the quality of friendship you have, you may be
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.480]   a little bit more bold. "Hey, let's get together and have lunch. I want to talk to you about
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:35.040]   something." And you may, you may kind of say it in a way where it's like, "I don't want
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:39.360]   to offend you, but here's some things I'm concerned because I genuinely care about you,
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.080]   and I feel like I need to say this for your own good." And say, "Hey, hey, hey, don't
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:48.040]   judge me." You know? And that may be enough for you to kind of say, "Okay, okay. He didn't
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:52.760]   want to hear it. I've done my part." Right? If that's a family member, you'd be a little
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.920]   bit more bold. If it's a sister, brother, father, mother, and say, "Hey, you know what?
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.000]   These are consequences. Maybe you shouldn't be doing that." And they say, "Hey, hey, hey,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.120]   don't judge me." It's like, "What are you talking about? You know, I just want you to,
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.440]   I want to make sure that you're doing the right thing." And you would be a little bit
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:14.040]   more bold to speak the truth. But if that was your child, if that was your son or your
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:19.880]   daughter making that mistake and going down the wrong path, and it's absolutely unacceptable
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:26.400]   the consequences that's going to come their way, we will become emboldened to speak to
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:33.920]   them. Because it's not acceptable, the consequence. You over there, you say, "You know what? I
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.560]   don't want to be judgmental." And all of a sudden, you will be judgmental. "Oh, I don't
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.840]   want to rock the world. I don't want them to dislike me." It's like, no matter how you
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:48.080]   feel about me, you can't keep doing this. We become emboldened based upon the degree
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:55.760]   of love that we have for that individual. So when Paul says, "I am enduring all things
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:01.280]   for the sake of the elect," it's because he not only is convicted about these truths,
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:08.720]   he desired so much for them to come to Christ as well. And that's why he says, "If I'm being
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:14.720]   selfish, I'd rather die. The only reason why I would stay is because I want you to know
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:22.080]   this Christ as well." Now, did Paul have this love the moment he met Christ? No. He hated
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:32.240]   the Gentiles. In the context of obedience, God gave him love. So it was this love that
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:40.480]   compelled him. What gives us boldness? First, are you convicted that the gospel is true?
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:50.880]   And you say, "Oh, yeah, of course I believe it, you know." But really, enough to be uncomfortable,
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:59.440]   enough to overcome awkwardness? Are you convinced enough that this is the only salvation,
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:08.400]   only way that mankind could die and not be in judgment? Are we convinced of this truth?
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:16.640]   And if we are, when's the last time we pleaded on behalf of this perishing world?
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:23.440]   You know, there's a story of a monk named Telemachus. He was an early 5th century monk.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:31.600]   Even after the Roman Empire supposedly turned a Christian empire, the Colosseum and the
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:38.320]   gladiator fights kept on going on. And they fought to the death, as all of us know. So
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:43.680]   some of these were slaves. Some of these men were valiant warriors that were from another
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:50.240]   nation and they got conquered so they became gladiators, strictly for the purpose of entertainment.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:55.440]   Well, this monk happened to enter into the Colosseum, Telemachus, and he saw it and he
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:01.440]   was so grieved by what he saw, he entered and tried to stop it. And the crowd turned
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:07.520]   on him, saying, "What are you doing? Why are you judging us?" And they ended up stoning
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:16.080]   him publicly. Now, being this supposedly, superficially being a Christian empire, seeing
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:23.120]   a helpless monk stoned to death by this crowd, after it was done, they said there was a dead
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:28.800]   silence that came over everybody, horrified by what they saw. And as a result of that,
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:35.200]   the emperor of that period decided this is enough.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:42.080]   There's things happening today in our culture. All of you have probably seen these anti-abortion
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:46.800]   films that have been coming out, interviewing the executives of Planned Parenthood. And
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:51.280]   yesterday there was a huge rally, getting together in front of Planned Parenthood and
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:57.600]   protesting. And again, it's horrific things that's been going on in the last 50, 60 years
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:04.320]   of US history, all over the world. And now this collective outrage because of these videos,
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:10.880]   and rightfully so, it's horrific what we've been seeing. And so many people are outraged
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:17.280]   and up in arms, and we've been hearing this steady drumbeat on the internet, on television,
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:22.000]   on the radio, that something needs to be done. This is not just a Christian thing. It's
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:29.280]   not just a Republican thing. The Democrats alike, in fact, in our generation, they say
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:35.920]   that in the last 30 years, the tide toward homosexual marriage and to broad acceptance
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:41.360]   of homosexuality, we've been losing the war on that. And more and more people are readily
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:47.760]   accepting of that. But this abortion thing, some positive news, the tide has been turning.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:53.040]   I've read recently that majority of the people in the United States are actually against
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.680]   it. And you don't have to be a Christian to be against it. You just look at some of
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:01.120]   the pictures. Just logically speaking, how can you say that that's not a human being?
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:08.320]   So rightfully so, there is this outrage. We need to do something about this. But let's
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:17.360]   get some perspective. As horrific as that scene is, and being revealed, being exposed
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:24.720]   to this revelation of what's going on, there has been a steady drumbeat from the preaching
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:32.480]   of the Word of God that we neither be ashamed of the Gospel, for in it is the power of God
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:38.560]   for salvation to everyone who believes. In it is the righteousness of God revealed from
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:46.960]   faith to faith. And there has been a steady drumbeat for the last 2,000 years that if
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:57.200]   we are outraged and horrified by babies being mutilated, and yet be so numb as to the souls
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:02.560]   who are perishing every single day without even hearing the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:10.640]   you and I confess is the only way of salvation for mankind. And then to live every single
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:20.400]   day for the rest of our lives like everybody else. How can we be so outraged over one and
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:28.960]   be so numb over the other? There has been a steady drumbeat by the preaching of the
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:37.840]   Word of God, by the Gospel of Jesus Christ, by the groaning of the Holy Spirit. The world
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:44.400]   is in darkness that the Son of God came over His throne, being equal with God in every
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:52.080]   way, did not consider equality with God to be grasped, but became nothing, took on the
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:50:03.120]   form of a servant, became one of us, even put to death on a cross, humiliated. How can
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:13.360]   that not affect us? So the Scripture screams out, "Do not be ashamed of the Gospel. It
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:21.520]   is the power of God for salvation." Would you take a minute to pray with me together?
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:31.440]   I want to ask you bluntly, do you believe this truth? Are you convicted? And if you
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:40.240]   are, do you care? Jesus said, "The greatest commandment is love the Lord your God with
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:47.200]   all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself." So first
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:57.840]   question, am I convinced of this truth? Do I believe this? There is no half-hearted conviction,
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.960]   there's no half-hearted commitment, either you do or you don't. To come before the Lord
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:09.680]   with honest confession, to not to allow ourselves to just drift along with the rest of the generation,
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:14.480]   valuing what they value, rejoicing over what they rejoice over, being saddened over the
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:22.480]   same things that they're saddened over, but to come before the Lord in confession, "Forgive
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:31.720]   me for having a callous heart. Forgive me for forgetting about the lost. Forgive me
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:37.320]   for not being affected by what you've done for me." To confess that before the Lord
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:42.320]   and ask the Lord that the Holy Spirit would continue to grip us, that we would make the
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:46.280]   same confession. So let's take some time to pray as we invite our praise team to come
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.520]   up and lead us.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.840]   (splashing)
