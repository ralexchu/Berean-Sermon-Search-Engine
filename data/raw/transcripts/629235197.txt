[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   Hi, my name is Andrew.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.320]   I'm currently in BAM, and this is my testimony.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.240]   I was born into a Christian family in Irvine, California, and before I received Christ into
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.680]   my life, I lived knowing of Christ but not fully understanding the gravitas he had in
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.640]   my life and has in my life.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.800]   I was baptized as an infant and took this as an assurance in my salvation just because
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.280]   of my parents' belief.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.560]   Because of this, my faith and, importantly, my relationship with God was weak, if not
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.040]   void of all reliance or belief.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.280]   My time was my own, lacking any thanksgiving or praise to God.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.200]   Sunday services were two-hour chores that made me feel better about myself, and I did
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.920]   not seek his love and forgiveness in my daily life.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.440]   The relationship I had with him was stunted, relegated to a conversation before food or
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.840]   something bad happened in my life.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.260]   As I grew in the world, I slowly began to push the thought of him away, repulsed by
[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.360]   those who said they loved him, focusing more on school, career, and future earthly plans.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.120]   My misdirection led to an ungodly mentality that affected my relationship and my personal
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.120]   health.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.960]   I was unable to attain the results that I wanted, nor was I able to gain any sort of
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.360]   joy from beating others and, quote, "coming out on top."
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.240]   I yearned for the idealized version of a successful earthly life that ultimately failed me, leaving
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.920]   me feeling empty, weak, and alone.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.720]   I filled this void with profane language, anger, and partying, seeking to fill myself
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.560]   with something I thought I could find on this earth apart from God.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.240]   With poor decisions in relationships and friends, I was slowly pulled farther and farther away
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.680]   from my relationship with him and into the fleshly life that the world had slowly made
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.680]   me enjoy.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.200]   When I was at my worst, God brought a friend to my life my second year of college that
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.320]   really pushed me to change the worldly emphasis of my life and kept me accountable while I
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.080]   began repairing my relationship that I had severed with God.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.920]   It was at this time as well that I felt the true weight of his atonement for my sins,
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.120]   with that weight being lifted from my shoulders, making the faith my own, so to speak.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.720]   So reparations came in the form of reconciling with God, repenting for my wrongdoings and
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.200]   my past actions, and I felt secure in his forgiveness and full assurance of my place
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.060]   with him forever.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.000]   Those idealized versions of myself that I thought were the only way to find peace suddenly
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.240]   just now seemed so strange and twisted with the peace I had now found with God.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.240]   Through meeting those in the body, studying, and learning the word with them, I was able
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.800]   to build a stronger bond with his family and ultimately God.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.880]   After receiving Christ, many things that used to be chores became blessings.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.720]   As in Matthew 7, 17, "So every healthy tree bears good fruit, and the tree bears bad fruit,"
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.140]   I've seen the roots of my life removed from these earthly things that I loved and planted
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.140]   firmly in him.
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.940]   And as I grew within the community, I became healthier in my faith, bearing more fruit
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.840]   for the community that I served.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.800]   As my relationship with him matured, much of that fruit came in the form of serving
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.740]   the church and being a witness to others in their walks with God.
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.400]   As I progress in my faith, I continually look to build my relationship with God.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.600]   I learn and grow each day in devotion and in his word.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.320]   I no longer seek the approval of man or the riches of this world, but I wholly look to
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.460]   him for my peace and joy in life as I know that he is the ultimate source of my salvation.
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.720]   This led me to today, wanting to publicly proclaim my faith to Christ and my full life's
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.720]   dedication to him.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.720]   Thank you.
