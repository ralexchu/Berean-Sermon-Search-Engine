[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.680]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.680]   We will now begin our service.

[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   - All right, good morning.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   Welcome to Prairie Community Church.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   Let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   First of all, today is Women's Softball Fellowship
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.600]   that's happening in the park in Orange.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.600]   So if you are playing or if you're going to go watch,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   it's starting at two o'clock to five o'clock, okay?
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.600]   And for those of you who are playing,
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.600]   I think they're meeting at 1.30 just to give you a heads up.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   This coming week is all church praise and prayer,
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   and so we don't have regular Bible study.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   We have, instead, we're gonna be having
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   our praise and prayer time this Friday,
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.600]   so please try to come a little bit earlier
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.600]   so we can start right at 7.30.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.600]   India Pastor Support,
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   if you are interested in supporting them,
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.600]   $50 a month for the next year,
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   please sign up for that,
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   or you give a one-time donation of 600,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   and again, these fees will go to support
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   our village pastors out in India, okay?
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.600]   All right, so there's a few things.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.600]   One, the cleanup team has asked.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   They need more volunteers for June.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   I think part of it is because our Bible study is over now,
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.600]   but if you are part of a small group
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.600]   or home group that has not participated in that yet,
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.600]   we ask you to go sign up.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.520]   Or even if you haven't,
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.520]   they said that they need more people in June,
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.520]   so as you're exiting,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.520]   you'll see a table set up outside,
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.520]   so it says "Cleanup Team,"
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.520]   and go to that table, and if you sign up your name,
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.520]   and even if it's just one Sunday,
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.520]   just let them know that you can help out,
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.520]   and they usually do it before service
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.520]   on Sundays or after service,
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.520]   and so just sign your name up,
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.520]   and they'll give you instructions on that.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.520]   So as you're exiting, you'll see a table out there.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.520]   Along with that, the VBS sign-ups are also taking place,
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.520]   so please go to that table outside
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.520]   to sign up your children.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.520]   Then also for family retreat,
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.520]   that's coming up in August 16th to the 18th, June 2nd.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.520]   Next Sunday is the last day for early registration,
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.520]   so after that, it's going to be regular registration,
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.520]   meaning the price is going to go up, okay?
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.520]   So please sign up for that.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.520]   Again, all of these things are outside.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.520]   As you are exiting, you'll see a table outside,
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   so please sign up for that,
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   and then one last thing, the Bible study.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   I know we just ended,
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.520]   and the completion of Bible study
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.520]   isn't going to be until end of August,
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.520]   but we need plenty of time to prepare for the small group
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.520]   because the growing number of people in our church,
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.520]   we need to know exactly how many people
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.520]   that we need to prepare the home group
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.520]   and the Bible study for,
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.520]   and so please sign up for that as well.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   I don't think there's a table for that outside, right?
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   Yeah, but if you go online, just sign up for it.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   If you know that you're going to,
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.520]   please sign up for it.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.520]   That'll help us prepare way in advance, okay?
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.520]   I think that is it for this morning,
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.520]   and we're going to do an offering,
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.520]   and then afterwards, our sister Erica Shin
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.520]   is going to come up, give her testimony,
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.520]   and be baptized this morning.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.520]   All right, let's pray.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.520]   Heavenly Father,
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.520]   we thank you for who you are.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.520]   We thank you for your perseverance with us.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.520]   We thank you for the privilege
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.520]   that we have to come and worship you.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.520]   Lord, whatever it is
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.520]   that we have been entangled with,
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.520]   our hearts, our minds,
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.520]   that you would help us this morning
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.520]   that we would come in your presence
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.520]   with reverence,
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.520]   with joy, with thanksgiving,
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.520]   and all that we do
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.520]   and all that we give
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.520]   may be an overflow
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.520]   of your powerful work in us.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.520]   I pray, Lord God,
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.520]   that even this giving
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.520]   may be a reflection of our heart
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.520]   and our worship and devotion to you.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.520]   I pray for wisdom for the leaders
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.520]   to be able to handle your finances
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.520]   with integrity and may it be multiplied, Lord God,
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.520]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.520]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.440]   (soft piano music)
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   (soft piano music)

[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   - Let us all rise
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.200]   and let's spend a few moments just to greet
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   the neighbors around us.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   (soft piano music)

[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.120]   (upbeat music)

[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.120]   (upbeat music)

[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.120]   - Good morning, church family, and happy Sunday.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.120]   My name is Erica, and this is my testimony.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.120]   Like many others, I grew up in the church,
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.120]   but was not genuinely saved until much later.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.120]   I called myself a Christian growing up
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.120]   because I falsely assumed attending church,
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.120]   believing in the mere existence of God,
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.120]   and adhering to worldly morals
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.120]   were equivalent to being a believer.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.120]   With this false sense of security,
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.120]   I'd even got baptized before in middle school.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.120]   In actuality, I couldn't have been further
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.120]   from God and the truth.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.120]   Looking back, I viewed church as purely a social setting
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.120]   without taking into consideration
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.120]   any sort of personal relationship with God.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.120]   I knew about God, but didn't truly know his character
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.120]   as I had no desire to spend time with him
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.120]   in word or in prayer.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.120]   I couldn't truly comprehend his love and grace,
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.120]   and instead thought salvation was earned through works.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.120]   I used what I perceived as my own
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.120]   upstanding moral track record to be legalistic
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.120]   and act like a Pharisee toward others.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.120]   I was extremely prideful and judgmental,
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.120]   especially toward my peers at church
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.120]   as I held those who professed being Christian
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.120]   to an unfairly high standard
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.120]   without examining if I was even one myself.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   When my peers naturally didn't meet
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.120]   my impossibly high expectations of moral perfection,
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.120]   I condemned them and grew embittered
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.120]   with the church for being hypocritical.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   What I failed to realize was that I was no better than them
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.120]   because at the end of the day,
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.120]   I was righteous and was unrepentant of my sins.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.120]   But by the time I graduated high school,
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.120]   I was so disappointed with my experience with the church
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.120]   that I decided Christianity wasn't for me.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.120]   However, God had other plans.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.120]   A couple months into college,
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.120]   I stumbled across a fellowship.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.120]   Despite my past bitterness,
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.120]   being in a church setting felt familiar and comforting
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.120]   in a season of transition and homesickness,
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.120]   so I found myself staying
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.120]   and started attending church regularly again.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.120]   While I was initially drawn to the fellowship
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.120]   for personal reasons, through the grace of God,
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.120]   he slowly opened my eyes
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.120]   to recognize the gravity of my sin
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.120]   and my desperate need for a savior while I was there.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.120]   It's hard to pinpoint the exact moment when I was saved,
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   but I was reconciled to Christ
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.120]   through a continual series of convictions
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.120]   and other moments of spiritual growth
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.120]   that steadily unfolded throughout the course of college.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   Little by little, I learned more about God
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.120]   and his perfect, loving, merciful character,
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   and he graciously instilled a desire in me
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.120]   to embrace and pursue a relationship with him.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.120]   After I graduated college and moved back home,
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.120]   God brought me to Berean,
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.120]   where he has been growing me even closer to him
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.120]   for the past two years.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.120]   It has been a humbling but sweet and sanctifying journey
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.120]   as God has been teaching me
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.120]   how to joyfully submit to his will.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.120]   One of those ways is through baptism.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.120]   As I mentioned before,
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.120]   I was baptized before in my youth,
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.120]   but looking back,
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.120]   I don't think I was a genuine believer.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.120]   However, God has been putting it on my heart
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.120]   to revisit this topic and really take the time
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.120]   to think through and examine the state of my heart back then.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.120]   Looking back,
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.120]   I hadn't genuinely accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior,
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.120]   and I had no repentance of my sins.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.120]   After much prayer and reflection,
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.120]   I felt convicted to get baptized again,
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.120]   this time as a genuine believer,
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.120]   which leads me to this morning.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.120]   I'm excited to get baptized today
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.120]   to indicate my full obedience to his will
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.120]   and desire to use my life for his glory.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.120]   I want to close with Romans 12, 1-2.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.120]   "There I urge you, brethren,
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.120]   "by the mercies of God,
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.120]   "to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.120]   "acceptable to God,
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.120]   "which is your spiritual service of worship.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.120]   "And do not be conformed to this world,
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.120]   "but be transformed by the renewing of your mind
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.120]   "so that you may prove what the will of God is,
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.120]   "that which is good and acceptable and perfect."
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.120]   Thank you.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.120]   (applause)
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.040]   (water splashing)
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   - Erika, do you understand when you're going into the water,
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.040]   you're being united to Christ's death?
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.040]   When you're coming out, you're being united
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.040]   to his resurrected life? - Yes.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.040]   - And I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.040]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.040]   (water splashing)
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   (applause)
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   - All right, thank you, Erika,
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.040]   for that encouraging testimony.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.040]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke 8,
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.040]   and I will read starting from verse 11
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.040]   out of the NASB, Luke 8.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.960]   Starting from verse 11.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.960]   "Now the parable is this.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.960]   "The seed is the word of God.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.960]   "Those beside the road are those who have heard.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.960]   "Then the devil comes and takes away
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.960]   "the word from their hearts
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.960]   "so that they will not believe and be saved.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.960]   "Those on the rocky soil are those who,
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.960]   "when they hear, receive the word with joy,
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.960]   "and these have no firm root.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.960]   "They believe for a while,
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.960]   "and in time of temptation fall away.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   "The seed which fell among the thorns,
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.960]   "these are the ones who have heard.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.960]   "As they go on their way,
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.960]   "they are choked with worries and riches
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.960]   "and pleasures of this life,
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.960]   "and bring no fruit to maturity.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.960]   "But the seed in the good soil,
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.960]   "these are the ones who have heard the word
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.960]   "in an honest and good heart,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.960]   "and hold it fast and bear fruit with perseverance."
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.960]   Let's pray.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.960]   Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   We pray for eager hearts
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.960]   that we may receive it to be molded
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.960]   and to apply according to Your will and purpose.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.960]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.960]   If you've been at our church for a while,
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.960]   you probably have played this game,
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   "Two Truths and a Lie," right?
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.960]   You guys know that game?
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.960]   Pastor Mark actually likes playing that game.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.960]   So when newcomers come to the church,
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.960]   it's one of the things that we play
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.960]   to get to know each other better.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.960]   And basically, "Two Truths and a Lie"
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.960]   is you tell two lies and one truth,
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.960]   or the other way,
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.960]   and try to figure out which one's a truth
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.960]   and which one's a lie.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.960]   So I'm going to play this game with you,
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.960]   and you tell me which one is true
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.960]   and which one is a lie, okay?
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   One, I played center
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.960]   for a high school varsity team
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.960]   when I was in high school.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.960]   Don't laugh.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.960]   Number two, I was a golf pro in college.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.960]   Then I gave it up after college.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.960]   And third, I was the first one
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.960]   to build a computer back in the '80s
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   among my friends.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   I didn't invent it,
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.960]   but I built it back in the '80s.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.960]   Now, which one's true and which one's a lie?
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   Okay, how many of you think
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.960]   that number one is a truth?
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.960]   Ha, you liars.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.960]   All right, that's a lie, all right.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.960]   How many of you think it's number two,
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.960]   that I was a pro golfer before
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   back in college?
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.960]   Okay, how many of you believe
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   that it's number three?
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.960]   Okay, so the rest of you think
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   I'm lying about everything, right?
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.960]   Which would be right, right?
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.960]   All lies.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.960]   Now, if you look at what I said,
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.960]   you know, obviously, center for high school.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.960]   Are you kidding?
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.960]   That I was the center of which high school was this, right?
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.960]   So whether you know me or not,
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.960]   it's pretty obvious that there's no way
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.960]   I was gonna play center in any high school, right?
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   Maybe even not in junior high school, right?
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.960]   Two, golf.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.960]   Yeah, it's a possibility, maybe, right?
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.960]   You could play.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   I mean, some of you who may have seen me play golf
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.960]   say, "Wait, that guy played golf," right?
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.960]   So it's pretty obvious it wasn't number two.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.960]   Three, maybe a possibility.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.960]   Why not?
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.960]   Back in the '80s when it first started coming in,
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.960]   you know, could be a possibility.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   But anybody who knows me even a little, right,
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.960]   knows that that's not my strength.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.960]   In fact, among our pastors,
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.960]   I'm the computer illiterate.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.960]   I still write my sermons on paper
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.960]   and I have to transfer it over
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   because I picked up computers so late.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   So all of these things are lies, right?
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.960]   But depending on how well you know me,
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   you would have known that.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   I think Pastor Nate would have, you know,
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.960]   known immediately that none of these things were true, right?
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.960]   We live in a culture today
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   that if somebody claims to be something,
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   that we're not allowed to question it, right?
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.960]   If they genuinely believe it.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   What if I told you that I genuinely believe this?
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.960]   I genuinely believe I was a center.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   I genuinely believe that I was a pro golfer.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.960]   I genuinely believe, like, I'm convinced
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.960]   that I was the first to create the computer among my friends.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.960]   You would laugh at me.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.960]   It doesn't matter what you genuinely believe
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.960]   because it's not true.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.960]   Again, we live in a culture today
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.960]   if a guy in every way is a man
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.960]   and he says he's a female
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.960]   and if we question them, we're a bigot.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.960]   I mean, it's just gone mad, our culture, right?
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.960]   What is true is true, what is false is false.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.960]   But I'm not worried about what's happening
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.960]   outside in the culture, right?
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.960]   I mean, they don't believe God
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.960]   and they've given into just pursuing that
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.960]   and as ridiculous as that is,
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.960]   I'm not as concerned about what's happening out there.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.960]   What I'm concerned about is what's happening in the church.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.960]   We live in a culture where if somebody
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   who's acting like a duck,
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.960]   smelling like a duck, talks like a duck
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.960]   and then he says he's a chicken
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.960]   and if we don't give the benefit of the doubt
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.880]   okay, if you say you're a duck, you're going to be a duck.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   That we're being judgmental, we're legalists.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.880]   If you don't act like a Christian,
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.880]   you don't live like a Christian,
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.880]   you don't talk like a Christian,
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.880]   you don't sleep like a Christian
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.880]   and they say, "Are you a Christian?"
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.880]   How dare you question me?
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.880]   How dare you?
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.880]   If I say I am,
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.880]   if I believe that I am,
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.880]   who are you to question me?
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.880]   The parable that we're looking at,
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.880]   that's exactly what Jesus is doing
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   because the multitudes are coming to him
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   in numbers, in hundreds, in thousands
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.880]   and he is cutting right through that
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   and he says, "Many of these people who are coming to me
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.880]   are confessing me, but they're not true believers."
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.880]   And he said, "Repeat it.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.880]   Not everyone who calls me Lord, Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.880]   Not everybody who's coming to me
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.880]   and wanting to see me, be near me
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.880]   have genuine faith and eventually they will fall out
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.880]   and you will recognize them."
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.880]   And he's preparing his disciples
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.880]   to decipher between true believers
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.880]   and false believers.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.880]   And so again, we live in a culture today
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.880]   if somebody is acting like a duck,
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.880]   talking like a duck,
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.880]   smelling like a duck
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.880]   and he said, "Maybe you're a duck."
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.880]   How dare you?
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.880]   Tell me how that is so much different
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.880]   than what's going on in the world today.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.880]   The Bible makes it very clear.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.880]   In fact, the text that we've been looking at
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.880]   has been telling us
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.880]   how to identify true believers.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   The first soil,
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.880]   it comes and falls on the side of the road
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.880]   and because there's no soil on it,
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.880]   it dies immediately.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.880]   They reject Christ,
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.880]   "I don't believe this, this is nonsense"
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.880]   and they walk away.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.880]   The second soil falls on rocky soil
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.880]   but because it doesn't have any foundation
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.880]   they receive it immediately with joy
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.880]   but because there's no root
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.880]   eventually it'll wither and it dies
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.880]   and the church in many cases
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.880]   are filled with the second soil people.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.880]   Third soil is a little bit more difficult.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.880]   They receive it,
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.880]   they begin to grow, it looks like
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.880]   but the weeds
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.880]   and the thorns eventually grow with it
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.880]   and it says the worries
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.880]   and concerns of life begin to choke it
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.880]   and the Word of God
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.880]   is no longer bearing fruit
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.880]   and they also eventually wither and die
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.880]   and that's where we have the problem.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.880]   We have people who are basically withered and die
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.880]   and no longer following the teachings of Christ
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.880]   and yet he said,
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880]   "I'm not sure, you're not acting like a Christian,
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.880]   you're not talking like a Christian,
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.880]   you're not behaving like a Christian,
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.880]   are you a Christian?
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.880]   How dare you question me?"
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.880]   Well, that's exactly what Jesus was saying.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.880]   The good soil are the people
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.880]   who hear the Word of God
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.880]   and with an honest and good conscience
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.880]   they hear the Word of God.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.880]   In other words, they get convicted by their sin
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.880]   and then they receive it,
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.880]   they repent
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.880]   and it says they hold it fast
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.880]   meaning that they begin
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.880]   to get connected to the soil,
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.880]   they begin to grow
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:47.880]   and then it says last week
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.880]   that they bear fruit.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.880]   He said those are the factors
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.880]   that determine if somebody
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.880]   is a genuine believer or not.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.880]   Repentance, acceptance,
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.880]   growth, bearing fruit
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:00.880]   and then the final one,
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.880]   he says they will persevere
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   in bearing this fruit.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.800]   I'm going to give you three things
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.800]   about perseverance
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   and I believe that this
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   is the greatest evidence
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.800]   of salvation is the perseverance
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   according to Scripture.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   One, the ultimate proof of salvation
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.800]   is our perseverance.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   Ultimate proof of salvation
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.800]   is our perseverance.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.800]   Not somebody who started the race,
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.800]   again, the church is filled
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   with people, it's like,
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   "Oh, I remember 10 years ago,
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   15 years ago, 20 years ago."
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   Not somebody who started the race
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.800]   but someone who finishes it.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   1 John 2, verse 19, it says,
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   "They went out from us
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.800]   but they were not really of us.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.800]   For if they had been of us,
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   they would have remained with us
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.800]   but they went out
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.800]   so that it would be shown
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   that they are all not of us."
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   He said the proof,
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.800]   whether somebody really
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.800]   is part of the universal church
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   is a child of God
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   is that they persevere
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   and they remain.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.800]   When you look at the text,
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   it says they left us
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.800]   because they were not of us.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   Them leaving proved
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.800]   that they were never really of us
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   to begin with.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.800]   In other words,
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.800]   their not persevering
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.800]   revealed where their faith really was
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   because there's all kinds of reasons
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.800]   why somebody would come to church.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   For social reasons,
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.800]   out of habit, tradition,
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   family loyalty,
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.800]   there's all kinds of reasons
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   why people come to church.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.800]   But it says eventually,
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   if you do not have true faith,
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   you will not persevere.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.720]   Look at that text and it says,
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   "Well, I never left."
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.720]   Is this talking about somebody
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   who stays in the church?
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.720]   As long as you stay in the church,
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.720]   that's proof that you're a Christian.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.720]   Obviously, that's not
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   what he's referring to.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.720]   Let's understand
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.720]   what perseverance means.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.720]   He says in verse 15,
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   "And hold it fast
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.720]   and bear fruit with perseverance."
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.720]   Perseverance and bearing fruit
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.720]   go hand in hand.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.720]   He's not just talking about somebody
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.720]   who never leaves the church.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.720]   It's obvious if somebody
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.720]   leaves the church,
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.720]   but you could be in the church
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.720]   and never bear fruit.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.720]   Perseverance is connected
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.720]   to bearing fruit.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.720]   The word for persevere
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.720]   in the Greek is "hupomone."
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.720]   The word "hupomone"
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.720]   basically means
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.720]   to remain under pressure.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.720]   To remain under pressure.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.720]   When you are tested,
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.720]   you persevere,
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   just like it says
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.720]   in the book of James, chapter 1.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.720]   Persevere in pure joy
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.720]   when you encounter
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.720]   trials of many kinds.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.720]   Because testing of your faith
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   will produce perseverance.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.720]   And perseverance,
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.720]   when it is complete,
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.720]   causes you to have character.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.720]   Complete in every way.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.720]   So he says,
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.720]   a genuine believer,
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.720]   when he is tested,
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.720]   actually causes them
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.720]   to have more
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.720]   and growing and pure faith.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.720]   But an unbeliever,
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.720]   who is just hanging around
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.720]   at the church,
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.720]   who is holding on
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.720]   to a form of godliness,
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.720]   coming for tradition
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.720]   or superstition,
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.720]   as soon as a relationship
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:09.720]   goes sour,
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.720]   as soon as the church
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.720]   becomes inconvenient
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.720]   and it doesn't do
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.720]   whatever it is
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.720]   they think they want it to do,
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   they're done.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.720]   They might not be
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.720]   physically done
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.720]   because there's too much
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.720]   contribution,
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.720]   too much price to pay
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.720]   to leave the church.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.720]   It's much easier
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.720]   for a nominal Christian
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.720]   just to hang on
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.720]   so that they can benefit
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.720]   from the culture of the church
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   without ever really knowing Christ.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.720]   So the word for persevere
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.720]   means to continue
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   under this pressure.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   And so in some
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.720]   of your translations
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.720]   that word for persevere
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.720]   is translated patience.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   You don't need patience
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.720]   when things are going great.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.720]   What do you need patience for?
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.720]   If everything is going
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.720]   according to plan,
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.720]   you don't need patience.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.720]   Patience requires
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.720]   when you are tested
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   and you are tempted to move
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.720]   and you choose to stay.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.720]   That's the word patience
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.720]   and that's the word here
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.720]   for perseverance
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.720]   that in the midst of trial
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.720]   that you continue
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.720]   to bear fruit
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.720]   and that's why
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.720]   the distinction
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.720]   between a Christian
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.720]   and a non-Christian
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.720]   it uses the word overcome
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.720]   which is another word
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.720]   for perseverance.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.720]   1 John 5, 4-5
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.720]   for whatever is born of God
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.720]   overcomes the world
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.720]   and this is the victory
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.720]   that has overcome the world
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.720]   our faith.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.720]   Who is the one
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.720]   who overcomes the world
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.720]   but he who believes
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.720]   that Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.720]   So in other words
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.720]   he says if you believe
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.720]   that Jesus is the Son of God
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.720]   you will overcome the world
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.720]   and what he means
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   by overcoming the world
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.720]   he means that you will not
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.720]   give in to the temptation
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.720]   of the world.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   That your life
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.720]   is not in the pattern
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.720]   of the world.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.720]   That's what the word
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.720]   overcome means
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.720]   and again it is
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.720]   the same word
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   or understanding
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.720]   as the word
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   hupomenai
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.720]   to remain under
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.720]   to continue.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.720]   In the book
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   of Revelation
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   there's seven letters
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.720]   that are written
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.720]   to the churches
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.720]   and at the end
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   of these seven letters
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.720]   each one of them
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   describing
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.720]   the concern
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.720]   that Jesus has
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.720]   over these churches
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.720]   so the only one
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.720]   that doesn't receive rebuke
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.720]   is the church
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.720]   of Philadelphia
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.720]   and they're bearing fruit
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.720]   but they're under
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.720]   heavy persecution
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.720]   and at the end
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.640]   of these letters
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.640]   he says
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.640]   he who overcomes
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.640]   he who overcomes
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.640]   in other words
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.640]   he who overcomes
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   this problem
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.640]   in Revelation 2-7
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.640]   you know the church
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.640]   where he rebukes them
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.640]   for forsaking
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.640]   their first love
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.640]   that on the surface
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.640]   that they're doing
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.640]   all the right things
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.640]   with right doctrine
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.640]   but he says
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.640]   you have forsaken
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.640]   your first love
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.640]   and he says
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.640]   if you do not repent
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.640]   and redo the things
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.640]   that you did at first
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   he said I will remove
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.640]   your lampstand
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.640]   and then he says
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.640]   to the churches
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.640]   to him who overcomes
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.640]   I will grant to eat
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   of the tree of the life
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.640]   which is in the paradise
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.640]   of God
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.640]   so here when he says
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.640]   to overcome
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.640]   he's talking about
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.640]   somebody who recognizes
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.640]   that you're just
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   going through the motion
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640]   that Christ
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   is not your first love
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.640]   so he who overcomes
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.640]   that
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.640]   he says
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.640]   is evidence
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.640]   of genuine faith
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.640]   church of Smyrna
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.640]   Revelation 2-11
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   in the midst
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.640]   of heavy persecution
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.640]   he said
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.640]   he who has an ear
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.640]   let him hear
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.640]   what the spirit
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.640]   says to the churches
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.640]   he who overcomes
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.640]   by the second death
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.640]   and then
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.640]   in church
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.640]   of Pergamum
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.640]   overcome
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.640]   the temptation
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.640]   to compromise
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.640]   with the world
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.640]   he says
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.640]   he who overcomes
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.640]   this temptation
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.640]   will be saved
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:36.640]   Thyatira
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.640]   he who overcomes
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.640]   the temptation
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.640]   of wrong doctrine
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.640]   and sexual sin
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.640]   he says
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   he will have confidence
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.640]   that he will be saved
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.640]   in the church
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.640]   of Sardis
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.640]   he who overcomes
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.640]   temptations
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.640]   to fall spiritually
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:49.640]   asleep
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.640]   that you have
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.640]   a reputation
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.640]   of being alive
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.640]   but in God's eyes
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.640]   you are dead
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.640]   he says
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.640]   he who overcomes
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.640]   that
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.640]   will be saved
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.640]   church of Philadelphia
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.640]   is the church
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.640]   the only church
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.640]   that has no rebuke
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.640]   and he says
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:04.640]   if you overcome
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.640]   temptation
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   to quit
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.640]   and you continue
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.640]   in the context
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.640]   of persecution
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.640]   and continue
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.640]   in your good works
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.640]   you will overcome
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.640]   and then the church
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:14.640]   of Laodicea
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.640]   that we know
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.640]   very well
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.640]   to overcome
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.640]   the temptation
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:19.640]   of self-reliance
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.640]   and lukewarmness
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.640]   so the idea
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.640]   of just remaining
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.640]   in your seats
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.640]   and not denying Christ
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.640]   and just continuing
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.640]   to come to church
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.640]   the idea of perseverance
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.640]   just like he says
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:31.640]   in verse 15
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.640]   he perseveres
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.640]   in bearing fruit
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.640]   perseverance
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.640]   in doing right
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.640]   perseverance
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.640]   in pursuing righteousness
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.640]   the greatest evidence
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.640]   of the genuineness
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.640]   of our faith
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.640]   is not
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   that we started this race
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.640]   but that we finished
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.640]   this race
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.640]   in Matthew 24
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.640]   10-13
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.640]   he says
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.640]   at that time
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.640]   many will fall away
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.640]   and will betray
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.640]   one another
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.640]   and hate one another
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:02.640]   many false prophets
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.640]   will arise
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.640]   and will mislead many
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.640]   because the lawlessness
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.640]   is increased
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.640]   most people's love
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.640]   will grow cold
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.640]   but the one
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.640]   who endures
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.640]   or overcomes
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:12.640]   to the end
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.640]   he will be saved
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.640]   he says
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.640]   because
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.640]   the increase of wickedness
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.640]   most people's love
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:23.640]   will grow cold
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.640]   now when Jesus says this
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.640]   and he's warning the church
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.640]   that there's going
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.640]   to come a time
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.640]   before he comes
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.640]   that this is going
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.640]   to happen
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.640]   you're going to see
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.640]   evil
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.640]   in such a way
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.640]   that you're going
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.640]   to be shocked
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.640]   and I think
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.640]   we're living
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.640]   in that time now
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.640]   it is shocking
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.640]   what they consider
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.640]   righteousness
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.640]   it is shocking
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.640]   that you would allow
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.640]   a full grown male
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.560]   in a locker room
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.560]   with a three year old
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.560]   and then if you question
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.560]   that you're the bigot
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.560]   the bible tells us
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.560]   that there will come
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.560]   a time
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.560]   when these things
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.560]   will happen
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.560]   and it is today
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.560]   but he didn't say this
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.560]   to warn us
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.560]   about the world
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.560]   he said this
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.560]   to warn the church
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.560]   that when you see
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.560]   that happening
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.560]   most people's love
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.560]   will grow cold
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.560]   he was warning
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.560]   the church
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.560]   in the context
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.560]   of wickedness
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.560]   that is happening outside
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.560]   be concerned
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.560]   with your own heart
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.560]   that you do not grow cold
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   that you do not compromise
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.560]   that you yourself
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.560]   are not affected
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.560]   by what is happening
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.560]   but the one who endures
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.560]   to the end
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.560]   he will be saved
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.560]   the one who perseveres
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.560]   fights against it
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.560]   and there is a place
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.560]   where you and I
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.560]   are living
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.560]   in a country
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.560]   where we have a voice
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.560]   where we can speak
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.560]   we can vote
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.560]   we can protest
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.560]   and we ought to
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.560]   because we live
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.560]   in a free country
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.560]   that is how the system
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.560]   in the United States works
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.560]   so Christians
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.560]   who stay silent
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.560]   and do not vote
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.560]   have no voice
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.560]   but the primary concern
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.560]   is with the church
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.560]   because the sanctification
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.560]   and the salvation
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.560]   of the world
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.560]   is not going to happen
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.560]   simply because we protest
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.560]   because the primary way
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.560]   that Christ
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.560]   has brought salvation
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.560]   to this world
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.560]   is through the church
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.560]   if the church
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.560]   acts like the church
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.560]   he says that the greatest
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.560]   evidence of salvation
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.560]   is perseverance
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.560]   in righteousness
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.560]   perseverance
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.560]   in bearing fruit
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.560]   perseverance
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.560]   in the midst of trials
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.560]   that is number one
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.560]   number two
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.560]   you may listen to that
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.560]   and say
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.560]   well how am I going
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.560]   to do this
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.560]   are we like the Jehovah's Witnesses
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.560]   now we got to prove
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.560]   we got to prove
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.560]   our salvation
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.560]   with our works
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.560]   he says no
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.560]   you will persevere
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.560]   and the reason
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.560]   why you will persevere
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.560]   is because the scripture says
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.560]   that he's the one
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.560]   who justifies
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.560]   and he's the one
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.560]   who will sanctify
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.560]   we will persevere
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.560]   because God
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.560]   is the one
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.560]   who will cause us
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.560]   to persevere
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.560]   in Philippians 1.6
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.560]   it says
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.560]   I am confident
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.560]   of this very thing
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.560]   that he who began
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   a good work in you
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.560]   will perfect it
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.560]   until the day
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.560]   of Christ Jesus
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.560]   he will perfect it
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.560]   if genuine work
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.560]   has begun
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.560]   if genuine faith
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.560]   is what you have
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.560]   and he justified you
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.560]   he will sanctify you
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.560]   he will cause you
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.560]   to persevere
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.560]   in John chapter 10
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.560]   27-28
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.560]   my sheep
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.560]   hear my voice
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.560]   and I know them
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.560]   and they follow me
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.560]   and I give them
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:30.560]   eternal life to them
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.560]   and they will never perish
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.560]   and no one
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.560]   will snatch them
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.560]   out of my hand
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.560]   you notice here
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.560]   it says
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.560]   my sheep
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.560]   should follow me
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   he says no
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.560]   they will follow me
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.560]   I don't know
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.560]   if you've spent
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.560]   any time with sheep
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.560]   right
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.560]   I'm pretty sure
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:46.560]   that most of us
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.560]   have not
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.560]   I remember this
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.560]   during back in college
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   the college ministry
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.560]   I belong to
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.560]   went up
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.560]   to Oregon
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.560]   and we spent
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.560]   two weeks
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.560]   at a
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.560]   retreat center
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.560]   and they just
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.560]   happened to raise sheep
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.560]   they had about
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.560]   a hundred sheep
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.560]   and all the brothers
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.560]   you know
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.560]   we had to go
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.560]   down to the field
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.560]   and we did quiet time
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.560]   for two weeks
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.560]   basically watching the sheep
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.560]   at least I did
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.560]   and there's two things
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.560]   that I learned
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.560]   about these sheep
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.560]   is they are extremely
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.560]   dumb
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.560]   they're
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:16.560]   dumb
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.560]   and they get
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.560]   startled so
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.560]   quickly
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.560]   and you just
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.560]   snap your finger
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.560]   and one of them
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.560]   gets it
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.560]   you don't need
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.560]   all of them
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.560]   startled
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.560]   one of them
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.560]   gets startled
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.560]   and everybody
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.560]   just starts running
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.560]   right
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.560]   and so
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.560]   you can
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:34.560]   so it's
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:35.560]   you know
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:36.560]   if you have
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.560]   a mischievous
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.560]   personality
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.560]   like mine
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.560]   it was just
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.560]   fun watching them
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.560]   and there's a story
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.560]   of how this man
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.560]   who had a sheep farm
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.560]   and how he lost
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.560]   a hundred of his sheep
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.560]   because one of the
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.560]   sheep ended up
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.560]   going to the cliff
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.560]   and slipped
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.560]   and jumped off
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.560]   and as a result
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   all the other sheep
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.560]   started following
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.560]   and they jumped off
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.560]   right
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.560]   and the parents
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.560]   always say
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.560]   if your friends
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.560]   jump off the cliff
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.560]   are you going to
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:02.560]   jump off the cliff
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.560]   and the sheep
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.560]   says yes
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.560]   right
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:06.560]   and that's what
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.560]   happened
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:08.560]   and the only reason
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.560]   that the others
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.560]   didn't die
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.560]   is because they
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.560]   landed on top
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.560]   of the sheep
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.560]   that's how dumb
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.560]   they are
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.560]   they're dumb
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.560]   right
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.560]   number two
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.560]   the second thing
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.560]   that I learned
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:21.560]   is they're
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.560]   completely helpless
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.560]   they're completely
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.560]   helpless
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.560]   so if a wolf
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.560]   or a prey
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.560]   comes
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:28.560]   I mean
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.560]   because
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.560]   they don't know
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.560]   how to defend
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.560]   themselves
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.560]   that's why
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.560]   when they hear
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.560]   the shepherd's
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.560]   voice
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.560]   the shepherd's
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.560]   voice
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.560]   isn't simply
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:40.560]   to be alive
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.560]   it's to be near
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:42.560]   the shepherd
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.560]   so Jesus
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.560]   is using
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.560]   that illustration
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:46.560]   to say
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.560]   my sheep
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   who sometimes
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.560]   is dumb
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.560]   and is
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.560]   very
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.560]   helpless
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.560]   when they
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.560]   hear my
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.560]   voice
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.560]   they will follow
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.560]   not only
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:58.560]   will they follow
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.560]   it says
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.560]   I will give them
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.560]   eternal life
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.560]   they will never
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.560]   perish
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.560]   they will never
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.560]   perish
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.560]   because our
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.560]   shepherd will
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.560]   protect us
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.560]   I will snatch him
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.560]   out of my hand
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.560]   he says
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.560]   you will persevere
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.560]   if Jesus
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.560]   is your shepherd
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:15.560]   in John 6
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.560]   37
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.560]   all that the father
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.560]   gives me
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.560]   will come to me
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.560]   whoever
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.560]   the father
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.560]   gives me
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.560]   will come to me
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.560]   and the one
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.560]   who comes to me
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:26.560]   I will certainly
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.560]   not cast out
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   I'm not going
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.560]   to lose them
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.560]   if the father
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:31.560]   gave me
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.560]   them
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.560]   I will not
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.560]   lose them
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.560]   Romans 8
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.560]   38 to 39
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.560]   for I am convinced
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.560]   that the Lord
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.560]   will not
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.560]   cast us
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.560]   out
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   if he
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.560]   will not
