[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   The goal of this Bible study is to get you to study it and to kind of guide you through.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.040]   So I am going to give you some guidance.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.680]   I'm going to answer some of your questions.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.120]   So hopefully my guidance is going to give you some direction as to where the text is
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.800]   going, what to highlight, what to point, what are some hermeneutical principles as we are
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.800]   studying through it that you should know.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.920]   The majority of it is going to be you doing your homework and coming.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.840]   So just to kind of give you a heads up, and I'm going to tell you this again next week,
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.120]   when you come next week, you're going to start with your small group.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.560]   You're going to get into your small group and you're going to start with your small
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.560]   group.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.780]   So if you're in a habit of coming 10, 15 minutes late, you're going to miss your small group
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.240]   every single week.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.960]   If you can't come for whatever the reason, let your small group leaders know ahead of
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.520]   time so that they'll know that you're getting off work late and you're always going to be
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.480]   here at 7.15 or however that's going to work.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.840]   But if you're just kind of coming in, strolling in late because you grabbed dinner and you
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.140]   went to go get some boba or something and you're always coming 10, 15 minutes late,
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.400]   the Bible study format is going to be in such a way where you're going to miss a good chunk
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.720]   of what the Bible study is if you miss that part of it.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.920]   So I'm just going to give you a heads up.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.600]   I don't mean to scare all of you, but again, the purpose of this Bible study is to get
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.000]   you to kind of know what it is that you signed up for.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.600]   So today's Bible study, I'm just going to give you an overview.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.080]   And then I'm going to have you guys get into your groups and do some study on your own.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.080]   Let me pray first and then we'll jump right in.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.640]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for the blessing that we have in you.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.720]   We thank you for your living word that causes us to see you, to understand your heart.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.960]   We pray, Father God, that your thoughts, your intentions, your will, all of it, Lord, would
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.000]   be revealed as we study your word.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   We pray for your blessing.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.760]   And I know that many of us may come into this room already distracted because of work and
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.800]   various things that are going on in our lives.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.680]   I pray that our refreshment may be found in your word, that it would be an opportunity
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.360]   for us to recalibrate our thoughts and priorities according to your word.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.360]   We pray for your blessing and your Holy Spirit's guidance.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.360]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.360]   Amen.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.360]   All right.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:47.560]   Oh, it's working back here.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.640]   Okay.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.640]   All right.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.280]   So all of this is on your, you know, the two-page outline that you have.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.480]   That's all on there so you don't need to take any notes.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.400]   I wanted you to have this because you're going to have to use this for your study.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.080]   So hold on to this, but I'm going to go over it real quick.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:21.280]   First of all, I'm going to introduce you to the purpose of the class.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.780]   It's to learn how to study the Bible on your own without having to depend on others to
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.440]   feed you.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.640]   So unlike the other Bible studies and Sunday messages, the purpose of this is to get you
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.080]   into the word of God.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.280]   And being a listener isn't enough.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:45.920]   Again, I forgot the exact numbers, but you know, there's listening, there's reading,
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.440]   there's memorizing, there's meditation.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.440]   I forgot one.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.440]   Teaching.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:03.740]   Anyway, so the listening portion of it, if the only intake of God's word is listening,
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.960]   the retention of God's word is probably less than 3%.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.620]   And then as time goes by, whether it's a month or two months, it's less and less.
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.240]   That means a very small portion.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   As much as so many of you said that Leviticus was eye-opening, if all you remember from
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.480]   that is from what you heard, give it about six months and it's going to be very, very
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.480]   vague to you.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.840]   You're not going to retain any of that.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.680]   And so the goal of this is to get you into the word of God so that you don't say, "You
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.080]   know what?
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.160]   The church hasn't been teaching me the word of God."
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.800]   You shouldn't be starving to death because you haven't heard God's word in a while.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.480]   Because you have God's living word.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.920]   So you know the saying, "Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day, teach him how to fish
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.680]   and get him off your back to stop begging other people for food."
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.020]   So something like that.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.100]   So that's our goal, is to get you off my back.
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.700]   So B, to handle the word of God carefully and accurately.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.360]   First Timothy 4.16 and second Timothy 2.15.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.740]   I'm not going to read that now, but basically Paul says to teach the word of God, to watch
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.660]   your life in doctrine carefully.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.180]   And so we want to make sure that what we understand of God's word is not dependent upon the culture
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.180]   you're at.
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.540]   So if you're born in a Baptist church, you become a Baptist.
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.480]   If you happen to go to a Presbyterian church, you're a Presbyterian.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.860]   You shouldn't make doctrinal convictions based upon your environment and who you like and
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.660]   what pastor you like to hear.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.720]   It should be based upon what you see in God's word.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.020]   And so you have to be able to handle the word of God and even at times to disagree with me.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.900]   If you never disagree with anything that I've ever said, you're probably not studying the
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.620]   word of God.
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.820]   Because I've sent some controversial stuff.
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.060]   So if you disagree with anything I've ever said and you've been here more than two, three
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.580]   years, you're probably not thinking critically.
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.180]   I'm not asking you to disagree with me.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.760]   I'm just asking you to think critically.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.900]   The word of God has to be understood in this order.
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.400]   And this is where bad theology comes from.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:19.040]   When you begin to gain theology and you got this order mixed up.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.000]   The four things, and I mentioned this, and I'm going to mention this over and over and
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.480]   over again throughout the years.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.600]   Right understanding of the Bible first has to come from exegesis.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.000]   Exegesis of what we are going to be doing.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.580]   What we're trying to do in Bible study.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.200]   It has to come from careful analysis from verse by verse by verse.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.600]   If you understand your Christian life simply based upon topics.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.520]   A pastor is giving a topic about love, a topic about generosity, a topic about being good,
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.360]   a topic about unity.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.600]   What does the Bible teach about that?
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.080]   You would never know because you don't know if that's coming from that man's personal
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.640]   experience or if it's from God's word.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.200]   You can learn topically all your life and never really understand what God's word says.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.480]   You're going to be absolutely dependent upon what that person says.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.280]   It has to be from exegesis.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.760]   Whatever doctrinal statement you come from, "Well, where did you get it?"
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.720]   "Well, I happened to grow up in a Baptist church."
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.000]   That's not a good reason to be a Baptist.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.120]   Or "I had this pastor that I really liked."
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.000]   What if that guy commits adultery?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.920]   Your whole doctrinal position falls apart because you like that guy and then now you
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.000]   can't trust him.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.040]   So your convictions has to come from what you see in Scripture.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.080]   You see in Scripture, not what I see in Scripture, not what we collectively see, what do you
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.240]   see?
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.680]   So when Jesus asks you, "Who do you say I am?"
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.080]   You individually have that answer.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.760]   You can't be dependent upon the leaders to answer the questions for you.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:59.520]   If a Jehovah's Witness comes into this church and challenges you of the identity of Jesus
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.200]   Christ and you've been a Christian for more than two, three years and you can't refute
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.680]   his doctrine, you're still an infant.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.560]   It doesn't matter how many mission trips you've been to.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.040]   It doesn't matter how many small groups you've led.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.560]   You're still an infant because you're dependent on somebody else to protect you.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:22.040]   So all the more, as the day is drawing near, there's more and more bad doctrines, more
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.920]   and more bad teaching, more and more false prophets that are coming out.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.440]   And the reason why they're very effective is because they're very good at it.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:37.000]   So if you don't learn how to handle the Word of God accurately by yourself, there's going
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   to come a time when the leadership is going to disappoint you and your whole doctrinal
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.280]   disposition is going to be challenged because you don't respect the leaders.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:51.080]   Your spiritual life should not fall apart because we disappoint you.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.440]   So we need you to get into the Word of God on your own.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.080]   So it has to start with exegesis, and then from exegesis leads to systematic theology.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.520]   Give me an example of a systematic theology.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.160]   Some of you guys know what these terms are.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.400]   Some of you guys may be hearing this for the first time.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.840]   Exegesis, just to put it simply, is just careful study of God's Word from verse by verse,
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   what we are doing.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.360]   What is systematic theology?
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:25.040]   A collection of the things that you've studied that point us to something collectively about
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.040]   God.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.320]   So give me an example of systematic theology.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.400]   Trinity, right?
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:37.760]   The word Trinity does not exist in the Bible, but the doctrinal statement Trinity is a collection
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.640]   of study of the identity of Christ, God, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.420]   And when you put it all together, we have the doctrine of Trinity, right?
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.360]   Or God's sovereignty, right?
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.680]   Election, justification.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:57.400]   These are all doctrinal statements that comes from a careful study of all the collective
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.280]   passages we see in Scripture.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.360]   And then when we say, "What does the Bible say about salvation?"
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.480]   Then you can give systematic theology, right?
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.600]   So exegesis is from the text.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.680]   Systematic theology is the collection of it, right?
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.320]   What is historical theology then?
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.600]   What has been passed down to us from the church fathers, right?
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.000]   So the doctrines that we have didn't just pop out of the sky.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.920]   It was handed, the word of God was given to the early church and they wrestled with it.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.920]   So we have 2,000 years of Bible scholars who've been wrestling through the original language,
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.080]   refuting back and forth, fighting with false doctrines, and then have decided that this
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.640]   is not biblical, this is biblical.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.120]   This is orthodox, this is unorthodox.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.160]   So that's not where we get our final authority.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:56.560]   But it would be wise to make sure that whatever doctrinal statements that we come up with,
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.720]   that it doesn't contradict historical theology.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   Does that make any sense?
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.720]   No?
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.720]   Okay.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.280]   Does that make sense?
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.800]   So historical theology is part three where we're comparing.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.280]   So if somebody comes up and says, "You know, I believe this about God and it contradicts
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:22.960]   historical theology," he's probably wrong, right?
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.920]   A person did not all of a sudden 2,000 years later find something new that 2,000 years
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.800]   of study of God's Word did not find.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.680]   It doesn't mean it can't happen, but 99.999%, you're probably the one who's wrong, right?
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.600]   So that's where it's historical theology.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.840]   And then philosophical theology is how do we make sense of it?
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.320]   If God is sovereign and man is responsible, how does this work?
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.480]   And trying to understand how the Bible fits together is philosophical theology, where
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.060]   we're trying to philosophically make sense.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.480]   How does God's righteousness and His mercy exist together, right?
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.440]   Does that make sense?
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:08.360]   Now, the reason why this is so important, this is where bad theology comes in, and see
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.400]   if you can recognize this kind of logic, right?
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:18.320]   I don't know if homosexuality is wrong.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.940]   Why?
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.960]   Because I have gay friends and they're very moral people.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.800]   They're very kind and they're very upright people.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.760]   So I can't believe that God would condemn such nice, kind people, and some of them are
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.560]   more moral than a lot of the Christian friends we have.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.000]   So the Bible can't possibly be teaching that.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.480]   So they go back to the Scripture and they look at certain things.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.080]   See, God says to love, and then maybe that's not what God says, right?
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:52.640]   So they're taking a philosophical issue of how do we reconcile, right, a condemnation
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:58.400]   of a group of people that seems to be nice, and then God says salvation is found in Christ
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.400]   and Christ alone.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.120]   And again, if you reject the inerrancy in the Word of God, you reject Christ.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.760]   So how do you reconcile these things?
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:10.600]   And so a lot of times bad theology comes from our own perception of what we think is right
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.460]   or wrong.
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.520]   And then we go back to Scripture and then make the Scripture fit our philosophical theology.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:26.280]   So bad theology typically comes from thinking, trying to think logically and then working
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.960]   back to Scripture.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.240]   Okay?
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:36.680]   Now this is extremely important because you're probably being tested now.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.960]   Maybe some of you are wrestling with it already because you've had conversations with your
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.160]   friends who've challenged you.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.840]   How can you be that bigoted if these nice, moral, upright, generous, kind people, how
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.760]   can they be condemned in the Word of God, right?
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.220]   So again, we have to make sure if we believe the Word of God is the Word of God, our right
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.640]   and wrong has to first come from the Word of God, not your sense of right and wrong,
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.440]   but God's sense of right and wrong.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.560]   And that's why it has to start from exegesis, right?
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:12.360]   You may reject the Word of God, but you cannot change the Word of God.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.920]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.360]   I can tell you that this wall is beige, and you can say that you don't like beige, but
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.560]   you can't say it's not beige.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.560]   Is it beige?
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.560]   Is it yellow?
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.560]   Okay?
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.820]   You understand my point, right?
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.960]   You understand my point?
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:34.360]   The problem is they see Scripture, they don't like what it says, and then they say that's
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.360]   not what it says.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.720]   You can't do that, right?
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.640]   You can reject what it says and say, "I don't believe that.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.920]   I don't think that's fair.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.320]   I don't believe that this is God's Word."
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.600]   You can say that.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.700]   That's your prerogative whether you believe it or don't believe it, but you can't go back
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:53.240]   to Scripture and say that Bible does not say that because you don't like it, right?
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:58.440]   So exegesis is a careful study of God's Word to find out what it says.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:03.380]   If you choose to believe it, not believe it, that's another issue, right?
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.540]   But we don't change what it says because you like it or don't like it.
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:12.060]   So the study of exegesis, our doctrinal statements all come from exegesis, which leads to systematic
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:19.380]   theology, which leads to historical theology, right, which kind of connects us to historical
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.200]   theology, then we can have conversations about in our application time, what does this mean
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.360]   in the life of a Christian, right?
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.320]   How do we share this with non-Christians?
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.440]   How do we reconcile this, right?
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   Hopefully that makes sense.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.020]   I'm going to say this over and over again.
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.880]   As long as you're at church, I'm going to make sure that this is pounded in because
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.340]   that's how bad doctrine comes in, right?
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.400]   I know people that I've studied the Word of God with years, and then all of a sudden,
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.200]   I don't see them for years, and they come back, and they say, again, their logic, their
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.040]   theology has gone way astray, and I asked them how that happened, and it always starts
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:00.560]   with, you know, how can God be fair if He does this, and they work backwards to Scripture,
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.640]   right, instead of arguing from Scripture, okay?
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.000]   So we want to make sure that you know what the Word of God says.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.560]   Observation, interpretation, application, okay, and this is basically what we're going
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.000]   to be working through, and this is probably where we're going to be doing most of our
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.680]   work is the observation, is getting you in the habit of asking and observing and interpreting,
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.720]   right?
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.180]   So that's the part I'm going to ask you to do, right?
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.840]   So if you've never done this before, you say, "I don't know if I can do this.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.960]   You know, I've never even read the Bible through one time.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.960]   Like, how am I going to do this?"
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:40.680]   We're going to break it down so that everybody, at least at the end of Colossians, you know
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.760]   what kind of questions to ask and how to interpret the passage, okay?
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:49.240]   So observance stage, we observe the passage, it says, "Answers who, what, where, why,
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.240]   when, how of the text."
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.240]   Pretty easy.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.240]   Who?
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.240]   Paul.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.800]   Who did he write it to?
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.720]   Colossians, right?
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.840]   And then if you read a couple of times, you should already know why he wrote it.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.020]   What is the theme, right?
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.020]   Where is Colossians?
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.080]   If you look it up, Google it, it's easy, right?
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.040]   Years ago, I had to go to the library and find out an atlas and then find where it was
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.880]   and it took me an hour to find out.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.320]   Now you just have to say, "Colossians," and it just pops up in an image, right?
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.320]   So it's easy.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.480]   So we're going to talk a lot about that part of it.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.240]   Second part of it, interpretation.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.880]   Once we've made all the observations, what does it mean?
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.120]   You can't go to what does it mean before you made any observations.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.880]   You understand what I'm saying, right?
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:39.040]   It's kind of like trying to figure out what somebody said without listening to everything
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.040]   that they have to say.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.380]   You're just kind of jumping in the middle and then it's like, "Oh, that's what you meant."
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.960]   So observation part is making sure we're doing our homework before we say, "This is what
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.360]   it says," right?
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.080]   And then the application part.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.600]   If it does not lead to application, that's not Christian study.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.180]   The purpose of Christian study is never to simply know, right?
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.640]   It's to know so that we can do.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.400]   It's to obey.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:12.920]   So we're not studying scripture like we're at a museum just enjoying fine art.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.880]   We just happen to like theology.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.240]   If it doesn't lead to obedience, it leads to arrogance.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.720]   And it always leads to one or the other.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.040]   It fills you with pride, thinking, "I know better," and look at all those other people
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.640]   don't know what I know, and it actually ruins you, right?
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.560]   But the purpose of Christian Bible study is always to lead to application.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.160]   And so at the end of every Bible study, we're going to give you time for application like
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.600]   we've been doing through Leviticus, okay?
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.880]   Keys to good observation, ask as many questions as possible.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.160]   Become a child.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.760]   Even silly questions, even questions that you think are dumb, right?
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.760]   Just ask the question.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.800]   If you're curious, ask the question, right?
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.720]   I've always found the people who are the most curious are the best Bible students.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.840]   People who ask the most, "Why is this?
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.840]   Why is that?
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.840]   How come this is?
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.280]   How come that is?"
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.160]   And it may sound annoying, but those are the people who learn and grow.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:16.160]   But people who just kind of accept whatever it is, they're always at the exact same place.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.120]   They never mature and they never really grow, right?
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.440]   So the first part of Bible study is asking as many questions as possible.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.320]   So we're going to give you an opportunity to do that.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:32.360]   And we're going to have you constantly practice asking questions, thinking critically, right?
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.880]   And I know some of you guys don't like to think critically because, you know, you just
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.480]   kind of like, "Well, just tell me what to do.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.320]   I've heard that so many times."
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.240]   You know, like, "Just what is it you want me to do?"
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.120]   The point of it is not to get you to simply jump from point A to point B. You need to
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.120]   know why.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.360]   If you don't know why, what later on isn't going to be enough.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.680]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.960]   If you don't understand why God wants you to do something, eventually you're going to
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.600]   lose motivation and you're going to become a Pharisee.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.120]   You're just jumping through hoops without knowing why.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.760]   Look for who, what, why, where, and how.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.760]   Take some small chunks at a time.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.000]   I'm not going to ask you here.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.880]   You're going to have some time to do Bible study in your small groups.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:24.520]   My guess is a lot of you, a Bible study is reading one chapter a day.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.680]   Or you read through the Bible three chapters, like if you're diligent.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:34.520]   There's a huge difference between understanding the Bible from big chunks at a time, right?
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:42.080]   Let me tell you the difference, and I think it's a very good analogy.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.360]   There's about 140, 150 people in this room.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:52.600]   Now if you've been at a church for a while, my guess is you'll probably know about 50%,
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.360]   50 to 60% maybe.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.600]   Maybe if you're good, maybe about 80, 90%.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.400]   You'll know the people in this room.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.680]   But how well do you know them?
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.380]   Some of them you're very close with, and some of them you're acquaintances with.
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.880]   Some of them you've just seen their face.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.480]   You know that they go to this church, but you don't really know them.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.760]   So from a distance in a large group, you know them, but you don't really know them.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.960]   The people that you are intimate with are either they were your roommates, you grew
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.360]   up together, you went to missions, you spent intimate time with them very personally.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.520]   And that's how you got to know them.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.480]   You were in a small group, or you did one-to-one, or whatever it may be, right?
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.480]   Bible study is the same.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.760]   If all you know about the Scripture is in a large context, and you're just kind of serving,
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.040]   I'm not saying serving the Bible, you'll know major themes topically.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.040]   God is good.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.440]   God died for us.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.480]   Everything God wants us to be holy.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.700]   You know these major themes, but you don't know the details intimately.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.800]   And so that's why it's important for us that when we study the Bible, that you don't just
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.400]   understand the large themes in the Bible, but the details and how those things came
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.400]   together.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.400]   And that's why inductive Bible study is so important.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.680]   I know some of you guys memorizing through the Book of James.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.040]   I'll bet you some of you guys have done quiet time, many times through the Book of James,
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:18.960]   but memorizing it all of a sudden, you notice things that you probably never noticed before.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.160]   And you probably looked at that passage and heard sermons about that so many times, but
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.800]   all of a sudden, there are certain words in there, there are certain phrases that you
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:30.400]   see repeated and connected that you probably didn't notice before, if you're memorizing
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.260]   Book of James.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.480]   Because you're looking at it much more intimately than you did before.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:40.440]   And the book will begin to come alive when you are that intimate with that book.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:46.000]   And so inductive Bible study is kind of like that, is to get us to go deeper.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.860]   And this is why, again, I say, if you're coming to be spoon-fed, you're going to be disappointed
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.000]   because I'm not going to spoon-feed you.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.360]   I'm going to teach you how to eat.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.440]   The goal of the inductive Bible study is not quantity, but quality, as I've been mentioning.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.960]   Look for the following as you read, background and context.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:13.120]   And that's the part that I want you to hold on to this sheet as we're doing the study.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.120]   What is the background?
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.120]   What is the context?
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.120]   Constantly looking.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.760]   Who are the key people that are involved?
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.640]   Who are the two key people that are mentioned right off the bat?
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.560]   Paul and Timothy, right?
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.960]   He mentions a bunch of people's names at the end of chapter four, and we'll go and take
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.520]   a look at that later.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.480]   But who are the key people?
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.720]   What are words that are emphasized?
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:42.080]   Like, "Indeed," "verily," "truly," like Jesus says a lot of these things.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.320]   When these things, when you see these things, it means to slow down and take a look.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.280]   When certain things are repeated, right?
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.840]   Like, six things God hates, seven things God detests.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.720]   He's not stuttering.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.360]   It's meant for us to slow down.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.160]   "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord," right?
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.880]   Again, He's not stuttering.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:09.160]   It was meant for us to slow down and take this part of it a lot more carefully and with
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.240]   much more weightiness.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.760]   So when you see certain things or phrases, even in the epistles that are repeated, it
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.460]   may not be repeated right, like, back to back.
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.760]   Sometimes it may be repeated within the span of maybe five, six verses.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:27.240]   You'll see the same words being repeated like 10 times, right?
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.720]   If you remember when we were studying through the book of Romans, by the time we get to
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:39.460]   Romans chapter six, the word "law" is repeated over 20-some times over there.
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:44.920]   So you know just by circling "law," like, that's what Paul is talking about.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:50.000]   This whole chapter is about how the law fits into the gospel, right?
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.800]   You'll see that as we're studying.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.360]   I'm going to have you guys ask, "What are some words that are repeated?"
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:00.000]   And then when you see that for yourself, you'll see, "Ah, this is Paul's main point," right?
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.680]   And all the other points are kind of to bolster up this point.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.120]   And so look for repeated words, okay?
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.540]   Tenses.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.540]   Is it in the past tense?
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.540]   Is it in the present tense?
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.320]   Is it in the future tense?
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:18.880]   When he says, "The gospel is foolishness to those who are being saved," right?
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.640]   No, sorry, God.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:27.120]   It's to those who are perishing, and it is the power of God for those who are being saved.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.420]   You notice the tense there that he uses the present tense, right?
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.840]   So is that significant?
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.040]   Extremely significant.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.600]   He describes our salvation as an ongoing process.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.240]   So that's huge in how we understand justification and sanctification.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:49.380]   So asking what tense is being used will highlight certain major doctrinal things that you may
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.440]   have missed in the past.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.300]   So what tenses are being used?
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:58.160]   Is it a statement or a command, right?
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:03.060]   Is it simply saying that this is who God is, or is it saying you need to do this?
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:07.520]   Is it an imperative, or is it an indicative, right?
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:14.480]   How you read that passage and how that passage is applied will differ tremendously based upon
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.700]   if it is a command or is it a statement, right?
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.960]   What genre is it in?
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   Is it poetic?
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:26.020]   You know, a lot of people get into trouble when they study the book of Proverbs, and
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.680]   then because they take it as a command, right?
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.320]   It's a wisdom literature, and wisdom literature is giving wise sayings.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.800]   It doesn't mean that God's going to do this, right?
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.960]   That if you raise up a child in the Lord that He will not stray, that meaning that if you
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.280]   did quiet time and did family worship that He will never stray from God.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.280]   Is that a promise?
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.840]   No, it's wisdom.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.840]   It's life lesson.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.840]   It is not a command.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.080]   It is not an imperative saying if you do this, and then it says, "Well, God said He would
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.080]   not stray.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.400]   Why is my son straying?"
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.200]   Because it's a wisdom saying.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.920]   It is not an imperative, right?
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.040]   So what genre is it in?
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.360]   Is it descriptive or prescriptive?
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.340]   And this is huge, right?
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:12.600]   The difference between a descriptive and prescriptive is descriptive is just telling you what happened,
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.880]   right?
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.840]   So here's a, again, common mistake that people make.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.400]   They read the book of Acts.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.600]   They got together, they prayed, and the Holy Spirit fell upon them.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.280]   They began to speak in tongues.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.400]   And so therefore, every time we pray, we should be speaking in tongues.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.760]   Is that what Acts chapter 2 teaches us?
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.760]   No, it's descriptive.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.540]   It's telling us what happened.
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.780]   It's not telling us what to do, right?
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.560]   That's the difference between a narrative, something that God is recording, something
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.760]   that has happened, versus telling us this is what you ought to do, right?
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.240]   So descriptive is, is it describing something?
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.360]   Prescriptive, is it telling us something?
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:58.000]   You have to make the distinction between the two, okay?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.040]   Bad application, a lot of times comes from that.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.920]   Purpose of words such as "for," "so that," "in order that," "since," "because," "therefore,"
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.000]   these are all words that connect sentences to other parts.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.560]   So whenever you see the word "therefore," if you don't know the previous passage, you're
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.360]   not going to understand the next passage, right?
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.760]   One of the biggest "therefores" in the New Testament is Romans chapter 12, verse 1.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.320]   "Therefore, in view of God's mercy," 11 chapters.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.480]   So if you didn't study 11 chapters, you're not going to get the same impact that Paul
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.000]   intended in Romans chapter 1 and chapter 12, 1 and 2.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.840]   So watch out for these key words, because these words point to something else, okay?
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.840]   Again, you're not going to know all of this.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.560]   I'm going through this real quick, because I want you to -- these are things that you're
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:51.880]   going to be practicing as we are observing and asking questions, okay?
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.800]   Keys to accurate interpretation is thorough observation of the context, the historical
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.520]   context, okay?
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:07.960]   You may not know it, but all of our communication is almost always first from where we are,
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.960]   because that's what you hear, right?
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:20.560]   So if you said -- again, if you said "bomb," depending on what generation you grew up in,
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.380]   that word "bomb" is going to sound very different, right?
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:28.720]   If you happen to be, you know, during World War II, where the nuclear bomb was dropped,
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:33.120]   you'd be "da bomb," the nuclear bomb, right?
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:40.080]   Or if you happen to be a younger generation, "da bomb" meaning like something nice or great
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.440]   or cool or something, right?
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:48.080]   It meant something different, so everybody hears it based upon your cultural context.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.520]   You have to make sure that when you're studying the Bible that you make an effort to hear
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.320]   from their context, right?
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:04.760]   When the Bible says, "Slave, obey your master," the natural culture -- our culture is going
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:10.560]   to hear that from the atrocities that were committed by slave traders in modern history.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.760]   So natural question that they ask is, "How can God allow this?"
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:21.040]   Because they're taking what they knew and then projecting it back into the Bible.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.840]   So when he talks about slavery, what was slavery like in the New Testament?
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:31.600]   Was it an evil institution where people were forced into slavery like the modern history?
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.840]   Again, I'm not going to answer that for you.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.280]   That's the thing that I'm asking you to do.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.920]   You have to go back and understand it from their cultural context.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.640]   Understand?
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.720]   Okay?
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.240]   So that you don't project and say, "They did this, and how come they're doing that?"
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.400]   From our cultural context.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.640]   So first is historical context.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.920]   Our cultural context, right?
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:03.720]   Every time, if you've ever gone through cross-cultural evangelism, you know that you have to understand
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.320]   how to share the gospel in that context.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:14.480]   Like Pastor Alex said many times that in China, when they talk about sin, they hear criminal.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.760]   And so you kind of have to explain to them what sin is because automatically they say
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.760]   criminals.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.760]   "I'm not a criminal."
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.760]   That sounds very different.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.760]   It's like, "Are you a sinner?"
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.760]   Like, "Are you a criminal?"
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.840]   So if I ask you, "Are you a criminal?"
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.840]   Most people will say, "No."
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.800]   "Are you a sinner?"
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.240]   Most people will say, "Yes."
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.000]   And so you have to understand the context.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.560]   So the cultural context in which that was written, are we interpreting it based upon
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.280]   how they understood it?
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:48.880]   And then in the context of the rest of the scripture, nothing written in the New Testament
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.860]   is independent of other passages.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:32:02.480]   You have to look at all 66 of the Bible, the letters, as one author and one theme.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.560]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.960]   It is about God's redemptive history of mankind.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.120]   It's about the preparation of coming Christ.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.920]   It's about Christ, and it's about Christ who has come and his second coming.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.600]   So all of scripture has to be connected to that.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.900]   So if your interpretation has nothing to do with Christ, you probably are not getting
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.080]   the main point.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.220]   It doesn't mean that every single word, every single passage has to mean Christ.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:32.480]   But if the collective understanding of your interpretation doesn't add to an understanding
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:39.240]   of redemptive history in Christ, you probably missed the point.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.200]   And then obviously the context of the immediate letter.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:50.640]   So you never take a word or a verse without understanding the chapter and the book, because
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.920]   that's where bad theology comes in.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:57.080]   People jump into Colossians chapter 3 and then say, "This is my verse for this year."
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.520]   And then say, "Well, what comes before?
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.520]   What comes after?
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.520]   Why did he write that?
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.520]   What did he mean by that?"
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.520]   You don't know any of that.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.320]   You're just projecting what you think that word means, right?
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.680]   You would never read any letter, any book.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.900]   You would never walk in the middle of a movie and watch a movie that way.
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.720]   But for whatever the reason, when we study the Bible, people are in the habit of jumping
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.440]   right in the middle and then claiming certain things without knowing the context.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.440]   So context, context, context, context.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:33.400]   All right, so I'm going to hurry through this because I'm going to go through this real
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:38.640]   quick and I'm going to talk about it more later.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.720]   Sixth question, "Is there an example for me to follow?
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.600]   Is there a sin to avoid, promise to claim, prayer to repeat, command to obey, verse to
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.640]   memorize, and then is it practical?
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.640]   Is it personal?"
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:52.800]   This is an aspect that, again, every week after we do our analysis, we're going to ask
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:57.360]   you guys to make an effort to, like, what does this mean?
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.560]   Before you ask the question, "What does it mean to me?"
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.680]   You have to ask the question, "What does it mean first?"
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:09.000]   So all of the hermeneutic stuff that we talked about, after you've done that, you ask, "What
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.080]   does it mean for me?"
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.080]   We don't start with this.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.080]   We end with this.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:20.200]   All right, that part, we'll get to it later.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:25.480]   All right, so this is the part where I'm going to have you guys come and help.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.280]   So take out the four chapters.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:32.280]   Again, like I said, today is going to be a bit different than the other weeks.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   Okay.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:42.560]   All right, so the first thing I want to do is take out your sheet and I want to go over,
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:48.680]   before we jump into the actual verses, we want to get an overview, understanding of
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.960]   what it says.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:57.080]   And so I'm going to work through the first chapter with you, and then I'm going to ask
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.560]   you guys to do chapter two.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.560]   And then we're going to see, I'm going to have you guys do the study.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:09.640]   So again, I know some of you guys may not have done this in the past.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.720]   Maybe you just came in here and said, "Yeah, I don't want to study."
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.720]   Wrong Bible study.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.640]   All right, I'm going to have no mercy.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.560]   This is because I'm going to get you to study.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.600]   So take out the things.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:26.680]   So what I want you to do is we're going to try to outline, and I don't think we're going
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.880]   to go through all four chapters, but we're going to try to outline this first chapter
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.880]   first.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:37.120]   So as you're reading it, what I want you to do is, again, read on your own.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.120]   Don't look at me.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.120]   Read your...
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.120]   That's why I got the printout.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.160]   If you don't have a pen, go get a pen.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.160]   Okay?
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.720]   And I'll give you an example.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.920]   So when we read together, "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy,
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:57.000]   our brother, to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae, grace to you
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.440]   and peace from God our Father."
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:07.520]   So what I want you to do is when you look at the first two verses, that's the introduction.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.400]   Right?
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.740]   And I'm going to do that one for you.
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.320]   So you bracket that together and say, "That's the introduction."
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:19.840]   So where is the next bracket should be?
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:43.760]   Read that on your own and find the next paragraph.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.760]   Don't go too far.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:57.000]   Just find the next one.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.640]   Don't cheat.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.720]   It doesn't help you to just copy someone's paper.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:19.960]   I want you to know what's in Colossians.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.120]   So where do you think the next outline is?
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.960]   Okay, 3 to 8.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.960]   That's what I have too.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.960]   What would you title that?
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.560]   Hmm?
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.680]   Okay, Thanksgiving.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.680]   Keep going.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:38:07.880]   If you have an opinion as to where the next outline should be, I'll give you a chance
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.880]   to see.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:14.880]   Raise your hand and let me see.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.880]   Okay.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:30.440]   Okay, 9 through 12.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:37.480]   And what would you title that?
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:42.160]   Okay.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:47.320]   So far I have the same thing.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:53.320]   Keep looking.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:59.320]   Okay.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.320]   Okay.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.320]   Okay.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:11.320]   Okay.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.320]   Okay.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:19.320]   Okay.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.320]   Okay.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:29.320]   Okay.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:35.320]   Okay.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   Where's the next section?
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:09.320]   Okay.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.320]   13 to 18.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.320]   Anybody have anything different?
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   Okay, 13 to 20.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   Is that what you have?
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.320]   Okay.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   Which one are you going to go with?
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.320]   All right, 13 to 20.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.320]   All right.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.320]   Okay, and how did you name that?
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.320]   What?
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.320]   You can't read my writing?
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.320]   Or I just put --
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:41:00.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:29.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.320]   Okay, so I'm going to put --
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.320]   Okay, salvation.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:42:01.320]   Okay, I'll just put salvation there.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:09.320]   And then the last section,
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.320]   what would you title that?
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.320]   Okay.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   Okay.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.320]   Just look up here for a second, okay?
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.320]   So this is what I want you to do
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.320]   through the book of Colossians as homework.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.320]   Okay?
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:50.320]   I'm not going to have you --
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.320]   For the sake of time,
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.320]   I'm not going to have you guys do this now.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.320]   But before we jump into
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.320]   what Paul is saying in verse 2 and 3 and 4,
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.320]   you need to know where he's going with this.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.320]   Right?
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.320]   Instead of me just telling you,
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.320]   "Hey, this is what Paul is saying,"
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.320]   if you see it for yourself where Paul is saying --
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.320]   What is his argument?
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.320]   What is verse 3, 4, 5, 6, 7?
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.320]   What does that argument ultimately lead to?
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   What is his thesis?
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.320]   If you don't understand his thesis
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:20.320]   and you're just trying to dissect, right?
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.320]   If somebody gave a speech
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.320]   and you're just jumping in
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.320]   and you're just hearing the first few words
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.320]   that he said in the beginning of the speech
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.320]   and trying to analyze what he meant by those words,
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:34.320]   you're not really going to get the full impact.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.320]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.320]   You have to know what the speech was about
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.320]   so that you can go back and look at the sentences
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.320]   that he used to bolster up his main point.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.320]   Right?
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:49.320]   So, it's not enough for me to tell you
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.320]   that this is what Colossians is about.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.320]   It's different when you see it for yourself.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.320]   "Oh, this is what Paul is saying."
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:59.320]   So that when we jump into verses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6,
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.320]   that you know how this is connected
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.320]   to the rest of the book.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.320]   Right?
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.320]   Okay?
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.320]   So, some of you guys are already kind of like,
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.320]   "Oh my gosh, I don't know if this is what I want to do."
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.320]   Right?
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.320]   This is what we're doing.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.320]   Okay?
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.320]   So you have to come in.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.320]   You have to dive into the Word of God.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:21.320]   You can't be a Berean because you became a member.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.320]   You're not a Berean because you became a member.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.320]   Because we're trying to teach the Bible from the pulpit.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.320]   You have to know what the Word of God says yourself.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.320]   Right?
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.320]   And so, that's one part of it.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.320]   And I'm going to ask you guys to study it in that way.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.320]   And let me just tell you,
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.320]   I was a Bible major undergrad,
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.320]   and then I went to seminary afterwards,
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.320]   and then I started preaching topically
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.320]   probably for the first five or six years of my ministry.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.320]   I knew verses.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.320]   I memorized two verses every single week
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.320]   for the first six, seven, eight years of my life.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.320]   I mean, my Christian life,
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.320]   because that was what my Bible study leaders told me to do.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.320]   My theology completely flipped
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:12.320]   when I began to teach the Bible from book to book to book.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.320]   And I didn't do that because I was convicted.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.320]   I did that because I was running out of topics.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.320]   Yeah, because how many times am I going to preach on lordship?
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.320]   How many times am I going to preach on finance and about being holy?
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.320]   And I can give all these topics, and I knew that well.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.320]   Like, I probably had about 20 sermons that I could have just--
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:34.320]   if somebody said, "Hey, go and give a, you know, like, seven sermons on this topic,"
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.320]   I could have just kind of did it,
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.320]   because I did six, seven years if that's all I was doing.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.320]   And then I started preaching through John.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.320]   That was the first book I started to preach through.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.320]   And then I started preaching through Philippians.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.320]   And then from Philippians, I remember jumping to Thessalonians,
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.320]   and first and second Thessalonians, and went to James.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.320]   So I remember very chronologically.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:58.320]   By the time I got to about a third to a half of the New Testament,
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:03.320]   my paradigm of how I understood God completely changed.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:07.320]   And I realized that so much of what I thought the Bible said,
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   that's not what the Bible said at all.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.320]   And I--it just completely transformed.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:15.320]   And so that's what kind of scared me,
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.320]   because I could live my whole Christian life hearing topical sermons
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.320]   and memorizing verses here and there,
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.320]   thinking that you understood what the Bible says, right,
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.320]   without really knowing what it says.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.320]   And that's why this is so important that
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:36.320]   just because you've heard expositional preaching for ten years
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.320]   doesn't mean you know the Bible, right?
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:44.320]   You know what I know, but you don't know the Bible, right?
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.320]   You have to study the Bible on your own.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.320]   You have to study the Bible.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.320]   I can't emphasize this enough.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:54.320]   Being a member at a Bible-teaching church doesn't make you a Berean.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:47:00.320]   You're not any more protected from bad doctrine that's coming in
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.320]   if you don't know how to handle the Word of God yourself.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:06.320]   So if you're in a regular habit of not coming to the Word
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.320]   and you're enjoying the fellowship of the church, right,
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   I guarantee you there's going to come a time
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:17.320]   when your friendship is not going to be enough.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:21.320]   Then you're going to realize that you had no faith at all, right,
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:25.320]   because you're being propped up by external things in the church,
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.320]   but it's not about your personal walk with God.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.320]   So again, I can't emphasize this enough.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.320]   If you are not in the habit of studying the Word of God,
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.320]   this is a good time to start.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.320]   All right, so the next part, before I break you up into small group,
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:45.320]   is I want--again, your first homework is to go through that,
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.320]   all four chapters, and get a good outline.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:52.320]   The outline that we have here is the first five weeks of the Bible study.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.320]   So today we're going to be looking at verse 1 and 2 together
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.320]   just to kind of give you a guideline as to how to do observation.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:03.320]   And then next week, the homework is from verse 3 to 8.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:08.320]   And I'm going to give you, again, assignments to what to do before you leave.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:13.320]   All right, so let's look at verse 1 and 2 in observation.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.320]   Okay.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:23.320]   So what does the Bible say?
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:29.320]   All right, so we're not going to be able to practice all of it,
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.320]   but the point of this exercise is to ask as many questions.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.320]   It's not to get the answer, so don't raise hands and say,
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:39.320]   "The apostle means this." Like, I don't want answers.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.320]   Right? I just want questions.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.320]   And ask as many questions as possible.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:48.320]   So I'm going to give you just two, three minutes on your own.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.320]   Just look at those two verses, and I want you to jot down
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:56.320]   as many questions that comes out from those two verses,
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.320]   even if it sounds silly.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   Okay?
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   [silence]
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.320]   [silence]
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.320]   [silence]
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:13.320]   [silence]
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:16.320]   [silence]
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:20.320]   [silence]
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.320]   [silence]
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:45.360]   Professor Scott Goudsmith - Once upon a time.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:53.360]   [Silence]
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:50:03.360]   [Silence]
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:13.360]   [Silence]
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:23.360]   [Silence]
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:33.360]   [Silence]
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:43.360]   [Silence]
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:48.360]   So on that piece of paper, write down as many questions as you can.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:53.360]   And the more you do this, the better your questions will become.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:51:14.360]   [Silence]
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:24.360]   Again, this exercise is not to find the answer, just the questions.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:34.360]   [Silence]
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:44.360]   [Silence]
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   [Silence]
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:52:04.360]   [Silence]
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:14.360]   [Silence]
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:24.360]   [Silence]
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:34.360]   [Silence]
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:44.360]   [Silence]
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:49.360]   Okay, for the sake of time, if you guys can look up for a minute.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:57.360]   So again, this part of it is not for us to find the answers.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.360]   Any questions, the more questions the better.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.360]   What are some questions that you have?
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:09.360]   It's probably better if you share with your small group first.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:13.360]   I don't expect good participation in this large group.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.360]   So in your small group, share the questions that you have with each other.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.360]   Okay?
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:41.360]   [Silence]
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:45.360]   I made 150 copies.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:49.360]   We have over 175.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:54.360]   I know, but on paper we're going to add 120.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.360]   So there's 15 more people.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.360]   See if I took more.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:05.360]   I made 145 copies.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:21.360]   [Silence]
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.360]   I wasn't planning to.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:29.360]   I want them to study.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.360]   Okay, next week.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.360]   Okay, next week.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:47.360]   [Silence]
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:50.360]   Don't let anybody answer.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.360]   Okay?
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.360]   Don't let anybody answer.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:54.360]   This is just asking.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:55:23.360]   [Silence]
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:34.360]   [Laughter]
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:48.360]   [Laughter]
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:56:06.360]   [Laughter]
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:26.360]   [Laughter]
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:48.360]   [Laughter]
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.360]   All right.
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.360]   For the sake of time, if you guys can take a look.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.360]   Okay?
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:57:01.360]   If you look at what I did, I put the verses and I divided it into, you know, those key
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:06.360]   words when I told you about and, by, and, that kind of gives you an idea of the thought
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:07.360]   flow.
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:11.360]   So whenever I do Bible study, I divide the Bible verses like this first.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:17.360]   The reason why I do this is because visually I see the outline, even in a sentence, and
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:22.360]   it helps me to see, like, oh, Paul, who's he talking to, right, in his identities, and
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:26.360]   an apostle, okay, by the will of God, and Timothy, our brother.
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:30.360]   So just looking at it visually, instead of seeing it in just one line, seeing it this
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.360]   way helps me to see, okay, oh, that's where his thoughts are.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.360]   And then to the saints and faithful brethren.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.360]   So it kind of helps me to dig in a little bit more detail.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:39.360]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:42.360]   I'm not saying you have to do this, but this helps me.
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:47.360]   So every Bible study, every sermon I give, whatever text I'm studying, this is what
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.360]   I do to the text first.
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:53.360]   Okay, just to kind of get me to better understand the flow of his thought.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.360]   So what are some questions that came up?
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.360]   Just shout it out.
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.360]   Okay, who is Paul?
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:03.360]   Right?
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:06.360]   Where is Paul?
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:08.360]   Where is he writing this letter?
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.360]   Huh?
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:13.360]   Why are you laughing?
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:18.360]   Huh?
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.360]   Okay, who is Paul?
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.360]   Where is Paul?
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:21.360]   Good question.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:24.360]   Okay.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:26.360]   Where is Colossae?
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.360]   Okay.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.360]   Who is at Colossae?
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:36.360]   Who is he writing to?
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.360]   Okay, what prompted this letter?
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:43.360]   Okay, good.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.360]   What is an apostle?
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:50.360]   That's a very good question.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.360]   How many apostles are there?
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.360]   Are there 12?
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:54.360]   Are there 13?
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.360]   Was Barnabas an apostle?
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:59:04.360]   Anyway.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:07.360]   I heard a moaning, groaning.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:08.360]   I didn't hear anything.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:12.360]   Go ahead.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:17.360]   Okay, why is he distinguishing between saints and faithful brethren?
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:20.360]   Okay, good.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.360]   Who are the saints?
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.360]   Why are they called saints?
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.360]   Huh?
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:32.360]   What makes them saints?
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:36.360]   What is the will of God?
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:39.360]   Okay.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.360]   What specific things is he referring to when they say they were faithful?
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:48.360]   Okay.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.360]   Okay.
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:52.360]   What does Paul mean when he says in Christ?
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:58.360]   So these are all things that the more you study, the more you're going to have insight because it's like, oh, Paul used this before.
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.360]   When Paul says in Christ, he means this.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:05.360]   But when Peter says in Christ, he might mean something different.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.360]   Right?
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:11.360]   So the more you study it, the more you're going to be able to gain insight into these questions.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.360]   Right?
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.360]   Does Paul use the term apostle exclusively to himself?
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.360]   Does he use it to other apostles?
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.360]   Is this a generic term talking about a messenger?
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.360]   How is he using the word apostle?
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.360]   Is this a generic opening that he uses in every single letter?
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:32.360]   Or are the other letters that he opens up, does it sound different?
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.360]   Does he give them a different kind of title?
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:42.360]   And if he does, why does he give this kind of title in this letter and a different title in a different letter?
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:45.360]   What is the reason behind it?
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.360]   Which he does.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.360]   Again, the more you study, the more you ask questions, the more these things are going to make sense.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.360]   And the more deeper questions you're going to be able to ask.
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.360]   What else?
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:06.360]   Okay.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.360]   That's about four or five questions in one.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.360]   Okay.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.360]   Good.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.360]   What is grace and peace?
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.360]   Was that a common greeting for all Christians?
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.360]   Was that a unique Christian greeting?
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.360]   Did the Gentiles also use this greeting?
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:25.360]   Right?
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.360]   There's answers to all of these things.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.360]   Good questions.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:43.360]   Keep going.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.360]   What made them holy?
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:53.360]   How did they become holy?
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:02:00.360]   Okay. Good.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.360]   Why did he write to Colossae?
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.360]   What's the purpose of this letter?
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:12.360]   Okay.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.360]   Milk it. Just milk it.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.360]   It's okay.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.360]   Who's Timothy?
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.360]   Who?
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.360]   Oh, okay.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:32.360]   He already knows the answer.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:35.360]   Who's Timothy?
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.360]   Like how many other letters does Timothy come out?
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.360]   Right?
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.360]   And give you insight.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.360]   And obviously he writes letters to Timothy, but where else is Timothy mentioned?
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.360]   How intimate is Paul's relationship with Timothy?
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:54.360]   What relationship does he have with him?
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.360]   Did Paul ever visit this church?
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:00.360]   It's not here.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.360]   Yeah, you'll find out.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:07.360]   But that's a good question to ask.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.360]   Does he already have a relationship with them?
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.360]   Those are questions that will help out.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.360]   Right?
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:25.360]   Here are a couple more before we move on.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:28.360]   Okay. Good.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.360]   Why does he emphasize God's will?
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:38.360]   Now, does Paul open up any letter, other letter with the same title?
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.360]   He does.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.360]   And he mentions the will of God.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.360]   But it is not the common way he uses it.
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.360]   Why does he use it here and in those letters?
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.360]   There's about two or three different ways Paul opens up letters.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.360]   And if you study it, you'll find it is directly linked to why he's writing the letter,
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.360]   who he's writing the letter to.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.360]   So all of these things are relevant.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:06.360]   So even in this just short introduction, then typically you will read and just kind of skim through,
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.360]   "Oh, Paul's saying hi to the Colossians," and you just move forward.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:14.360]   But even in the way that he introduces himself kind of points to what he's going to say.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.360]   It points to his relationship.
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.360]   It points to why he says it.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.360]   Why in some letters does he say, "A bondservant of Jesus Christ,"
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.360]   and why in some letters he says, "I'm an apostle of Jesus Christ."
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.360]   Right?
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:30.360]   Where one speaks, he speaks with authority, and the other one he kind of places him as a servant.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.360]   Why does he do that?
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.360]   Like what is the purpose of that?
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.360]   What is the tone?
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.360]   How does that set the tone for the rest of the letter?
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.360]   So if you're writing a letter and you say, "Bondservant of Jesus Christ,"
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:46.360]   or "A prisoner of the Lord Jesus Christ," how does that set the tone for the rest of the letter?
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.360]   Right?
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:52.360]   He's a humble servant kind of coming to serve you, and then when he says, "Apostle of Jesus Christ,"
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:57.360]   you can kind of guess why he's setting his authority as an apostle.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.360]   Why would you think?
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.360]   Probably going to deal with some problems.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.360]   Right?
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:10.360]   He's going to be dealing with identity of Christ, Christology.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.360]   So he's speaking with some authority.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:16.360]   He's not just a bondservant coming and, you know, "What can I do?
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.360]   How can I wash your feet?"
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.360]   He said, "Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God."
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:21.360]   Not my will, but God's will.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.360]   So what I'm about to say to you, pay attention.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:29.360]   Does it come with that tone, or did I just milk that?
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:33.360]   So again, as you're studying the Scriptures, you're going to see that even in the way that
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:39.360]   he opens up the letter, it kind of sets the tone as to, "I'm an apostle talking, pay attention,"
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.360]   versus, "Prisoner of the Lord Jesus Christ," right?
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:49.360]   Like, "As humble servant suffering for the sake of the gospel, you know, I'm pleading with you."
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.360]   The tone is very different.
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.360]   Right?
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.360]   So if you've studied the Book of Colossians or you've known anything about the Book of Colossians,
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:02.360]   you know that this is a book heavy with Christology, and he's dealing with very, like,
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:05.360]   serious problems that are happening in the early church.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.360]   And he never visited this church before, but he's been hearing.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:15.360]   He's been hearing about how great this church is, but also there's two specific things that he's dealing with.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:19.360]   He's dealing with the Judaizers who are saying you have to become a Jew to be a Christian,
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:24.360]   which was a problem in many other churches, and he was also dealing with the Gnostics.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:29.360]   So you know how each of the Colossians deals with the Judaizers, the first John deals with the Gnostics,
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:32.360]   this book deals with both.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.360]   Right?
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:38.360]   So if you look at the way he opens up letters, you'll see that Paul typically,
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:42.360]   when he has something serious to say, he'll mention his apostleship,
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:45.360]   and then on top of that he says, "By the will of God."
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.360]   This is not me.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.360]   What I'm about to tell you isn't something that I've made up or these are not my thoughts.
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.360]   This comes from God's authority.
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.360]   God appointed me to tell you this.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.360]   Okay?
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:59.360]   So even in this introduction, if you don't ask questions and you don't dig,
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.360]   you're not going to gain that kind of insight.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.360]   So get in the habit of asking, and you'll see.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:13.360]   For me, the greatest proof of the inerrancy of the Word of God is the Bible itself,
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:19.360]   because there's so much in it that if you study it superficially and if you study it simply through commentaries,
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:25.360]   you'll say the right things without ever being affected by it because that's someone else's study.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.360]   Right?
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.360]   But if you get in the Word of God and you begin to ask questions,
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.360]   you begin to unearth things that maybe you didn't understand before,
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:37.360]   all of a sudden, not just once, but you're going to see how the Word of God is interconnected
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:43.360]   and the depth of God's Word, and there's no way that this was written by human hands.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.360]   Right?
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:49.360]   Like, how many times can you watch a movie, you know, and then come with different insights?
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.360]   Right?
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:54.360]   It's like, no matter how much you dig and dig and dig, after a while, you kind of like know everything
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:58.360]   because you're studying another human being.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.360]   But when you study the Word of God, there is no end.
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.360]   The more you dig, the more you realize how deep this is.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.360]   And then once you begin to realize how deep this is,
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:13.360]   you begin to see a supernatural authorship that this was not written by man.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.360]   And this is something that I can't just tell you.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.360]   I can't give this to you.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.360]   This is something that you have to come on your own and begin to dig.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.360]   Right?
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.360]   So, again, God is a holy God.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:27.360]   He didn't lay out there and say, "Anybody remember we talked about that?"
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:33.360]   He's not going to reveal Himself who's going to be superficially, "Okay, God, talk to me."
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.360]   "Oh, where are you?"
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.360]   "Oh, shh."
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.360]   He doesn't make any sense.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:43.360]   He doesn't reveal Himself to people who are nonchalantly approaching Him.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:48.360]   See, if you, what, "Seek me with all your heart," right?
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:52.360]   So He wants to be found.
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:54.360]   He wants to reveal Himself to you.
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:59.360]   But He's going to reveal Himself to people who are hungering and thirsting for Him.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.360]   Right?
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.360]   And so that's why I want you to get to the Word of God
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:10.360]   because the primary way that I know that this is God's Word is the Word itself.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:13.360]   And I'm not saying this because I'm a pastor.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.360]   If you want to meet with God, you have to get into the Word.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.360]   Your small group is not going to cut it.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:23.360]   Your mentor is not going to cut it.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.360]   The only thing that they can do is help you get to the Word of God.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.360]   But if you could meet with a mentor all your life and never get to the Word of God,
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:34.360]   you'll love your mentor, but you'll never love the Lord.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:38.360]   So, again, even in this short verse, there's so much.
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.360]   Even what we just talked about scratched the surface
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:43.360]   because we asked the questions here, but the more you dig,
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:47.360]   the more you're going to see how this is connected to the other parts of the Bible.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.360]   All right.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:53.360]   So if you can go to the--
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:59.360]   Can we switch back to the PowerPoint?
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.360]   All right.
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.360]   So today's Bible study is unique because this is an introduction to get you started.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.360]   So this is how the format of the Bible study is going to be.
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:13.360]   So, again, for homework, finish up outlining for the rest of Colossians,
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.360]   chapter 2, 3, 4, 5--no, 4,
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:22.360]   and then ask at least five important questions of Colossians 1 through 8,
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.360]   hopefully more than five.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.360]   We came up with about 10, 15 questions in two verses,
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:33.360]   so you should come up with five easily.
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.360]   So the discussion questions, verses 3, 4, and 5--
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.360]   I'm going to have you guys in your small group and take some time to discuss before you end.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.360]   But here's how the Bible study format is going to be.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.360]   When you come next week, have a seat.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:49.360]   We're going to start with worship.
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.360]   Then after the worship, you're going to go straight into your Bible study.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.360]   So verses 3 to 8, whatever discussions or insights that you have,
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.360]   you're going to go and take some time to share that.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:05.360]   While you are sharing that, I'm going to have the small group leaders text me.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:11.360]   While you are discussing, these are some questions that we have about this text.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:17.360]   And so what I'm going to do is a part of it is I'm going to answer some of the questions that you have,
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.360]   and then I'm going to try to give you some guidance on top of that.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.360]   Does that make sense?
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:27.360]   So instead of me telling you, "Look at this first, and look at this, and connect it to this,"
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.360]   I'm going to go off of your study, and I'm going to try to guide you through your study.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:36.360]   And while we're doing that, I'm going to try to teach you hermeneutical things that you should be looking for.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.360]   Instead of me telling you all the principles and then just kind of go at it,
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.360]   I'm going to be sharing that as we're going along.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.360]   So you're going to come and do the study, do the discussion,
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.360]   and I'm going to give you about 40, 45 minutes to do it first.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:55.360]   I'm going to come in about 30 minutes, and I'm going to do my portion of that through those studies,
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:58.360]   and after the 30 minutes, I'm going to get you back into your application part.
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.360]   Does that make sense?
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.360]   That's going to be the format from now on.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:06.360]   Now, are we going to sit in this format? I don't know.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.360]   Do you like this?
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:13.360]   Okay. Yes?
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.360]   Okay. We'll see.
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:20.360]   You know, you guys are like crammed, so when you guys go into deep things, it might be hard for you to listen to.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:26.360]   So we're thinking about just getting rid of all the chairs and spreading you guys out so that you won't be crammed next to each other.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:32.360]   If that doesn't work, we might try to figure something else out, because it might not be conducive to sharing.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:35.360]   It would be good for Bible study, but it would not be good for sharing,
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:38.360]   so we're just going to play it by ear, see what works best.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:44.360]   But at the minimum, next week, we're going to have everybody spread out further so that you won't be so crammed next to each other.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.360]   Okay?
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:50.360]   All right. So for today, if you can take some time to discuss this, and then before you end,
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:54.360]   I don't want you to take too much time, but before you end, I want you to look at verse 3 to 8 together
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:58.360]   and see if you can come up with about four or five questions, just to kind of get you guys going.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.360]   And then next week, to discuss that when you come.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.360]   Okay?
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:13.360]   Let me pray for us, and then I'll let you guys go to your small group.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:18.360]   Gracious Father, we thank you for your living word.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:24.360]   I pray, Father God, for myself, for my brothers and sisters in this room,
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:30.360]   that we would desire to know you more than the love of our friends,
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:37.360]   more than our desire to belong somewhere, and to connect, and to be a part of a church.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:40.360]   Lord, we desire to find our rest in you.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:48.360]   We want to hear your voice, Lord God, not mine, not older brothers and sisters.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.360]   We want to hear from you.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:58.360]   I pray that the study of Colossians will open our eyes, that we truly may hear your voice,
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:04.360]   that your children may hear his voice and follow him wherever he goes,
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:12.360]   to help us, Lord God, in our weakness, open our eyes, cause our ears to hear,
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.360]   that you would truly bless the time that we have.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.360]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.940]   (door closing)
