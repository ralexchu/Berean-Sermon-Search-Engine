[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.280]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12 verse 25 through 29.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.200]   Hebrews chapter 12 verse 25 through 29.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.960]   Reading out of the NASB, "See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.480]   For those who did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.600]   we escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.680]   And his voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised saying, 'Yet once more I
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.200]   will shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.'
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.800]   This expression, 'Yet once more,' denotes the removing of those things which can be
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.160]   shaken as of created things so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.040]   Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude by
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.920]   which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.920]   fire."
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.640]   Let's pray.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.600]   Heavenly Father, we pray for guidance.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.520]   We pray that power of your word would convict and guide us, renew us, strengthen us, Lord
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.080]   God, that we may live worthy lives of the gospel that you've given.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.480]   So we pray for your direction, your Holy Spirit to lead.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.480]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.480]   Amen.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:29.400]   Okay, we're going to continue on from what we started last week where we talked about
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.160]   what a proper response to the gospel of Jesus Christ is.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.280]   When we say, "Because of God's grace," if we have a wrong understanding of the gospel
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.400]   and the grace, we can easily think, "Because of grace, it doesn't matter what I do, that
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.840]   we have Christian liberty in Christ, so however I live, even though I ought to live this way,
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   but there isn't any consequence anymore because God has covered us with his blood."
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.040]   If we have a superficial understanding and possibly an understanding of cheap grace,
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.000]   we may easily apply it that way.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.080]   But as grace is grace, the Bible tells us that there is consequence if we refuse this
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.080]   grace.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.600]   And that's what he says in verse 25, chapter 12, we just read.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.920]   It says, "See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.920]   For if those who did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.100]   less will we escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven."
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.960]   If God said everything that he said to the old covenant people and they didn't respond
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.120]   in a way that they ought to have and there were serious consequences, how much more when
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.040]   it's not just a glimpse of him, it was not just a theophany, but God himself speaking
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.000]   from heaven that we just say, "Oh, okay, that's what he says, that's what he believes."
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.700]   And we just continue to go on living our life any way that we want.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.200]   That's exactly what he was trying to address in the book of Hebrew.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.080]   And that's why I think the book of Hebrew is so relevant to us today because he's not
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.120]   wrestling with any particular doctrine.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.280]   There wasn't anything that he was saying that this is the problem, that you guys are guilty
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.040]   of idolatry.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.440]   You guys are guilty of this and that.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.600]   He said, "Main problem with the audience of the Hebrews was they were just drifting.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.960]   They weren't passionately pursuing Christ anymore.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.800]   He wasn't supreme anymore.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.080]   They've lost their first love."
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.120]   And he said, "How can we escape if we simply neglect such a great salvation?"
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.480]   That's why I think this is so relevant to us in our generation where you and I practice
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.520]   our Christianity because this is our primary challenge.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.360]   Reading the gospel, we become so inoculated by the truth where I just signed off on it
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.120]   and then rest of my life I just kind of live like everybody else.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.680]   He says, "See to it that you do not refuse him."
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.160]   What does it mean to refuse him?
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.000]   You don't have to shake your hand and say, "You know what?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I don't believe in God.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.160]   I'm an atheist and I'm going to worship idols."
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.560]   You don't need to do that.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.740]   In fact, that's not what he's addressing in the book of Hebrews.
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:13.200]   To refuse him, first and foremost, is simply to remain willfully ignorant of the truth.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   Willfully ignorant.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.760]   Not ignorant because you haven't been taught.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.400]   Not ignorant because you haven't had access.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.680]   But simply ignorant because you just weren't interested.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.460]   So many people in our generation has no idea what the Bible says.
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.840]   They can tell what the latest album is dropping and what the latest trend is and what athlete
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.200]   has what percentage and what batting average.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.960]   They know all of this stuff but they say, "Turn to the book of Hebrews.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.400]   Turn to a certain passage in the Bible."
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.000]   And after 10, 15, 20, 30 years of being a Christian, they still don't know.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.640]   And it's not because they haven't been taught.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.520]   It just wasn't important enough for them to pursue.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.280]   So we can refuse him by willfully being ignorant of God's word.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.640]   We can be willfully ignorant by studying the word of God and not applying it.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.700]   Like it says in the book of James, you're constantly hearing but not doing.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.360]   Faith without deeds is dead faith.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.080]   This is straight from the Bible.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.460]   It means nothing if you just profess and all it is is a profession and there's no deeds
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.460]   that follow.
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.160]   So we can refuse him by studying and not applying what the Bible has to say.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.840]   Thirdly, you can refuse him by studying what the Bible says and picking and choosing what
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.920]   you want to apply and then certain things that you don't want to apply.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.280]   So partial obedience.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.160]   Obedience only to the things that I want to obey and the things that I don't want to obey.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.240]   I just kind of keep at bay and say, "You know what?
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.240]   God understands.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.820]   We're saved by grace anyway."
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.600]   And so we can refuse him in that way and in every way, every one of the things that I've
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.980]   mentioned, the Bible mentions that that is a form of refusing God.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:00.720]   In 2 Timothy 3, 5 and 7, it says that in the end times, and Paul is warning Timothy as
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.680]   a young pastor preparing him to go to the area of Ephesus to fight wrong doctrines because
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.000]   all these fellow co-workers are starting to drop out and backslide.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.720]   And he's telling them, he's telling Timothy, "I want you to prepare for this.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.480]   This is what you're going to run into as a pastor."
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.960]   He says, "At the end times, you're going to run into people who are holding to a form
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.840]   of godliness, although they have denied its power.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.880]   Avoid such men as these, always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.880]   truth."
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   Form of godliness.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.880]   In other words, they do what you're supposed to do externally.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.920]   They have a reputation of being godly because they know how to play this game.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.320]   They've been in the church for a very long time.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.680]   You know what to say.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.280]   If they ask you how you're doing spiritually, "I'm doing okay," or "I'm struggling,"
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.620]   and you know what you can say.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.620]   You know how to get along.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.240]   So you have a form of godliness, but you have no knowledge of its power.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.520]   That's the distinction between somebody who's excited about his faith and passionately pursuing
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.520]   Christ because you've recognized his power, you've experienced his power, versus somebody
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:20.560]   who's always hearing the sermon but never able to come to the true knowledge of his
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.560]   son, Jesus Christ.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.840]   You notice here in verse 7, he says, "Always learning but never able to come to the knowledge
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.560]   of truth."
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.200]   You notice here, he says, "He's always learning but never knowing."
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.480]   Always learning but never knowing.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.720]   You see the distinction that he's making?
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.600]   That you can study, especially if you're at a Bible-teaching church, we're doing Bible
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.040]   study, and you're going through the verses, and you're always learning.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.760]   You're adding knowledge upon knowledge upon knowledge, but you're never coming and encountering
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:58.240]   Christ because we're refusing him in some way in our life.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:05.680]   We've created this pseudo-Christian life that is completely contrary to what the Bible teaches,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:13.400]   and so you've accumulated so much knowledge about the Bible, but you don't know Christ.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.680]   You know the distinction between somebody who's learning a lot versus somebody who encounters
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.240]   and knows God?
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.120]   Somebody who has a lot of knowledge, the benefit of having a lot of knowledge, that you know
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.760]   that I have that knowledge.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   So the more that I read, the more that I encounter, the more that I want you to know how much
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.680]   I know because that's the benefit of the study.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.280]   But the difference between somebody who's constantly studying and not encountering and
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:48.440]   knowing God is an individual who's always, his knowledge is learning to know Christ.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.640]   And that's the distinction between somebody who's always learning but not knowing Christ
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.840]   versus somebody who's learning and encountering Christ.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.520]   Because a person who is learning to encounter Christ, you'll see in their language, they're
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.760]   going to be talking about who Jesus is.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.640]   But an individual who accumulates a lot of knowledge are going to make sure that you
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.520]   know how much knowledge they have, what books that they've read, people that they know.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:18.620]   That's who he says, that in the church, in our generation, our biggest challenge now
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.520]   is that, where we have a form of godliness.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.560]   You have no knowledge of his power.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:34.840]   See, God's grace reminds us and challenges us and warns us to live according to what's
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.840]   going to last.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.440]   And that's what he was saying in verse 26 and 27.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:45.240]   His voice shook the earth then, but now he is promising yet once more, I will shake not
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.440]   only the earth but also the heaven.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:54.040]   And he's reminding them about when he showed himself at Mount Sinai, where people are terrified
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.560]   and his very presence scared them.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:03.160]   And as he came and he shook the earth, he says, but now God is speaking from heaven.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.800]   It's not just a portion of his glory.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.320]   It wasn't a theophany.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.080]   God himself from heaven is speaking to us directly.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.760]   And he says, yet once more denotes the removing of those things which cannot be shaken as
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:20.880]   of creative things, so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.080]   You know, this building, some of you guys may remember when we were trying to get into
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.400]   this building about four plus years ago.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.120]   You know, we had all these things that we had to do, but most of the things that we
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.720]   did to this building to move in here are things that you wouldn't notice, right?
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:41.880]   Because we deliberately bought this building because we didn't want to do a lot of construction.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:47.840]   So we spent almost, I think about seven, $800,000 fixing this place up.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.600]   Majority of that went to things that you can't see.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.140]   It was because this used to be a plumbing warehouse.
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.840]   And so there weren't a lot of people in this room.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.080]   So in order for us to convert this to a church, because of the number of people coming in
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.320]   and out, the city had a different requirement for the seismic standard, meaning that it
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:13.120]   has to withhold, you know, the building has to be much stronger than a plumbing building,
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.080]   because if an earthquake hits, it needs to be make sure that it doesn't fall.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.040]   So majority of the money went to making holes.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.840]   You know these beams, each one of these beams had to be fortified.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.280]   So we had guys go up there with a drill, maybe about a foot long, and make drills.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:34.440]   And then we had to have, yeah, we had to anchor it.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.440]   I forgot.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.440]   I wasn't looking for anchor.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   I was looking for the screws.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.440]   Okay.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.440]   Bolts.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:48.840]   So we had bolts to anchor each one of the, every one of these beams have about eight
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.760]   anchors in each one of them.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.760]   And it's not just here.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.920]   This is all throughout the building upstairs, even in the cafe area.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:00.160]   So all of that had to be torn down, all the air conditioning, the insulation, all of that
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.240]   had to be torn down and then put, and then just put back up.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.080]   That was majority of the construction in this, in this area.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:12.240]   And so when the inspectors came, they actually had our construction guys go up there and
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.680]   take out some of this stuff to make sure that we did it correctly.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.400]   Because the, all the aesthetic stuff about the stage, about the painting, all this, they
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.080]   didn't care about that stuff.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.760]   The main thing that they cared about was if an earthquake hit, that because then now this
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.640]   is going to be used as a church, we need to make sure that this building is going to be
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.640]   sound.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.840]   So if there's an earthquake, this is the best place to be.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.240]   Right?
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:40.200]   They tell you normally run outside, I would run back in, right?
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.960]   All of that because they want to make sure, especially in California, that if the big
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:52.040]   one hits and it happens to be in the middle of our service, that this building isn't going
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.640]   to easily collapse.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.960]   See, when the Bible says, when the passage in Hebrew says that when he comes, he's going
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.200]   to be shaking things.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.920]   And he repeats this over and over again in these two verses.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:10.200]   It's to remind us that everything that we hold, that's not going to stand the test of
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.960]   the shaking, is not going to make it.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.260]   So this morning, what I want to go over is this shaking.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.880]   What did it mean and what was it teaching and what is he referring to?
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.880]   Right?
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:27.160]   So first of all, when there's a violent shake, when God shows up and there's a violent shake,
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.440]   it was to remind them of the awesomeness of who God is.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.000]   To take his word seriously.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.240]   Exodus chapter 19, verse 18, "Now Mount Sinai was all in smoke because the Lord descended
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.240]   upon it in fire and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace and the whole mountain
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.060]   quaked violently."
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.320]   And then again in Judges 5, 4 to 5, referring to the giving of the law, it says, "The Lord,
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.360]   when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the field of Edom, the earth quaked,
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:01.360]   the heavens also dropped, dripped, even the clouds dripped water, the mountains quaked
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:07.880]   at the presence of the Lord, this Sinai at the presence of the Lord, the God of Israel."
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.480]   You know, I think most Californians have become desensitized to earthquakes, but if you've
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:18.240]   ever had a family member or friend who doesn't live in California and they come to visit
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.480]   or live here for a short period and then a minor earthquake hits, maybe like a 3.0, you
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.120]   know, a 3.0 earthquake for most Californians is nothing, right?
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.000]   But the idea of the earth shifting, I mean, think about that.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.080]   If you've never experienced that before, the earth, we're not talking about strong winds,
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.720]   we're not talking about fire, we're talking about the earth on which your house is built
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.720]   on moves.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:49.760]   I mean, he's reminding them, remember when God showed up and there was a violent quaking
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:56.320]   and that God's presence, even the mountains were shaking in His presence, what do you
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.800]   think that did to the people?
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:04.000]   Automatically, when there was a shaking, they realized something serious, something powerful
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.920]   was coming, that God's presence alone would shake the very foundations of the earth.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.400]   That's what he is referring to.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:19.720]   And yet he says in verse 26, "Yet," do you remember when God spoke from earth, but yet
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.840]   once more, "I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens."
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:31.200]   Everything created is going to be tested when it is in the presence of a holy God.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.520]   That's what it's referring to.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.020]   You know, those of you who've lived in California for a long period of time, you guys remember
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.020]   the Northridge earthquake.
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.560]   Some of you guys may not have been born by then, some of you are a little bit older.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:49.280]   1994, at 4.30 a.m. in Northridge, there was a 6.7 magnitude, right?
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.440]   They said there was over $77 billion of damage that was done.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.260]   So some of you guys who are a little bit older may remember.
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:01.360]   And during that time, basically California was shut down for a long period, especially
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.360]   Northridge.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.760]   You know, we had, I knew somebody who just closed on a house, literally two, three months
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.360]   before the earthquake hit, and there wasn't a single house that wasn't affected by this
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   earthquake.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.080]   It was that big.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:17.400]   Either cracked walls or fences were torn down.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.200]   Freeways collapsed over there.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.920]   Remember the 405?
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.800]   Freeways completely collapsed and you couldn't get around.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.840]   That's how bad Big 6.9 was.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.360]   But as bad as that was, the biggest earthquake that I personally experienced was the one
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.200]   in Whittier, 1987.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.160]   And the reason why that was more devastating to me was because I was in La Mirada that
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.360]   day.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.520]   And La Mirada is the neighboring city to that.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:46.160]   And I was getting ready to go to my Old Testament survey class at 7.45, and the class was at
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.720]   8 o'clock, and I just started seeing this shift like that, just like an earthquake.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.160]   But this one kept on going.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.780]   It got stronger and stronger.
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.140]   And I literally saw the parking lot move like that.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.080]   You know how you have earthquakes that shake and then you have earthquakes that roll?
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.380]   That one was kind of that rolled like that.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.800]   And it was rolling and I thought, "Okay, Jesus is here."
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   Right?
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.580]   Because like, I've experienced earthquake, but nothing like that.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.920]   And then I saw, if you know Biola, most of the buildings in Biola, at least the older
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.080]   buildings are made out of brick.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.940]   And I saw brick buildings curving like that on the parking lot.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.760]   And I'm standing here and I saw cars at the end of the parking lot come up and down like
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.760]   this.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.760]   This is it.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.320]   Earth is opening up, you know, and I'm ready to meet the Lord.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.160]   I had friends who were already in the class jumping out of the window.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.540]   It was on the first floor, so it wasn't that dangerous.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.660]   But they were, everybody was going crazy.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.560]   And I remember like, "Wow, I've never experienced anything like that.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.620]   How can cement and brick move that way?"
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:52.280]   As crazy as that was, on the news they said, "You know, this may be a precursor to something
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.160]   bigger coming."
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.120]   Because ever since I've been in California, the experts, seismologists have been saying
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.080]   the big one is coming and that wasn't the big one.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.080]   Right?
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:08.320]   Even the 6.7 in Whittier, I mean in Northridge, as big as that was, is that all of these things
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.320]   are going to trigger.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.320]   So every time there's an earthquake in California, there's a fear that it's going to trigger
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.320]   the big one.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.040]   And if you may have heard about the big one, and if you haven't heard of it, I'm going
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.280]   to tell you now so that you don't, you need to be informed.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:29.400]   They said that this is going to be so big, there's a possibility that California may
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.880]   crack away from the rest of the country.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.600]   Yeah, that's what they said.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.560]   That's how big the San Andreas Fault is going to be, that we can be a gigantic Hawaii.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.560]   Right?
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.600]   They say that this may happen.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.800]   So what happened was after the '87 earthquake happened, after the '94 earthquake happened,
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.520]   there was a mass exodus from California.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.160]   I know there's a mass exodus right now because of political reasons, but it was nothing like
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.160]   back then.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.200]   Back then people were packing up their bags and moving to Colorado, wherever, outside
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.040]   of California.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:09.960]   Thankfully so, because they were saying that California was going to crack.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:15.360]   So how can you possibly invest in anything here if the earth is going to crack?
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:20.760]   How can you possibly purchase a house if the house can be broken when the earthquake hits?
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.200]   What can you possibly, what are you going to build here if the earthquake is going to
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   come?
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:32.000]   So out of fear, in order to live, people packed up everything and left.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.880]   Obviously, it's been many years since that has happened, but every time there's an earthquake,
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.520]   that announcement gets recirculated.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.520]   It didn't happen.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.520]   It's going to happen.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.200]   It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.720]   So those of us who lived through that, we've become desensitized.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.520]   It's like, "Ah, it's going to happen.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.520]   I heard this before."
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.520]   Right?
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.920]   It's been many years, 20, 30 years have already passed.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.920]   "Yeah, it'll happen.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.440]   I'm sure it'll happen, but maybe not during my lifetime."
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.440]   Right?
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.600]   Those of you who've never heard this before, you know, it's like, "Oh my gosh, is this
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.600]   real?"
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   Well, look it up.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.600]   I'm not making this up.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.600]   This is real.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.600]   Right?
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   Why am I saying all of this stuff?
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:15.160]   Because the author of Hebrews is reminding us that no matter how great of an earthquake
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:21.920]   you may have experienced in the past, when Jesus comes in his full glory, whatever human
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.320]   history has experienced is going to pale in comparison.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:32.440]   For some reason, we have presented the gospel in such a way that Jesus is still this meek,
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:37.920]   humble servant who's on his knees looking for people's feet to wash.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.400]   And all of these things are true.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.400]   It's in the Bible.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.600]   But have you read Revelation?
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.960]   Because Revelation is just as important as the Gospel of John.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.960]   Have you read Revelation?
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.720]   When he comes in his glory, he's not coming as a humble servant.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.320]   He's coming as the King of kings and Lord of lords.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.280]   Go back and read chapter one.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.880]   Go back and read the rest of Revelation.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.080]   Jesus is coming in his full glory.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.240]   And when he comes, the Bible says, "The earth will shake."
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.720]   And this shaking is going to be much greater than what happened in Mount Sinai.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:16.680]   In Revelation 6, 12, it says, "I looked when he broke the sixth seal, and there was a great
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:22.080]   earthquake, and the sun became black and sackcloth made of air, and the whole moon became like
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.080]   blood."
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.960]   Revelation 11, 13, "And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.960]   city fell.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.280]   Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.840]   Seven thousand people were killed, and rest were terrified, and gave glory to God of heaven."
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.960]   Isn't that strange?
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.960]   People are dying.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   They're terrified.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:48.040]   And yet it says God was receiving the glory, right?
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.440]   Because they knew.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.680]   They knew in the presence of God's glory, all this was happening because of his presence,
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.800]   not because of lack of his presence.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:02.600]   In Revelation 16, 17-20, "And the seventh angel poured out his bowl upon the air."
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.480]   This is the last judgment that is explained.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.960]   "And a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, 'It is done.'"
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.960]   The judgment is done.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.200]   "And there were flashes and lightning sounds and peals of thunder, and there was a great
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:21.640]   earthquake, such as there had not been since man came to be upon the earth.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.200]   So great an earthquake was it, and so mighty."
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:32.960]   So there is trembling throughout the judgment, and then it ends with the greatest trembling
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.600]   that mankind has ever seen.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:41.920]   He says all of this to reveal that God in his full glory will come.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.280]   Are we ready for this?
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.880]   We know that the earth, when it shakes, it deserves all of us.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.960]   And some people are willing to pack up and go somewhere else.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.440]   Rightfully so.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:01.560]   But yet, do we believe that when he comes, that anything that you and I have experienced
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.720]   is going to pale in comparison?
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.120]   So when there is a quaking in the Bible, it is to remind us of the awesomeness of God's
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.720]   presence that's coming.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:17.280]   But secondly, when a quaking happens, the Bible says that it is to test and to purify
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.200]   and make sure that all the non-essentials are shaken off.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.980]   In Hebrews 12, verse 27, this expression yet once more denotes the removing of those things
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:32.940]   which can be shaken as the creative thing, so that those things which cannot be shaken
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.960]   may remain.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:44.560]   God allows some shaking in our lives at times to cause us to take a second look and see
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.240]   how valuable these things are.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.200]   Are these things going to make it?
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   That's why we have all these things that are placed in so that when the earthquake comes,
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.400]   that we can make it through the earthquake.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.800]   But this building hasn't been tested.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.160]   Even though it's all there, all the preparation has been made, the city would not allow us
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.380]   to come into this building unless the preparation has been made, but it hasn't been tested.
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:16.160]   The Bible says that God allows smaller tremors in our life to test the quality of our faith.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:21.680]   In 1 Peter 1, 6-7, in this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary,
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.700]   you have been distressed by various trials.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:29.640]   So that the proof of your faith being more precious than gold, which is perishable, even
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.920]   though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory, honor and revelation
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.520]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:43.160]   When the great judgment day comes, the only thing that's going to matter, the only thing
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:48.880]   that's going to save us, the only thing that's going to have value is the quality of our
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:54.600]   faith, which is going to cover us from the wrath that is to come.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:25:00.080]   So he allows us to experience the tremors to test the quality of our faith.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.080]   That's what he says.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:08.480]   Like I said, this building has been prepared for a greater seismic, you know, if it does
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.960]   come, but it hasn't been tested.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.000]   But you know what has been tested?
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.680]   My house.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.320]   My house has been tested and it's tested all the time.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.040]   The reason why it's tested is because we live next to a train track, right?
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.440]   We've been living next to a train track for over 10 to 12 years.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.000]   And so when you first live next to a train track, like it's kind of disturbing.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.660]   And I don't think that's a place that a lot of people would like to live because your
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.240]   house is always shaking, right?
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.200]   I've gotten so used to it, like I don't even notice.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:43.080]   In fact, unless the earthquake is anything below 4.5, I don't even wake up because I
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.520]   go, "Oh, this is a train."
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.880]   But that house that we live in is constantly shaking.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.860]   So you know when the Metro goes by?
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:55.140]   I know it's a Metro with people on it because it moves fast and it's pretty light.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.880]   And it comes and it shakes for a little while like this and then it's gone.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:03.720]   But I know when those freight trains come, you know, it's long, slow moving, heavy, and
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.720]   really it rumbles.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.740]   It literally just rumbles like this.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:10.360]   And whatever conversation we have, we have to stop for a second.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.180]   Unless we have the window closed.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.700]   So there is no settling in our house.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.900]   You know, most houses, especially the newer ones, you buy it and then, you know, in the
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.580]   middle of the night, you'll hear creaking.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.540]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.460]   It's not the ghost.
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:27.500]   It's your house, just kind of the weight of the house just kind of settling and the slight
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.180]   movements of the wood.
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:33.340]   You know, so if you're a new house owner, you know, that's what happens to a house.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.000]   It takes years and the house just kind of settles, right?
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.100]   Our house has been settled.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.100]   I don't hear any creak.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:43.900]   I've lived in other houses, but I usually don't hear any creaks in our house because
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.180]   whatever creaking settling is going to happen, it's happened.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.180]   Right?
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.580]   Because every day it's being tested.
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.580]   Right?
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:56.660]   Now, we haven't been tested by a magnitude of that size, but the small tremors does nothing
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.660]   to our house.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.660]   Right?
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.660]   And it's deliberately built that way.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.740]   And homes in California are better built for that reason because we're used to tremors.
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.740]   Right?
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.340]   And, again, I don't want to go sidetracked, but there's a reason why Californians don't
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:10.340]   have basements.
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.620]   It's because of the earthquakes.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.340]   Right?
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:19.140]   All of this to say, the Bible is telling us that in the end when Christ comes, all things
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.620]   are going to be tested.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:27.280]   And the only thing that survives from this test is going to be in eternity with him.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.440]   And so what is the purpose of all of that?
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:36.660]   To invest in things that's going to stand the test of time when Christ comes.
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.620]   God allows certain things to happen in our life to test.
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:43.900]   But you know what I found out through the years, that the greatest test all throughout
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:50.420]   history hasn't been the hardships, the persecutions, and the difficulties.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.860]   You know, when this pandemic hit, even non-Christians were praying.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:28:01.700]   I heard rap stars, you know, like most vulgar lyrics saying, "We need to pray.
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.380]   We need to pray."
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:09.900]   Even non-Christians who have no faith in God, when hardship comes, know that they need something
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.560]   outside of them.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:20.340]   The greatest testing of our faith, I found, that most people, a lot of people, don't make
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.060]   is when we are not pressed.
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:28.460]   When our bills are paid, and things are good, and family is good.
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.900]   And we see that same pattern in the Old Testament.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:38.260]   When the Israelites had the greatest problem was when bills were paid, when they didn't
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.180]   have enemies, when life was secure.
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.180]   And what happened?
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.180]   They got proud.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.180]   They forgot God.
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:51.260]   And as soon as they forgot God, they started slipping into idolatry.
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.540]   Every day we are being tested.
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:58.460]   You know, one of the benefits of this pandemic is it's forced us to look at things that are
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.580]   essential, right?
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.980]   And who knew toilet paper was so essential, right?
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.060]   But it's like toilet paper somehow is essential.
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.820]   You know, we think water is essential.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.900]   Food is essential.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:16.900]   And then as a church, we have to take a step back and ask ourselves, how essential is our
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.900]   church?
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.620]   How essential is our gathering?
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:25.300]   So we were wrestling through all of this when the non-Christian world says the church is
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.300]   not essential.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.300]   It's understandable.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.380]   But they didn't get mad at them saying that because they don't believe God.
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:37.120]   So to them, liquor stores are essential because liquor can calm you down.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:41.340]   So when they have hardship and they're freaking out, you know, go to the liquor store and
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.780]   get some liquor and then put it in their body to calm them down.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.060]   But church, this is just a placebo.
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.060]   It's not essential.
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.700]   So it's understandable.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:56.080]   People who don't know Christ will label the church non-essential because it's not doing
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.700]   anything other than giving you a security blanket to make you feel better.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:04.820]   At least liquor, there's something tangible that you're doing.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:11.100]   The shocking thing was so many churches just embrace that.
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:18.300]   What is essential in our life that we need to hold on to and fight for and to pursue
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:24.500]   that when Christ comes that we will not think that we wasted our lives?
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:29.520]   We are being tested constantly to see what is essential?
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.960]   What is really essential?
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:37.280]   What is going to test the shaking when Christ comes?
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.600]   I remember years ago, you know, he was pretty young then.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.600]   He was a 20-year-old.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.200]   And it was during a period when there was the ear piercing.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.840]   I'm not just talking about any ear piercing, but you pierce and then you make it into a
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:55.220]   size of a pencil and then the next stage is to make it a nickel size and then the next
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.300]   stage was a quarter size.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.980]   So you might not remember.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.660]   I think it's been maybe about 17, 16, 17 years ago.
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:09.640]   And so, you know, this guy, he was in a band and he already had a hole in there that was
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.640]   the size of a pencil.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:15.860]   And he asked me, what do you think about making it larger to a quarter?
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.460]   And I said, you know, I don't have any particular problem.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.460]   There's no Bible verse I'm going to quote you and say you can't do that.
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:28.240]   But let me just give you some worldly wisdom as an older brother.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.060]   It's cool right now, right?
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:34.060]   And you're part of a band, so maybe that kind of fits your MO, but you're not going to be
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.060]   in that for long.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.860]   And one day it may not be cool, right?
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.200]   Because there's nothing new under the sun.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:47.980]   Everything that was cool when we were younger is very dorky today.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:52.980]   It's not even not cool, it's just dorky.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:57.340]   But there's going to come a time when you're going to walk up one day and then you're going
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:03.580]   to see a big hole that you can't close up and you're not going to think it's cool, but
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.020]   it's going to be there permanently.
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:10.340]   So I know you don't understand, you may not agree with what I say now, but I told him,
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:16.860]   you're 20 years old, 10 years ago when you were 10, what do you think?
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.580]   Are there things that you said and did and valued when you were 10 year old that as a
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.300]   20 year old, it's like, that is so dumb.
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.300]   That is so dorky, right?
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:29.220]   So yeah, there's a bunch of stuff I did when I was 10 years old.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.940]   Okay, so now you're 10 years more mature.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:36.660]   Do you think that you have reached the peak of your maturity at the age of 20, that another
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:41.020]   10 years from now when you're 30, that you're not going to look back at the things that
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:48.500]   you did when you were 20 and then say, well, that was dorky, that was dumb, it was so cool
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:55.540]   then, but at a 30 year old, and you think that stops at 30?
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.860]   You think you can wake up when you're 40 and look back at things that you did at your 30
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:05.300]   and then realize like, oh, I wish I had this knowledge then.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.100]   All our life, we're not at our final destiny.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:14.500]   So things that were so important at that period of our life, it doesn't stand the test of
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.380]   time.
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:20.180]   And so God is speaking to us from eternity.
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:26.820]   The things that seem so important at that moment is going to seem like nothing in the
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.460]   context of eternity.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:33.780]   And so as a 20 year old is wise to listen to a 30 year old and 30 year old is wise to
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:37.500]   listen to a 40 year old, 40 year old, why is this still 50 year old and on and on and
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.060]   on.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.060]   God is speaking from heaven.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:45.780]   That's why he said, do not refuse him because God knows what's going to stand the test of
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.660]   time.
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:54.500]   And all that we have been entangled with and concerned about in the end may not even matter.
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.420]   That's what he's saying.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:00.460]   So pursue the things that matter, pursue the things that you're not going to regret in
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:04.980]   10 years, 20 years, 50 years, 100 years, 1,000 years later, that you're not going to look
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:10.540]   back at this, that short period of time that you and I are living and miss that comes and
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:17.860]   goes and to forfeit the blessing that God has for us in eternity.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:24.260]   When he comes in full glory, a radical change of values are going to happen when we are
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.420]   in Christ.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:34.340]   All that after the violent shaking of his coming, only true faith, only the things that
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:35.340]   last for eternity.
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:41.660]   And that's why he says in John chapter 6, 27, do not work for the food which perishes,
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.420]   but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the son of man will give to you
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.100]   for on him, the father, God has set his seal.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.960]   In other words, he's ordained it, right?
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:58.200]   To pursue the things that God has ordained for eternity, not for the moment.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.720]   You know, I mentioned tattoos in the first service and I had to push back.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   People are very uncomfortable.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.800]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.840]   I don't have anything against tattoos, okay?
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.480]   So you say, "Oh, he's a legalist."
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.440]   I don't have anything against tattoos, but it applies to tattoos, right?
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.540]   I don't have anything against tattoos, okay?
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.540]   Don't come up to me after service.
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:26.620]   I already told you, okay?
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.420]   Some tattoos have meaning, right?
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:33.500]   And I've seen people with tattoos that have meanings.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.820]   I'm military guys who's lost their, you know, their fellow soldiers or people who've lost
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:38.820]   their children.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.180]   I've seen things with meaning, but there's a lot of things that you're going to put on
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.860]   your body that's not going to look too good, right?
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.060]   When you're 40, 60, 80.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.820]   So I have nothing against it.
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:56.020]   I'm just telling you from an older brother in Christ, give it a little bit more thought,
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.460]   right?
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:01.300]   What's cool today, and I'm only picking on tattoo, but that applies to everything in
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.500]   life, right?
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:08.260]   What seems cool today for the moment is going to pass.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.900]   And like I said, it is not just tattoos.
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:19.580]   It's the homes that we purchase, the clothes that we buy, the experiences that we want,
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:27.980]   the accolades of people, the next stage of our job, in our career, the opinions of men
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.940]   and women.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:35.460]   All of these things in time will pass.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.500]   So therefore, he says to invest in things that are eternal.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:42.660]   And there's four things that the Bible says that will stand the test of time.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.060]   One is God himself.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.580]   God himself will not change.
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.820]   He's the same yesterday, today, and forevermore.
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:54.180]   So if we're going to be concerned about building anything, if we're going to be pursuing anything,
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.860]   to pursue the kingdom of God.
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.500]   And that's why it says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.660]   be added unto you."
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.300]   First, is he our priority?
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.860]   Number two, the word of God.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.860]   The word of God.
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:10.820]   First Peter 1, 24, 25, "For all flesh, like grass, and all its glory, like the flowers
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:11.820]   of grass.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.560]   The grass withers, and the flower falls off.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.900]   But the word of the Lord endures forever.
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.940]   And this is the word which was preached to you."
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.660]   This is why we emphasize the word so much in our church, because everything else that
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:27.700]   is trendy for the moment will pass.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:33.240]   But God's word that he has ordained a thousand years ago, two thousand years ago, six thousand
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:38.380]   years ago, still remains to be proven to be true today.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.020]   And it will last forever.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:44.480]   The church of God, when Jesus says, "I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.820]   not prevail against it."
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:51.080]   That's why we commit to the building of the church, more than anything else.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.560]   Because he said he's going to commit to it.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.480]   He's going to make sure that it's going to stand the shaking of time.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:03.360]   So therefore, to commit to what he has committed to, the building up of the body of Christ.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:10.640]   And third and finally, your salvation and my salvation is secure in Christ.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:16.400]   In Romans 8, 37-39, "But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through him who
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.680]   loved us.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.500]   For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:26.080]   things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.640]   things, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.480]   Lord."
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:38.920]   Our identity in Christ is secure, if our faith is proven to be genuine.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.760]   And that's why when the disciples came back, and they were rejoicing over the fact that
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.560]   the demons were submitting to them.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.160]   They were excited, just common fishermen went back, and they were able to cast out demons,
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.920]   like, "Wow, this is exciting."
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.360]   And Jesus says, "Great, and you're going to see greater things.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.440]   But if you're going to rejoice over everything, rejoice that your name is written in the book
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.480]   of life.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.540]   Everything else will come and go.
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.760]   Sometimes you will see fruit, sometimes you will not.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.280]   Sometimes you will experience peace, sometimes you will not.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.840]   But the love of God remains forever."
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.240]   So that's what he means.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:23.640]   He said, "When you hear the voice of God, do not refuse him who speaks from heaven.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.920]   There is eternal consequences."
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:31.720]   So my prayer is that no matter what we are going through, no matter what we are distracted
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:39.880]   by, that there's a need for us to constantly test, are the things that I am pursuing temporary
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.880]   things?
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.400]   Are the things that I am so concerned about temporary things?
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.840]   Are the things that I spend all my money on, are they temporary?
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:55.040]   Am I genuinely pursuing the things that will last the test of his coming?
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.240]   I pray that that may be the case.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:02.800]   Let's pray.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.640]   So again, as our worship team comes, if we can take a few minutes to come before the
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:12.600]   Lord and genuinely examine our life.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.600]   What am I pursuing?
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   What do I value?
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.600]   What do I rejoice over?
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.320]   What do I weep over?
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:22.120]   Are they things that are eternal or are they things that are temporal?
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:26.520]   Lord search me and know me, see if there's any hurtful ways in me.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.720]   And ask the Lord to reveal these things so that we may continue to follow Christ, not
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.560]   live in a pattern where we refuse him.
