[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.160]   Hi, my name is Alice and I'm a senior at UCI and this is my testimony.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.080]   My parents began going to an apostolic denomination church when I was little.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.280]   Then as I grew up, we went to a Baptist denomination church after they found out there was a deaf
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.120]   church congregation there.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.840]   After a few years of being there, we returned to the apostolic church.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.800]   In the midst of transitioning back and forth between churches, I never took my faith seriously.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.880]   Instead, I viewed church as a place that I was forced to go to.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.200]   As I grew up, I continued to be a nominal Christian.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.120]   I would only read scripture on Sundays because of sermons.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.400]   I never really saw a point in reading my Bible.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.160]   It was just a book that I had to carry with me on Sundays to church.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.400]   My prayers would only happen at church and consisted of either apologies for "bad things"
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.920]   I did or asking for things I wanted.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.840]   I saw Jesus as a genie that could grant me the desires of my heart.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.680]   During my senior year of high school, I began to face very difficult experiences.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.560]   That year, I fell into deep depression and anxiety after experiencing conflicts with
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.640]   a close friend of mine at the time.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.200]   I sinfully put all my worth in my friendship with her and it slowly broke me down.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.640]   After a year of struggling with my mental health, I wanted to leave my hometown of San
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.400]   Francisco for college.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.480]   With only three options and only one being in Southern California, I opted for Whittier
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.560]   College.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.760]   I thought this was my way to get a fresh start.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.040]   During my first year of college, I continued to struggle with depression and anxiety.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.600]   I placed my identity in friendships and held other people above God.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.160]   I thought meeting new people would fulfill my needs but quickly realized it did not.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.800]   At the same time that year, God placed a desire in me to grow in my faith, so I wanted to
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.960]   find a church that I could attend.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.760]   I stumbled upon a friend of a friend's Facebook page and on there, I found YouTube videos
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.920]   of her college experience.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.560]   In those videos, she documented her time at Berean, attending car rallies, sports day,
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.640]   and so on.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.960]   I really wanted to go but I had no means of transportation.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.360]   I ended up finding a church closer to me that I could attend.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.600]   It was there that I began to learn more about God.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.480]   I was still living for the world as I had a shallow understanding of God.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.120]   After my first year of college, I returned home to San Francisco to attend community
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.280]   college.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.880]   That small desire to grow the year before disappeared after I came home.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.000]   I became more focused on transitioning to my new school.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.160]   I never felt a genuine connection when I went to church growing up and being at home was
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.320]   a reminder of that.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.400]   I decided to stop attending church completely that year as it seemed pointless to go.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.560]   In November of 2018, I applied to transfer from community college and was accepted into
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.560]   UCI.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.000]   I accepted the offer and came down to Irvine during September of 2019.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.400]   Before coming, I remembered those YouTube videos and from that, I knew I wanted to at
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.400]   least visit Berean.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.320]   When I first started attending at the beginning of my junior year, God opened my eyes to see
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.560]   his holiness and convicted me of the truth of who I am.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.000]   I began to see my true nature as a sinner before a perfect God.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.920]   I was on the path to hell, but God, in his rich grace and mercy, sent his one and only
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.540]   son Jesus to die on the cross for my sins so I can be reconciled with the Father.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.920]   My college experience has been anything but smooth.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.520]   Yet, as I look back, I see how sovereign God was working through these events to lead me
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.840]   closer to him.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.440]   I needed to go through those times to see that I need Christ every single day of my
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.960]   life.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   Even though I still struggle with sin, I am thankful to God because I am no longer
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   a slave to sin.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.200]   It is through his great mercy and sweet grace that I am able to pursue holiness in him.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.140]   As I continue to live my life, I recognize how much my life is not my own but belongs
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.880]   to God.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.200]   As Galatians 2.20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ and it is no longer I who live,
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.600]   but Christ lives in me.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.240]   And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.840]   me and gave himself up for me."
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840]   Thank you.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.840]   (Applause)
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:17.840]   >> I would like to introduce our next speaker.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:30.840]   (Applause)
