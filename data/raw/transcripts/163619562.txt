[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   "Certainly I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.600]   When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God on this mountain."
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.100]   Then Moses said to God, "Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel, and I say to them,
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.600]   'The God of your fathers has sent me to you.' Now they may say to me, 'What's his name?'
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.600]   What shall I say to them?" And God said to Moses, "I am who I am."
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.000]   And he said, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.700]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.200]   Father, we again want to ask that you would grant great light and insight into your Word.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.900]   We pray, God, that your scriptures would continue to do a work of sanctification in our lives.
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:57.500]   And God, as we take a look at this precious name, this profound and such a crucial revelation of who you are,
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.400]   I pray, God, that we would have a greater sight and perspective as to the nature of our God,
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.200]   and that ultimately this would absolutely change our lives. We thank you it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.200]   Okay. Well, I want to ask, how many of you guys are afraid of spiders in this room?
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.000]   A good number of you guys, you know. And you do realize it's completely irrational, right?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.800]   To be afraid of something literally as small as your thumb, or even smaller, right?
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.900]   Well, just recently I saw one of these viral videos on YouTube where this man, he was a giant of a man.
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.700]   I mean, he, well the video says he was like 6'5", you know.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.100]   And he's sitting there, and he's just like wringing his shoe in his hand, and he's going, "Ahhhhhh!"
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.500]   And you're wondering like, "What's this guy doing?"
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.500]   And all of a sudden you hear in the background the wife's like video, and she's like, "Do it! Be a man!"
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.800]   You know? And then it spans up, and there's a little spider on the roof.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.300]   He's like 6'5", so he can just kill it, and he's like, "I can't do it!" You know?
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.500]   And then, next thing you know, she's rationalizing with him.
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.000]   He's like, she's saying, "You're right there! You're 6'5", you're huge!" You know?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.500]   And he's like, "I can't!" He gets close, and he's like, "Ahhhhhh! No, I can't do it!"
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500]   And then she starts to question his manhood, you know?
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   He's like, "You're a man, you know, people be a sissy," all this kind of stuff.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.300]   And in the end he goes, "Ahhhh!" And he throws his shoe, you know?
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.300]   And the video is kind of hilarious, but at the same time we realize whenever we have a fear, it grips us.
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.300]   There's a part of it that it is rational. Spiders are scary. Some of them are venomous.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.300]   And the thing about spiders is they're just so sneaky, you know?
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.800]   They come out of nowhere. They survive everything. You try to drown them, but they still survive.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   So yes, I get it that sometimes they're afraid.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.300]   But on the flip side, it's completely irrational.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.300]   You're literally like a hundred times bigger, if not more, than that spider.
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.300]   I mean, that spider is at your mercy, and here you are wringing your hands, like, "Oh my gosh, can I really do this?"
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.300]   And the wife is behind you, "Do it!" You know?
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:07.300]   Well, the reason why I talk about this is because in our story last week, we talked about how Moses fled Egypt.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.800]   And I believe there was a great fear in his heart. Okay?
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.300]   There was a huge fear in his heart.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.300]   The Pharaoh wanted to kill Moses. Of course there's a fear in his heart.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:28.300]   And what's more, it's clear that as he's sojourning, as he's running away into the land of the millions, he has a fear in his heart.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:35.300]   Now, the next event that hit us, or hit Moses, was that God interrupted his life.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.300]   And he revealed himself in this blaze of fire from a bush.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.800]   And there was an audible voice coming, like that, you know, it says an angel appeared, essentially.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   And this angel taught Moses that simply the manifestation of God's glory in this form is so holy, Moses cannot approach.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.300]   And the scripture says that Moses was filled with fear. Okay?
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:09.300]   So here's an individual, already fearful, but now encountering the fearful and awesome presence of God.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:18.800]   But what we see in this interaction between God and Moses is that the fear that gripped his heart is irrational and it's unreconcilable.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   To the degree that Moses continues to resist the calling of God as God is commissioning him to go and deliver the people.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.300]   And so what we're going to read and what we're going to see is the interaction between God and Moses.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.800]   And we're going to see the heart of Moses that's gripped by fear.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.300]   And from it I hope we can learn a great encouragement of how to overcome that fear for us.
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.300]   Well, let's begin with verse 10 and 11.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:52.300]   And let me read it again, it says, "Therefore come now, I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring my people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:00.800]   But Moses said to God, 'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?'"
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.300]   And so this is where we're going to go from this sermon is we're going to see Moses' fear in the words and excuses he says.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.300]   And then we'll see the response of God. Okay?
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.300]   The first fear that we see when he says, "Who am I?"
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.800]   That is a fear of his own shame and inadequacy. Right?
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.800]   It's a fear of his, it's a self-doubt. It's a self-doubting fear. Okay?
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:36.300]   And what he has there essentially saying is, "Okay, I heard you. You've seen the needs of the people and you've heard and you've come.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.800]   But why do you got to involve me into this? Who am I? I can't go to Pharaoh.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   I can't go to the nation, you know, the leaders of Israel. I can't deliver these people."
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   Now, there's a sense to which his questioning is right.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.800]   Because this isn't like fighting the other shepherds. This isn't like fighting another man.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   He's going up against the superpower of that time. You know what I mean?
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.800]   He's going against the reigning, you know, empire of that generation.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.800]   And he's thinking that he's going to go to Pharaoh and just be like, "Hey, let all the people go. Okay?"
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.800]   And we're talking about hundreds and thousands of people, if not a million.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   So, this isn't no small task. So rightly, we might think, Moses is saying, "I don't think I'm up for this task."
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   Now, what's really interesting about this is, I was reading a lot of R.C. Sproul's commentary on this.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   Because, you know, he writes a lot about the holiness of God. And this is one of the passages that he writes a lot about.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   But what was really interesting is he said that he thought Moses was then having an appropriate question.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:58.800]   As to, when you see the glory of God, and then the mission of God, you naturally have like a, "Oh, the sense of, I am lowly servant. I can't do this."
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   So he said, he said this statement that, he made the point that, when you see the glory of God in that light, naturally you're low.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   And you know what the thing about it is, I absolutely agree with that.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   You know, when you have an appropriate view of God, you will naturally see yourself.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:23.800]   And quoting John Calvin, he said this, "A man never attains to a true self-knowledge until he has previously contemplated the face of God.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   And upon that, he comes down after such contemplation to look into himself."
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.800]   This is the only way we truly know ourselves.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   And so simply put, knowing yourself begins with knowing God. Absolutely.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   But, is that what's happening here?
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   Is Moses having an appropriate questioning of himself before the glory of God?
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   And my case would be, no.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   What's happening here is Moses is filled with fear in his heart, and he's now making excuses, disobeying God.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   Because what you see in context immediately, and what you see in broader context, is that as Moses is seeing and experiencing God, he is interacting with God.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.800]   But step by step, he is giving excuses as to why he doesn't want to do what God says you should do.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   And Moses' perspective is wrong to the degree that God expresses his frustration.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.800]   And later it would say that God burns in his anger towards Moses.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:31.800]   This is not a scenario where Moses is having a godly, humble view of himself.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   This is a scenario in which in fear, he is fearing and doubting what he would be.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.800]   What he would be. This is an issue of self-doubt.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   And the reason why I say this is because, let's just think back to the broader context of what Moses is experiencing.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   Moses' heart was truly filled with fear.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   To the degree that he would run away.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   And while running away to the Midianites, he would say, "I am a sojourner."
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   And then once he meets his wife and he has a son, he names his son Gershom.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   You know what Gershom means? I mentioned it last time.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   It means, "I don't belong here." It means, "I am a foreigner."
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   Imagine how it must grieve you that you had to leave the high position.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   How much fear it must have, or how much self-doubting that it must have caused in his heart that he starts naming his kid like that.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   One of the things I fear is being bald.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   Truthfully speaking, I am 33 and pretty young, but I am thinning out a lot.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   So I have to do my "Going before the Lord, you know God, being bald or having hair is nothing.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   I really need to focus on you and be content."
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   But imagine if I lost that battle and I was like, "Oh no, I am going to be bald."
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   And all of a sudden, just to remind everybody that I am this sad, I start calling my kids, "Hey Baldie."
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.800]   "Hey Q-Ball." I just start bowling ball this and shine this.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   I just start naming the things around me according to the bitterness in my heart over this issue.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   My point is, Moses is very much disturbed by the fact that his life so far, it has such an ups and downs and there is a great fear.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   And so you can imagine if God is calling him, "I want you to go back to Pharaoh."
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.800]   "Pharaoh? Seriously? He was out to kill me."
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   "I want you to go back to the Israelites, the leaders of the Israelites."
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:37.800]   I mean, they remember Moses, the Hebrew who lived up in the palace, who thought he was going to be judge and he thought he was going to do this.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   And he killed a man and now he is on the run. Of course they remember him.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   How could I go?
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.800]   And automatically you have the self-doubting and the view of self like, "I can't."
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   You know, even if we do one silly thing, you know, you wave to somebody but they are not really waving at you.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.800]   And then you run away because now you feel an awareness of yourself.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.800]   Right?
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   Moses definitely feels an awareness of himself and there is a fear.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   Now I went at length at this but I want to prove this point to you with another passage, Acts chapter 7, verse 23 to 28.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   So please turn your Bibles there.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   Acts chapter 7, verse 23 to 28.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   This is an interesting passage because this is Stephen giving a defense as people are persecuting him and just before he has martyred him.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   He is giving a defense of how he believes in both Moses, the law, the temple and how he values all of that.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   And in so doing he gives a little commentary on Moses.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   Starting from verse 23.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.800]   It says, "But when he was approaching the age of 40, it entered his mind to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:53.800]   And when he saw one of them being treated unjustly, he defended him and took vengeance for the oppressed by striking the Egyptian.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance through him, but they did not understand."
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   Do you see that?
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.800]   He is commentating on our story that we are studying.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   And this was while he was in Egypt.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.800]   He struck down that Egyptian.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.800]   It commentated on what Moses believed.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   Moses already had in his mind that maybe God is using me to judge or discern for these people and help them and deliver them.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   What am I saying?
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.800]   By the people rejecting him, it's like, "Who made you judge?
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.800]   Who do you think you are?
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.800]   You're going to kill us too?"
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   You know, Moses is taking a back.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   My case is, Moses already feels like a grand failure because he thought he was going to be delivered already before.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.800]   And now God is calling him and saying, "I want you to go back and you can imagine the kind of fear in his heart.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.800]   I was already there.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   I already failed.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.800]   I can't show my face over there anymore.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.800]   Who am I?"
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   So I don't think he's making this godly question of, "God, I'm just a lonely man.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   Thank you for giving me this opportunity to serve you."
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   No, he has a fear that's gripping his heart.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   What is God's response to that?
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.800]   Well, God gives him so much grace and God encourages his heart by saying this.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   Jump back to Exodus 3, verse 12.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   Sorry.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:28.800]   And he says, "Certainly, I will be with you and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:34.800]   When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain."
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.800]   I think that's quite amazing.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.800]   He says, "I will be with you."
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   So the question, the answer to your question, "Who am I, God?"
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   You are the one whom I am with.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   My presence is going to be with you.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   And God being the God that he is, he sees through what Moses is saying.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.800]   He might be like, "Ah, I can't do this.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.800]   I don't have the skill," or whatever it may be.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.800]   But God sees right through that.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   "I see your fear. I want to encourage you now."
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   He doesn't really answer the question, "This is who you are," does he?
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   God doesn't say, "Remember who you are.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   I was sovereign before you were born.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   I was sovereign with your mom and I was sovereign with the midwives and I was sovereign with the Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.800]   Remember how I raised you in the palace and I gave you the greatest food and I gave you the greatest education?
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   You can do it!"
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   You know, like God didn't say that.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   God just said, "Moses, I see your fear.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.800]   I'm with you.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.800]   And I'm going to show you that I'm with you.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   And I'm going to show you that I'm the one who sent you.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   And I'm going to show you by, he says, "I'm going to sovereignly make it so that you will worship exactly in this place."
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   Wow. That's awesome.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   So by way of application, we see Moses' excuse and then we see God's response.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.800]   What God is doing is giving Moses a perspective.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   He's not only answering the question, but he's giving a perspective.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   "My presence is with you.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   And there is your security."
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   Remember, God explained to Moses, "I've seen, I've heard, I've given my attention, and now I've come.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.800]   Now you come to me and I'll send you, but I will accomplish this deliverance."
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   The perspective is, "God, God, God, God, God, and then me."
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.800]   Like this.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.800]   But I bet you in Moses' perspective, it's like, "I have to go to Pharaoh.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.800]   I have to go talk to the Israelites.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.800]   I have to deliver them.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.800]   I can't take all these people.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.800]   I."
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.800]   Every single one of us, we have to do an entire paradigm shift.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   Our worldview, our questioning of how to make a decision cannot start with us.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   Otherwise, you will automatically fail in every occasion.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   You need to have a broader perspective of God.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.800]   You need to think of how is God working?
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   What is his desire?
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.800]   How has he been supplying?
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.800]   How is he going to fulfill?
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.800]   And then you realize your role in the vast majority of what you do is like this.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   Apostle Paul asked the question, "Who is sufficient for these things?"
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   And he's talking about his ministry.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   And the fact of the matter is, I think about that all the time.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.800]   Who is sufficient for ministry?
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:29.800]   And if I were to think at any moment that unless I do X, Y, and Z, this is going to fail,
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   I'm already set up for failure.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.800]   Who is sufficient for anything we do?
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.800]   Parenting.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.800]   Any parent in here would know, like, I try my best.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.800]   I try to give it my all, but still there's so many things I could be doing.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   There's literally a limitless number of things that you could be doing.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   You can commit all your--you can have a full-time thing, which a lot of our parents do, amen,
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.800]   but still feel like I've inadequately given of myself, right?
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   So the fact of the matter is, if your worldview is still centered around you,
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   there's your first failure.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   You need to have a reordering of your perspective.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   You need to have a different order of your perspective, a different scale of your perspective,
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.800]   that God dominates your perspective.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   Well, this is the first point.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   The hard part is, and the problem is this,
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.800]   Moses is told, "Hey, realize this. I am with you." Right?
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.800]   And the fact of the matter is, a lot of us in this room, we know that.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   We know God is everywhere.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.800]   I mean, good theologian, God is omnipresent.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   There's nowhere we can go. We escape his presence, okay.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   But the fact of the matter is, Moses at this point, he's being introduced to God.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.800]   And so just saying, "Hey, God's with you," it's not helping.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   You see why?
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   Because it doesn't help to just be like, "Hey."
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   You know, so for example, if someone told, if I was pouring out my heart and I said,
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.800]   "Oh my gosh, I'm struggling."
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.800]   "Don't worry. Christopher is with you."
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.800]   "Who's Christopher?"
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.800]   It doesn't help to say he is with me if I don't understand the nature of who he is.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.800]   And so we move to the center of this sermon and the most important part of this passage
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.800]   about the nature of God.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.800]   But we begin with Moses' question, again from fear.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.800]   Verse 13.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   So Moses hears God and then afterwards Moses replies,
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.800]   "Then Moses said to God, 'Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel,
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   and I will say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you.'
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   Now they may say to me, 'What is his name?'"
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.800]   "What am I going to say?"
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   First we saw the fear of his self-doubt and fear of his own shame.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   Now we see his fear of the masses.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   He has the fear of man gripping him.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   He can already play it out in his head and we can play it out in our heads.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.800]   If you've ever done any kind of public speaking, I mean you play it out in your head
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   of what you're going to say, what they're going to think, and you play it out.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.800]   And he's playing it out in his mind.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   He's going to sit there and be like, "You don't know God.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.800]   What's his name? Huh?"
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.800]   It's almost like if he lied, like, "I've got this hot girlfriend."
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   It's like, "Oh yeah? What's her name?"
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   That's kind of what it's like.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.800]   And so he fears the people and their questioning.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   "They're going to question me. They're going to doubt me.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   And then I'm going to be on the stand. What am I going to say?"
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   And to this kind of fear, God answers.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   God said to Moses, "I am who I am."
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   And he said, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I am has sent me to you.'"
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.800]   I'm going to be honest, guys.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:56.800]   I don't know how to express the importance and the weight of this passage.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   I mean in my head, when I studied, it was just like mind-blowing.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   But I'm going to be honest. Try to put it into words.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.800]   It was just really hard.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.800]   And I'm going to say this. It's really hard.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   Because what is contained in God's statement, "I am who I am," is in one sense inexplicable.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   It's beyond us. Right?
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   So I want to give that preface.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.800]   I'm going to try my best to explain that passage to us.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   But that passage, in all that it contains, is inexplicable
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   because it is completely beyond our comprehension.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   Yet at the same time, God has given us mercy because he's revealed
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   the degree, to a certain degree, his nature contained in his name.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.800]   And I want to say, some people get so focused on this word, or this name, "I am who I am."
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:55.800]   But we realize that God is revealing himself in a greater fashion from verse 13 all the way down to verse 22.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   And so we have to consider all of that as we see God's revelation.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.800]   But I want to say this at first.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:06.800]   That this name is all of a sudden so important to us because God says, "This is my name to you."
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.800]   And then he says in verse 15, "This is my name forever."
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   And this is my memorial name to all generations.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   You think about that for a moment, right?
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   This is the way that God wants to be remembered.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.800]   Typically, when people say stuff like that, that's the kind of stuff they say on their deathbed.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   "Remember me as I am, and remember this picture of me," you know?
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.800]   But God, he's just simply introducing himself to Moses.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:41.800]   And he says, "For generations down to all your heritage, I want you to remember me like this."
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   And I want you to know that this name has been so sacred that the Jewish people dared not even pronounce it.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   They wouldn't even want to write it.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   And so a lot of times, they would give the symbols Y, H, W, H, but they would just leave out the vowels.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   So, truthfully speaking, there's been various renditions of this, but this name Yahweh,
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   which is derived from that statement, "I am who I am,"
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.800]   has been so cherished in all of history that people would dare not even write it.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.800]   And even in your Bibles, rather than just writing Y, H, W, H,
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   in your Bibles, what you see is you see a capitalization of the word Lord, L-O-R-D.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   And know that every time you read the Old Testament, you see that capital word.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.800]   It is his name, Yahweh.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   "I am who I am."
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.800]   But the first thing that we want to learn about, what that reveals about the nature of God,
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   it's his aseity, A-S-E-I-T-Y.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.800]   To tell you truthfully, it's hard for me to say the word, so that's the only time I'm going to say it.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   The best way to say it is his self-existence.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   It's his self-existence.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.800]   And you guys might have heard this before, you guys might have studied it already,
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   that this is one of the nature, like, attributes of God that is broad.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   We're not talking now about the depth of his love and how intricate it is and how sovereign it is.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   We're talking about a broad scope idea of his nature.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.800]   That God is Alpha Omega.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   That God is all in all.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.800]   That his being is completely on a separate level than us.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   We are beings to which we require fuel.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.800]   We are beings where we are dependent.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.800]   We are dependent on air, we're dependent on shelter, we're dependent on parents,
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.800]   we're dependent on just about everything.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.800]   Water, food, sustenance.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   God is a being to which he needs absolutely nothing.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:47.800]   He needs no sustenance and food and he needs no other material to feed him and he has nothing of that.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:51.800]   He is a God who is entirely self-existent.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.800]   But why, let me describe this to you in another way.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.800]   I'm going to get a little bit philosophical, okay?
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:07.800]   For vast majority of all of philosophy, your questions are circled around three main ideas.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   Here are the three.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   First, what is the origin of man?
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   What is the origin of things?
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   That's where philosophers would sit there and ruminate and they would philosophize with each other
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   and they would ask each other questions and the origin has to be traced back to this and there's a cause this
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.800]   and that's where a lot of philosophy happens.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.800]   There's another question.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   What is the nature of who I am now?
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   Who am I? What's my identity?
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   What's my makeup?
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   If you were to boil me down, what am I essentially?
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.800]   And some philosophers say, "You're just material. You're just flesh and you're just atoms and all this kind of stuff and that's it."
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   Other philosophers say, "No, you're a soul, you're a mind, you're a heart, you're all this kind of stuff."
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   Next question.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.800]   Where am I headed?
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   What is my destiny?
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   Right?
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.800]   Think about this for a moment.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   Those questions baffle mankind for all of history.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   Those questions sometimes spiral people down into a pit of despisement.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   Who am I? I don't know.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   Where am I from? To whom do I credit being here?
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.800]   Right?
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:15.800]   And then those questions that spiral a bunch of people into confusion, into being deceived.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   And then, these philosophers who had no idea how to answer those questions even for themselves, dared to ask that of God.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.800]   What's the source of God?
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.800]   Who created God?
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.800]   Who is the cause of God?
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   Our answer? Invalid question.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   Because God simply is.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   He has always been.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   He is now and He will continue to be because His existence is far beyond your imagination.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.800]   For example, there was a philosopher named Bertrand Russell who was a well-known philosopher.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:53.800]   He denied God and he was incredibly popular because he said, "I have a proof that God doesn't exist."
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   Because everything in this world needs a cause.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   Everything in this world has a reason for being.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.800]   Well, what's the reason for God?
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   There you go.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   There's no God.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   Everything has to have a cause.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   There is no God like the God you say who is eternal.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.800]   But then another philosopher named David Hume said this, "You silly guy.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:18.800]   The reason why you think everything has to have a cause is because of the poverty of your mind.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   You don't realize that your mind is poor and limited and like this."
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.800]   But God is a God who is eternal.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   He is the cause.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:34.800]   Everything that is in effect has a cause, yes, but He is the cause, the first cause and the only cause
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   to the degree that scriptures would say, "Right now, everything that exists owes its existence to God."
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   Everything that has movement and life owes its movement and its life to God.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.800]   And right now, it is God who sustains this life so that it doesn't completely ramble,
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.800]   so that it doesn't completely fall into utter destruction.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   Now, why am I going on about this, about this theological topic of God's self-existence?
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.800]   I mean, it's all head knowledge.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.800]   It's all like theory.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   Okay, I get it.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.800]   God is super high.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.800]   Let me make two points.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.800]   Number one, the reason why this matters.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   I am making the point that Moses does not see God as high as he ought to.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.800]   Can we all just admit that even if you've been growing and learning and you've been learning everything about God,
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.800]   God is so beyond us that even if you held a PhD simply on the attributes of God,
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.800]   you still do not know God as you ought to.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   You still do not know God and the reality of the majesty and the exaltation that He deserves.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   Because God is the great I Am.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.800]   And our mind, our mind is poverished.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.800]   We're limited.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   But number two, there is a perspective that comes from all this, and I just want to quote Jesus' words,
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   so please turn in your Bibles to the book of Luke.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:12.800]   Book of Luke, chapter 12, verse 4 through 7.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.800]   Book of Luke, chapter 12.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.800]   Jesus is teaching the masses.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   There are thousands of people around Him.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:24.800]   And He's going to talk about various things here, but He's going to really talk about God and His care.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:32.800]   In verse 4, He says, "I say to you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   But I will warn you whom to fear.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   Fear the one who after he has killed you has authority to cast into hell.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.800]   Yes, I tell you, fear Him."
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   Verse 6, "Are not five sparrows sold for two cents, yet not one of them is forgotten before God?
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   Do not fear, you are more valuable than many sparrows."
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   Let me ask you this question.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.800]   In Jesus' eyes, what is the solution for everyday fear?
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   Fear that people might persecute me.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.800]   Fear that I might not have enough food.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   Fear that I might die.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:14.800]   In Jesus' encouragement to the people and the masses of that time, what is His solution?
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   Look at how scary God is.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   Look at how majestic, how powerful, how transcendent.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   Look at this God who is the I Am, who has absolute control over you because He made you.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   Because He has absolute authority over you.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.800]   And that by His will, He can do whatever He desires with you.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   Fear Him.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.800]   And that is the lesson that Moses needed to hear.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:48.800]   He feared everything about himself and the other people, but the challenge is fear God, this God who is the I Am.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   The self-existent God.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   So I want to highlight for you, when you think about the self-existent God, don't think like, "Okay, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo."
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   Like He's out in heaven and some transcendent being who's just like, "There."
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.800]   How much power.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   How much power must an individual, if you really saw him as a person, how much power would this person have where he has no limitation,
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   he needs no fuel, no sustenance, no nothing.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   He is absolutely independent and whenever he desires to do anything, he can because he is.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.800]   You know, recently I saw this one movie trailer.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.800]   I don't like to talk too much about movies because some of the movies are bad.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.800]   But I saw this movie trailer about the X-Men apocalypse.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.800]   Have you seen that trailer?
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   Seems like it's going to be a really good action-packed movie.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:45.800]   But I saw this trailer and there is this being, the apocalypse.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:54.800]   And supposedly he existed from long, long time ago in the days of Egypt, when they had the pyramids and stuff, when they had the pharaohs and stuff.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.800]   And then these people who are like, "Oh, who is this guy?"
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:04.800]   And in the movie there is this scene where they are like, "Oh, there is this written about this being who is going to come and he has four horsemen."
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.800]   And then one of the people go, "Oh, he got that from the Bible."
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   And another person goes, "Maybe the Bible got it from him."
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   And I'm like, "What?!"
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   Awful, you know.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   And then the trailer continues. So you guys know what trailer I'm talking about, right?
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   And then the trailer continues and then it says there is this being.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.800]   And then Professor Xavier, he is sitting there with his eyes all buggy and watering.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   He is like, "I've never felt such power!"
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   And I'm going to be honest, I sat there and I'm like, "Oh my gosh."
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.800]   I felt really offended. I felt really offended.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   And I don't want to overly spiritualize for everything, every movie I see, but this is the best that the world can imagine about power.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:57.800]   The scripture is saying God has such power that literally every single one of our lives would disintegrate if God chose so.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   But not only in this lifetime, but for all eternity, God has authority over you because He is the great I Am.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.800]   That He could cast you into hell and judge you.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   That He could send you to heaven and give you all of the inheritance of the kingdom.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.800]   But this is the Almighty God who can do as He pleases.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   He is self-existence and there is nothing that anybody can contribute to Him because He is the I Am.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   This is our God.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   And our challenge is to have a view of Him like that.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.800]   To see Him like that.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   And Apostle Paul would have the same challenge with the people of his day.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:42.800]   If you go over to the book of Acts chapter 17, Apostle Paul is going through preaching and he's in Athens.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   And he comes across a bunch of people.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:52.800]   He exhibits the same questions that you guys would experience in your religious studies class, in your philosophy classes about God.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   Who is God? What is God? Where are we? Who are we? All this kind of stuff.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:04.800]   And in chapter 17, if you go over to, let's see here, I lost my place, verse 23.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   Chapter 17 verse 23, this is what Apostle Paul says.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.800]   Let me just start in verse 22.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   So Paul stood in the midst of Heropagus and said, "Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.800]   To an unknown God.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   Therefore, what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:39.800]   The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is the Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands."
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   He's talking about the existence and being and nature of God.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:48.800]   Verse 25, "Nor is He served by human hands as though He needed anything."
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   That's my point.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   God needs absolutely nothing. He is self-existent. He is the great I am.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:01.800]   He says, "He needs nothing since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   And He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their inhabitation.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:18.800]   That they would seek God if perhaps by might, that they might grow for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   For in Him we live and move and exist."
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.800]   That was Apostle Paul's preaching.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:33.800]   He says, "This is the God. You worship this unknown God and you put Him in a temple and you make Him essentially.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   But God is exalted and He is beyond your imagination."
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   And later he's going to say, "So therefore, repent. Therefore, repent."
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.800]   So indeed, God is exalted and that is the way God wanted to reveal Himself to the nations.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.800]   This is the way God wants all the generations to remember Him.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.800]   The problem is, fear is irrational.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   Right? That's what I started with.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   And what we're going to see now is the irrational fear then of Moses continuing to make excuse after God has revealed Himself in this fashion.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   So let's move forward to chapter 4, verse 1.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.800]   So jump back to Exodus, okay?
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   Chapter 3. Or chapter 4.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   Jump back to Exodus chapter 4.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   And go to verse 1.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:29.800]   So Moses says, "What if they don't believe me or listen to what I say?
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.800]   For they may say, 'The Lord has not appeared to you.'"
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   Do you see his fear?
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.800]   His fear is failure.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.800]   His fear is failure.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   Okay, you know, God just laid out the game plan.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   He just said, "Okay, this is what's going to happen.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.800]   I'm going to send you. You're going to say this kind of stuff.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   And then you're going to talk to these people.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.800]   And then the Pharaoh is going to not listen to you.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   He's going to resist you.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.800]   But then you're going to come out with all their spoils.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   And then you're going to worship.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.800]   And you're going to be right here."
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   God just laid out the entire game plan.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   And Moses' next question is, "But what if they don't listen?"
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   Essentially what he's saying is, "It's not going to work.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   But Father, but God, it's not going to work."
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   And he has this fear of failure.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.800]   He has this fear of it not going right.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.800]   Look what God does in response.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:25.800]   God, in verse 2, "And the Lord said to him, 'What's that in your hand?'"
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.800]   And I love the way God talks to him.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   God is so wise and so poignant.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   "What's that in your hand?"
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   And Moses says, "A staff."
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   Then he said, "Throw it on the ground."
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent, a snake.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.800]   Imagine that.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   Here's Moses, "It's not going to work. And it's all going to fail.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.800]   And they're not going to listen."
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   And God says, "Take that stick. Throw it on the ground."
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.800]   He's like, "Whoa!"
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   "Grab it by the tail."
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   He grabs it by the tail and back to a stick.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   "Whoa!"
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   God says, "Put your hand in your shirt."
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   "Okay."
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.800]   He takes it out, and it's like leprosy.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   So he says, "Why does it snow?"
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.800]   It's scaly.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.800]   Leprosy is a disease of the nervous system and the skin.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.800]   The skin decays, and the nervous system gets desensitized.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.800]   And so your skin is like infected and all this kind of stuff.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   And he's like, "Ahh! Put it back in your shirt."
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.800]   It's normal again.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.800]   And then lastly, God says, "If they still don't believe you, take some water."
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   So he takes some water, spills it on the ground.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   It's blood.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:29.800]   God does three miracles to show Moses God's power.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   Now, you might be thinking, "Okay, so what God is saying is, 'Moses, calm down.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   I have things in control, and it's going to be successful.'"
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.800]   But that's actually not the reason why God is doing those miracles.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.800]   If you look as to why God is doing those miracles, look at verse 5.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   "That they may believe that the Lord, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham,
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, has appeared to you."
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   It's going back to this idea and perspective.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   You see, Moses is sitting here thinking, "It's not going to work.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   I can't do it."
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   But then God essentially puts on the training wheels and says,
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   "Okay, I want you to follow with me here and obey me.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   Throw the stick on the ground."
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   Is that miraculous?
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.800]   Just taking a stick and going, "Ugh."
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.800]   Is that so hard?
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   No.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   It's anything anybody can do.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   God didn't ask Moses to turn it into a snake.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   God did.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   God told Moses to put his hand in his shirt.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   Is that hard?
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   I just did it.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   Am I a leader now because I did this?
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.800]   No.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   It's nothing.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   This is nothing.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   But God didn't ask Moses to make his hand heal again,
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.800]   but that's what Moses is kind of thinking.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.800]   God didn't ask Moses to turn water into blood.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.800]   God just told him to spill the water.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   It's coming back to that same perspective.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.800]   You have to realize God is with you.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   You have to realize God is the one who is powerful,
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   and your confidence is not in yourself.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:09.800]   However, what's revealing is when you take what is God's responsibility and his power,
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   and then you take it and you look at it,
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   and you go, "It's not going to work."
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   What does that say about your perspective of yourself?
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   Let me say it again.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   When you take the thing that belongs to God,
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   you evaluate it, and you think, "That's not going to work."
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.800]   What does that say about your view of yourself?
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   Your view of yourself and the perspective that you have cannot confuse what is God's and what is yours.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   What was being revealed through these signs was the fact that God was there.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.800]   God had appeared to Moses, and God was with Moses.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.800]   That needed to be evident and clear,
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.800]   and Moses is the first person who needs to learn it.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   So do you and I.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:58.800]   We have to graduate from the kind of belief and trust in God
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   that only trusts when God lays everything out,
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   and God shows you it's going to be okay,
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   and God gives you the power,
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   and God gives you everything,
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   all the resources, and there's zero risk,
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.800]   and then now I'll trust you.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   We need to graduate from that and say,
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   not because of what you've done,
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   or because of all the things you give me,
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   but because of who you are as the great I am,
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   I trust you, and I will obey.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   God is training Moses through that with these signs.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   God is training him.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:38.800]   But unfortunately, Moses, although he's being shown the ropes,
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.800]   he still feels this inadequacy,
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.800]   and in verse 10, Moses says to the Lord,
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   "Please, Lord, I mean we've been going at this for some time.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.800]   I have never been eloquent, neither recently nor in the past time,
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.800]   nor since you have spoken to your servant,
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.800]   And Moses is reiterating this idea.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   Remember I said fear is irrational, it's scriptural.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.800]   I can't, I can't, I can't.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.800]   That's what he's saying.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.800]   I can't.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   And I'm going to tell you honestly,
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   I've heard that a lot.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   When I'm counseling people,
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.800]   "Hey, I want you to go and talk to that person and reconcile."
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.800]   I can't.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   "I want you to take a step out in faith and do this thing.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   I know it's going to be embarrassing."
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   I can't.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.800]   That's just not me.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   No.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   Right?
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:31.800]   You do realize that although, yes,
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   sometimes it's good to know your limitation.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   So let me give you a caveat.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.800]   I hope you guys aren't thinking like this is a sermon about,
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.800]   "Yes, we can, and with God, anything is possible."
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.800]   And then our softball team goes, "Yeah, we can win."
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   You know?
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.800]   We'll just see about that, okay?
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   This is not a promise that you can do anything and everything in your life.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.800]   Some of our ambitions are ridiculous, and we just can't do it.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   But there are things that God has clearly defined as his will for you.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   There are things that God has given to you as a mandate for you.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   There are things that God expects you to simply follow and obey.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.800]   The proclamation of your faith.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.800]   I'm going to get real specific.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.800]   Some of you, you don't want to get baptized
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.800]   because you don't want to be up here talking like this.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.800]   And it's frightening.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.800]   It's deadly frightening.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   I understand that.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   I'm still scared of public speaking, believe it or not.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   Some of you don't want to proclaim your faith to your family member for the fear.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.800]   Some of you don't want to do various things.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   Join membership.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   Some of you don't want to do this.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   Commit to that.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   Commit to this.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.800]   Like devote yourself to X, Y, and Z.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.800]   Because you're afraid.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   Okay?
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   Realize that when it comes to those things,
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   it's not humble to keep second guessing yourself.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:49.800]   Because ultimately, God never asked you to rely on yourself anyway.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   And so scriptures teaches us in 2 Corinthians 3, verse 4 through 6,
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   such confidence we have through Christ towards God,
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves,
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   but our adequacy is from God,
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   who has made us adequate as servants of a new covenant.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.800]   And to keep going against God's adequacy is to keep questioning God,
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.800]   and God gets frustrated at that.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.800]   And you keep testing God's patience.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:21.800]   And all that becomes is not so much a humble exercise in trying to see whether I'm fit for this or not,
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   it becomes a questioning and an excuse making of why not to obey.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.800]   And again, I'm not talking about like leadership,
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.800]   and I'm not talking about various other like ambitions we have.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   I'm talking about the general Christian call for you to be faithful and committed,
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   and to carry out and fulfill the things God has called you to.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:47.800]   To those things, you can't make excuse.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   What you need to do is trust God.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.800]   What you need to do is have confidence.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:58.800]   God is mighty, and what He's called me to do, He will amply supply.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:04.800]   What's unfortunate, or actually, we want to go forward to look at God's reaction to this.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.800]   In verse 11 it says, "The Lord said to him, 'Who has made man's mouth, Moses?
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.800]   Or who makes him mute or deaf, or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.800]   Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth,
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   and teach you what you say, or what you are to say.'"
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.800]   And God reiterates this fact, "I am your creator.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.800]   I made your mouth. I made you."
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:35.800]   So if you are prone to make this excuse, like, "I can't go on missions, that's not me."
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.800]   Okay, maybe, you know, it's wise, you consider it's not the opportune time,
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.800]   you have to focus on other things, great.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.800]   But if your excuse is, "That's just not me."
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.800]   Really?
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.800]   So God made you to not do missions?
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.800]   God made you not to evangelize?
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.800]   I think that "me" you're talking about is the old you, the dead you,
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   the one that needs to die even more.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.800]   Let's not use those excuses.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.800]   "I can, it's not me."
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.800]   God says, "I made you."
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.800]   Right? "I made you."
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   And so we need to obey, even in the small steps,
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.800]   even if we don't get the picture, even if we don't feel like it's natural.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   That's okay if it doesn't feel like it's natural.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.800]   It's okay if sometimes we feel inadequate.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:21.800]   That's just life, all around.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:26.800]   But unfortunately, to God's encouragement and to everything that God's been saying to him,
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   Moses responds with saying in verse 13,
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:35.800]   "Please, Lord, now send a message by whomever you will."
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   It's a weird way of saying it.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   I don't know why he put it into those words.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   "Send a message by whomever you will."
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.800]   You know what he's saying, right?
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.800]   Just pick some other guy, you know.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   Can't somebody else do this?
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.800]   Can't somebody else do this?
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   I bet you he's probably thinking, "Can't you do this?"
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   What's really interesting about the word of "Please, Lord," is it says, "Send a message."
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   The reason why it says it like that is because "deliver by hand the message," right?
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.800]   It's almost like saying, "Just do it yourself."
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:11.800]   "You came down, you heard, you're powerful, you're worthy, I am. Just do it."
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:15.800]   "Why do you got to involve me into this?" Right?
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.800]   What I realized at that point is there's something more into his heart.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.800]   Fear has gripped him to the point where there is actually no excuse.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.800]   There's no good excuse.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   God Almighty reveals himself to you in a bush.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:32.800]   He speaks to you, he encourages you, he tells you he's with you, he says, "I'm going to give you the exact words you're going to say."
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   And then you say, "What excuse do you have?"
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.800]   What is revealed here is he's simply not willing.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.800]   He's just not willing.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.800]   And so I want to encourage our hearts today.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.800]   If there is any level of fear in your heart, any level of discouragement,
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:56.800]   whether it's external, internal, whether it's fear of yourself, fear of your own failure, fear of other people,
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.800]   I relate to all of that, all of those things.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   I'm a people pleaser.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   I have fear of man in me.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.800]   I have various things and I experience all of that.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.800]   How do we combat that? That's the question today.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.800]   How do we combat those fears?
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.800]   If you're like me, it's typically, "Well, I'm just going to improve on that level."
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   If I'm fear of speaking, I'm going to take a speech class.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   I took a speech class, okay?
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   If I fear this, I'm going to do this.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   If I fear that, I'm going to do this.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.800]   And what you do is you're going to, "I'm going to gear up.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.800]   I'm going to armor up and suit up.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.800]   I'm going to tackle this thing."
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.800]   That is not God's encouragement here.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.800]   That is typically not God's encouragement anywhere.
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.800]   Your fear needs to be overcome with a greater fear.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.800]   And that greater fear comes from an appropriate view of God.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   So I want to challenge us that as we see the interaction between Moses and God,
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.800]   what has God been teaching you through this two-part sermon?
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:56.800]   God has been teaching us that God is absolutely sovereign even when it's invisible.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   God has been teaching us that God is absolutely near and He is involved intimately.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:06.800]   He's been teaching us He is wholly beyond measure to the degree that the advice to this man, Moses,
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   who is the man, was, "Don't you dare come close."
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   We've been learning God is transcendent.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.800]   He is beyond what we can imagine in existence and being.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.800]   But we also learn that God is absolutely patient.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.800]   He is loving with us.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.800]   He is patient with us.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:29.800]   And all of this that we're learning about God needs to now translate into trust, into confidence.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.800]   And I truly believe, and I'm going to say it again, every time we have anxiety,
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   every time we have a sense of, "Woe is me," a pitying of the self, a discouragement so that we're not obeying God,
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   we've lost a sight of confidence in God who is the I Am.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:52.800]   So I want to encourage us today that with all of this we want to respond with,
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:58.800]   "Lord, although I might understand, I trust You. You're with me."
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:05.800]   I want to encourage you by leaving you with not on a sad note that Moses was stubborn and he was all, you know, excuses, excuses.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:16.800]   Turn your Bible to Chapter 15 after the Exodus, after the Great Ten Plagues, after, you know, all this stuff.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:21.800]   Moses is able to sing something quite beautiful.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.800]   And I just want to say, or I just want to read this for you guys.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   It's a little lengthy, so follow with me here, verse 1 through 11.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:35.800]   "Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the Lord and said, 'I will sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea. The Lord is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.800]   This is my God, and I will praise Him. My Father is God, and I will extol Him.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.800]   The Lord is a warrior. The Lord is His name.'"
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:50:00.800]   Wow. Let's keep going. "Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has cast into the sea, and the choices of his officers he has drowned into the Red Sea.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   The deeps cover them. They went down into the depths like a stone.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:10.800]   Your right hand, O Lord, is majestic in power. Your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemies.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.800]   In the greatness of Your excellence, You overthrow those who rise up against You.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:18.800]   You send forth Your burning anger, and it consumes us chaff.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.800]   At the blast of Your nostrils, the waters are piled up.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.800]   The flowing waters stood up like a heap, and the deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   The enemy said, 'I'll pursue. I'll overtake. I'll divide and spoil.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:36.800]   My desire shall be gratified against them, and I will draw out my sword by the hand and will destroy them.'
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   But You blew with Your wind, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:55.800]   Who is like You among the gods, O Lord? Who is like You, majestic in holiness, awesome in praises, working wonders?"
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:03.800]   I think it's awesome that after Moses went through that struggle of making excuses and excuses,
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:09.800]   in the end he relented and he took his wife and son, and he made his trek.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:18.800]   And simply by taking that small step of obedience, Moses was able to see something wonderful and be convinced of something amazing.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:24.800]   Moses is now convinced, "My God is mighty and great in His name, and nobody like it.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   Although there is this great nation like the Pharaohs, they're crushed. They go down to the sea like a stone.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.800]   There is nothing that stands in the way of our God."
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   Let's have that kind of trust and confidence in everyday approach to our spiritual lives. Amen. Let's pray.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:43.800]   Hope you enjoyed the video.
