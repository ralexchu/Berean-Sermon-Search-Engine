[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   God, as cluttered as our minds and hearts can be,
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.440]   as many things as has been occurring in our lives,
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.660]   I pray, Father, that our view of you
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.180]   would be clear tonight as we pray.
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.520]   Father, cause us to understand and cause us to see,
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.180]   Lord, that our prayers would be pure and motive,
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.460]   God, that our desires would really be to accomplish yours.
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.660]   And so thank you, God, and as we sing
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.640]   and as we pray to you, we pray that you'd be honored
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.800]   in Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.860]   All right, well, tonight, before we go into the first song,
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.860]   I'm going to be asking our AV to be putting up
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.640]   Psalm chapter 90.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.000]   And for a good, like, maybe about five minutes or so,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.800]   it's kind of, well, it's more text
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.840]   than we might be kind of comfortable with reading,
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.360]   but we're just gonna leave it up there
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.040]   for about five minutes for you to read through it,
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.720]   to meditate, to pray, and then after about five minutes,
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.760]   the praise team's going to be taking us
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.640]   into singing our first song.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.320]   We're gonna be singing two songs after that,
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.300]   and I'll be coming up and then taking us
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.480]   into the teaching portion of tonight.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.240]   So if you can, for now, just go ahead,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.180]   as the praise team's gonna be playing some music for us
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.400]   to read through this psalm and to meditate on it
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.360]   and to take some time to pray on your own,
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.800]   and then we'll sing together.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.880]   (gentle piano music)
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.960]   (gentle piano music)
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.040]   (gentle piano music)

[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.340]   (gentle piano music)

[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:42.580]   (gentle piano music)
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.660]   (gentle piano music)
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:04:01.620]   (gentle piano music)
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.700]   (gentle piano music)
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:21.640]   (gentle piano music)
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.720]   (gentle piano music)
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:39.680]   (gentle piano music)
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:48.200]   Church, may we let us stand together
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.280]   as we sing together from Upper Alaska.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.920]   (gentle piano music)

[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:26.160]   Well, as we sing songs, it gets very easy
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.880]   to kind of come in and out of songs,
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.960]   and it's very, it's actually a lot simpler, I think,
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.720]   to come to a place where we feel emotionally worshipful
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.000]   when we're singing, and I believe with all my heart
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.440]   that that is a means that God has given to us
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.920]   in order to worship him, but as we sing songs like this,
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.640]   even those short words that we sing at the end there,
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.960]   Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name,
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.680]   what we ought to be able to see very clearly in our lives
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.480]   is that it's very easy to sing those words,
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.480]   and it's very difficult sometimes to live out those words
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.000]   or to believe those words.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.120]   In the scriptures, it says,
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.400]   "Out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks,"
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.640]   and we can very easily sing these songs,
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.360]   and our lips can be saying these truths
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.160]   that we do agree along with,
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.680]   but our lives become a testimony
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.400]   as to what it is that we truly mean,
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.240]   what it is that we truly believe.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.620]   I wanna ask today, is that something that we believe,
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.180]   that with our lives, if the people around us
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.680]   were to be able to say something
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.620]   about the quality of our lives, the testimony that we show,
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:49.260]   the way that we live, has it been worthy of God?
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.120]   Has it been something that would be worshipful towards God,
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.920]   that when we say that Jesus' name is worthy,
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.040]   that our lives begin to preach such a truth
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.880]   to all those that are around us?
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.260]   Today, we're gonna be going into 1 Corinthians 1:18,
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.720]   and from here, I wanted to delve a little bit into this,
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.200]   this thought of what we believe,
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.000]   and it says in verse 18 through 21,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.960]   "For the word of the cross is foolishness
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.520]   "to those who are perishing,
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.960]   "but to us who are being saved,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   "that is the power of God, for it is written,
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.900]   "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.800]   "and the cleverness of the clever, I will set aside."
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.440]   Where is the wise man?
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.400]   Where is the scribe?
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.880]   Where is the debater of this age?
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.680]   Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.160]   For since in the wisdom of God,
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.960]   the world, through its wisdom, did not come to know God,
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.040]   God was well-pleased through the foolishness
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.680]   of the message preached to save those who believe.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.280]   If you look very carefully in verse 18 there,
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.280]   it says, "The word of the cross is foolishness
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.800]   "to those who are perishing,
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.280]   "but to us who are being saved, that is the power of God."
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.840]   So what we have common in this verse is the word of God.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.760]   The word of God, this theological truth,
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.640]   is the exact same one given to both the ones
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.340]   who are perishing and to the ones who are being saved.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:20.000]   And yet, what it produces at the end of that
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.880]   is so starkly different.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.600]   So the difference here is going to be
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.400]   that to a perishing people,
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:32.040]   it's going to be almost this stench of death,
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.480]   and to those who are being saved, it is the word of life.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:41.900]   Though it's being presented to two people,
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.440]   this idea of this being the power of God
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.520]   is going to be seen in how one responds to such a truth.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.520]   And so there is going to be this wise man, this scribe.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.280]   There are gonna be people who are very, very smart
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.600]   and intelligent, and even the way that this passage
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.380]   kind of starts to break it down,
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.200]   it's not just like intelligence with the mind,
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.280]   but there's also this spiritually intelligent part
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.760]   that is being kind of touched upon
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.680]   when he begins to talk about not just wisdom,
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.540]   but when someone asks for science.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.160]   In this passage, these two paths
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.800]   might seem so similar to each other
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.360]   because the word of God is the same,
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.120]   but these are polar opposites.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.880]   And where the word of God goes forth,
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.280]   what it does is it destroys the wisdom of the wise.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.540]   So whatever seems wise, it's going to break that.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:43.240]   Whatever is clever in the sight of the worldly,
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.480]   it's going to break that.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.600]   And so as heavenly people,
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.400]   if we're Christians praying to God tonight,
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.640]   then we don't come with a worldly wisdom,
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.240]   we come with a heavenly wisdom.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.400]   We don't come with worldly, earthly sight,
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.020]   we come with heavenly sight, godly sight, spiritual sight.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:07.560]   We don't pray like fleshly, we pray spiritually
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.500]   because that's the difference between us and the world.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.680]   Between the believing and the unbelieving.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.140]   And so when we think about it,
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.340]   we have to be very careful
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.700]   because we think that inherently, because we're believers,
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.700]   the things that we pray, what we believe
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.060]   is going to just simply be exactly what is honoring to God,
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.700]   and we know that that's not true.
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.380]   We know how prone we are to jump over that
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.500]   back into a fleshly way of thinking,
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.940]   back into a fleshly way of asking,
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.700]   fleshly way of praying,
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.980]   fleshly way of tackling our problems,
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.940]   our fleshly way of just seeing our lives.
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.620]   And we have to come back to this place
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.360]   where what we believe begins to match how we live.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:02.300]   I want to take this time to think about our prayers today
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.780]   because it's quite possible for us
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.660]   to fill the next amount of time in prayer
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.900]   with earthly prayers.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.080]   Filled with earthly wisdom and earthly cleverness.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.440]   And many times, it's not just intelligence,
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.820]   but it's spiritual intelligence.
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.060]   Many times, we've figured out
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.140]   how to use the spiritual talk and the religious talk.
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:30.980]   We take a quick step back and we know,
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.780]   we can see how we've been living our lives.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.940]   And my hope is that tonight we're making sure
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.340]   we're taking the examining time
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.340]   to look inside of our hearts and see.
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:52.740]   Even religiosity that's just fleshliness guised
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.480]   and just spiritual talk and spiritual thought,
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.560]   it can be filled with earnestness.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.040]   Religiosity can be filled with tears,
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.120]   fervor, and even a lot of desire.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.200]   I remember when I was in college,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.600]   there was a Mormon who came
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.360]   and was evangelizing at our door.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.080]   We invited them in and I was shocked at how fervent,
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.580]   how earnest this individual was.
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.920]   With tears, she was pleading with me
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.480]   to place my faith in this God.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:34.000]   And I was shocked because that earnestness
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.720]   was based off of a lie.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.380]   When we look at even the Corinthian church,
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.980]   we see that, right?
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.060]   How could a church that is so filled,
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.760]   most of us are aware of the Corinthian church.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.000]   It was filled with the most filthy of sins,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.720]   the most abomination of sins, right?
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.780]   It was so crazy what they were doing inside of this church.
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:03.760]   If any of that was found here in our church,
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.520]   it would be shocking, it would be so scandalous.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.020]   This was a church filled with such fleshliness.
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.860]   So what gets so disturbing
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.800]   is when we get to these portions in 1 Corinthians
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.160]   where we see them to be exercising spiritual gifts, right?
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.760]   That they're speaking in tongues.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:33.940]   That they're probably singing loud songs of praise,
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.780]   praying very, very loudly.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.680]   Trying to do things that were very spiritual.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.180]   It's not that they were just trying to be fleshly.
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:49.440]   And so I wanted to bring that to our awareness today.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.640]   In James chapter three, it says that worldly wisdom
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.620]   is earthly, natural, and demonic.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.120]   But it says wisdom from above
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.200]   is something that we must pray for, ask God for,
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.040]   because he promises to give it abundantly
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.540]   and without approach to us.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.420]   And so 1 Corinthians continues in chapter one, verse 22,
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.100]   for indeed, Jews ask for signs
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.300]   and Greeks search for wisdom,
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.060]   but we preach Christ crucified.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.740]   To Jews, a stumbling block, and to Gentiles, foolishness,
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.740]   but to us who are being called, or who are the called,
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.860]   both Jews and Greeks, Christ,
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.520]   the power of God and the wisdom of God,
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.060]   because the foolishness of God is wiser than men,
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.320]   and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.820]   And so you see two sets of people here,
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.060]   the Jews who are asking for the spiritual,
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.580]   for these signs to be shown,
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.200]   these Greeks who are asking for the intelligent,
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.880]   the wisdom, the strategies, and the philosophies,
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.580]   but he says we don't go to any of these,
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.220]   we simply preach Christ crucified.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.460]   And it's not just a better path,
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.180]   it's that this is in stark contrast.
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.480]   It actually causes the Jews
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.260]   for this to become a stumbling block,
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.160]   and to the Gentiles for this to become foolishness.
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.900]   But for us who are Christians, it's the power of God.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.020]   The wisdom of God looks so differently.
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.860]   And so ask yourself that question today.
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.840]   But we can be so religious in our thought,
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.220]   we can be so thinking of our service,
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.740]   and what it is that we're going to be doing tonight,
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.140]   we have to be careful,
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.940]   because our prayers can be so fleshly.
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:25.440]   And much of that is going to happen,
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.620]   the danger is going to happen is we have not been praying.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.860]   And we come to a place tonight
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.740]   where tonight looks so different
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.420]   than how the rest of our lives has been
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.340]   for the last week, month, months.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:47.280]   And the more earnest and fervent we become tonight,
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.940]   we have to ask ourselves, is this truly what we believe?
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:56.000]   Is this what we want?
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.540]   Do we want what's honoring to God?
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:05.180]   Because if we don't come into this examining place
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.740]   where we're thinking about why it is that we're here,
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.580]   and checking our motives,
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.700]   and contemplating what it is that we're actually asking for,
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.700]   then our spirituality is going to be incredibly fleshly.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:22.040]   And so what we pray for is going to be compromised.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.660]   So ask that tonight.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.340]   What is it that we're asking for?
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.220]   What do we expect from God?
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:36.220]   Do you really want what God wants?
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.860]   Because if that's what our prayers are going to be tonight,
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.420]   that that's why we're praying to God,
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.980]   because we want what God wants,
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.660]   His kingdom come, His will be done,
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:50.060]   then our lives need to already be reflecting that.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:55.220]   So we need to come tonight and surrender.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.900]   Because if our lives aren't reflecting God's kingdom come,
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.140]   God's will be done.
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.740]   God, my time is your time.
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.300]   My money is your money.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.460]   My energy is your energy.
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.620]   Everything about my life already belongs to you.
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.340]   If that's not set in stone,
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.140]   then everything we pray is going to be about me tonight.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.740]   It's not gonna be for God.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.860]   It's not gonna be for His kingdom.
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.220]   We're going to try to dress it up
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.620]   as spiritually as possible,
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.260]   but then we're going to go right back
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.260]   into what it is that we truly believe,
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.180]   what it is that we truly want.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.140]   And so surrender needs to happen first.
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.540]   And that's why many times during praise and prayer,
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.300]   we start the first part of it by surrendering,
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.220]   by repenting,
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:43.660]   by saying, "God, I can't give you prayer requests,
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.620]   "asking you to do this and to do that
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:48.380]   "when I'm not ready to even give up my own life."
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:56.340]   James says that we ask and we do not receive
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.340]   because we ask with wrong motives.
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:02.500]   We ask so that we might spend it on our own pleasures.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:08.460]   So the answer that's given in 1 Corinthians here,
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:12.100]   what makes believers so different is actually Christ.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.100]   It's our desire for Christ.
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:20.500]   In 1 Corinthians 2, verse one, it says,
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.780]   "And when I came to you, brethren,
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.740]   "I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom,
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.220]   "proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.340]   "For I determined to know nothing among you
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.580]   "except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.420]   "I was with you in weakness and in fear
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.380]   "and in much trembling, and my message and my preaching
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.620]   "were not in persuasive words of wisdom,
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.380]   "but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.380]   "so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men,
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.380]   "but on the power of God."
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:52.820]   Christ is actually actively the answer to all our prayers.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.540]   The cross is the answer
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.980]   to circumstantial difficulties in our lives.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.660]   He's the answer to disease and death around us.
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.300]   He's the answer to political turmoil that we see around us.
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.340]   Jesus is going to be the answer
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.580]   to our difficult children sometimes,
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.300]   to every frustration that we have in our lives,
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.340]   to our depression, to our anxieties, to our loneliness.
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.220]   He is going to be the answer to the sin
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.060]   that we're wrestling with inside.
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.060]   There is going to be no sign that can be given.
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.420]   There's going to be no wisdom that can be given to us
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.660]   that is greater than Christ,
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.500]   and so that's why it's so necessary for us
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:37.100]   to get to this place where we're singularly in tune with God,
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.180]   in line with God, in step with God.
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.420]   Otherwise, our prayers are going to be asking
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.140]   for fleshly things, guised in spirituality.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:50.860]   Much of our prayer is just going to be Christ.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.060]   Much of it, in the process of prayer,
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.780]   many things will resolve.
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.340]   Many things will heal in the process of our prayers.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:04.420]   We might think that there are other books to read,
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.020]   that there's counsel to receive,
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.620]   but at the end of the day, no matter how much
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.660]   we try to get around it,
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.580]   Jesus Christ is the only answer we have,
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.220]   and that's why in 1 Corinthians,
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.580]   he brings us to that point.
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.900]   And so, to conclude in this last part,
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.140]   in 1 Corinthians 2, verse 10, it says,
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.780]   "For to us, God revealed them through the Spirit.
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.620]   "For the Spirit searches all things,
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.540]   "even the depths of God.
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.740]   "For who among men knows the thoughts of a man
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.980]   "except the spirit of the man which is in him?
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.460]   "Even so, the thoughts of God,
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.700]   "no one knows except the Spirit of God.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.860]   "Now we have received, not the spirit of the world,
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.540]   "but the Spirit who is from God,
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.980]   "so that we may know the things freely given to us by God,
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.780]   "which things we also speak,
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.580]   "not in words taught by human wisdom,
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.180]   "but in those taught by the Spirit,
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.100]   "combining spiritual thoughts and spiritual words."
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:59.000]   And so, as we pray, ask God for his wisdom.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.020]   Look at your situations and circumstances today,
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:09.220]   and try to look at it the way God would look at it.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:13.940]   Ask yourself, what is the best possible way
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.460]   God can actually answer this prayer?
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.580]   If Christ is missing from it,
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.100]   let's reorient our thinking and go into it,
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.100]   truly understanding what it means
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.780]   to come into alignment with God's will,
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.060]   so that when we come to God,
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.360]   we're coming as people who are yearning to live,
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.740]   to think, to breathe, to behave as people,
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:41.500]   honest in our prayers with your kingdom come,
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.420]   your will be done.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.740]   And so, we're going to start with 20 minutes of surrender,
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.820]   and we're trying to be thorough.
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:54.380]   And so, we're going to put up two different slides here.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.740]   I know it's a little small,
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.420]   and so, it's going to get smaller.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.220]   So, if you can't see this,
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.540]   you won't be able to see the next one.
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.780]   I'm really sorry.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:04.860]   I should have made it bigger.
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.420]   I keep forgetting that.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.300]   But you are totally free in the process of prayer
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.540]   to come right up.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.980]   There's plenty of seats in the front.
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.540]   But as we pray,
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.860]   we're going to be going through some of these prayers
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.460]   for about 20 minutes.
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.660]   First one here are general sins to confess.
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.060]   It's just going to be an open thing.
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.740]   What sins have I committed?
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.060]   What sins have I stopped struggling with?
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:33.020]   And examine your own heart.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.580]   But we get a little bit more specific here.
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.700]   Places I have not been self-controlled.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.660]   Ask yourself that.
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.460]   That's a helpful place to begin.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.260]   Where have I not been self-controlled?
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.140]   To find your idolatries.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.380]   You can find it in those places
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.740]   where you're not self-controlled.
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.620]   Where have you been wasting your time?
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.420]   On entertainment, video games, web browsing,
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.460]   political news, fantasizing.
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.500]   Where have you been wasting money?
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.100]   Thoughts of eating out, online shopping,
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:05.380]   gadgets, collecting, materialism.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.900]   Where have you been wasting energy
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.180]   in your hobbies and your laziness?
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.140]   What about places of deceit in my life?
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.900]   Where have we been deceitful?
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.460]   Where have we been deceiving others?
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.820]   Where have we been self-deceived?
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.220]   Pray, meditate, think about these things.
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.940]   Have you been hiding something?
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.900]   Have you been living duplicitously, two-faced,
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.580]   not being the same in the inner man and the outer man?
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.460]   Ask yourselves about your purity issues.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.980]   Pray in these places.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.820]   Pray for a greater result to fight
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.420]   and to depend on the Spirit.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.700]   Where have I not been a person of my word?
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.500]   Think about your anxieties
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.700]   in your future in general, career,
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.100]   in your education and success
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.340]   and desire to climb the ranks to make more money.
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:59.460]   Anxieties about relationship status.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.020]   Anxieties about our children
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.140]   or our ability to have children.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.580]   Anxieties about our health.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.900]   What about things that you've been grumbling about?
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:14.540]   Have we been generally grumbling in our hearts?
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.940]   Grumbling about our jobs,
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:20.340]   about our income, our financial situation,
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.220]   grumbling about our relationships, our families,
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.580]   our friendships, our roommates,
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.260]   just our general situation and status in life?
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.980]   Maybe the complaining has made way
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.020]   for coveting what others have.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.860]   Have we been like just ungrateful people?
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.780]   Are we discontent?
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.820]   Surrender these things.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.940]   Repent of these things.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.860]   What about other sins?
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:51.420]   Selfishness, impatience, irritability, pride, bitterness.
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.540]   So all of these things,
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.900]   what would it look like not to tackle these things
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.660]   just with wisdom and signs, you know?
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.660]   What would it look like for us to go into this,
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.340]   understanding what it means?
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.660]   How does God view this?
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.460]   Not to just like think of strategies
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.780]   of how to tackle a problem
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.980]   or just things that we're going to do
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.220]   in order to be able to fight against something.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:19.180]   Our own willpower goes only so far, and you know that.
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.180]   As we pray, we have to surrender
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.140]   and we have to receive Christ.
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.580]   He has to be the center of these things.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.460]   Is Christ enough for me?
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.420]   Is Christ the one I love?
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.460]   Do I believe that Christ has conquered my sins?
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:40.260]   Pray.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.100]   And then pray this putting on portion.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.860]   Pray in gratitude for the salvation
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.660]   given to you through Jesus.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.700]   Pray in gratitude for all the good blessings
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.420]   and gifts you have in your life, both seen and unseen.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.780]   Pray for the fruit of the Spirit
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.820]   to be cultivated in your life.
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.500]   Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.100]   faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.260]   Pray for a forgiving heart
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.420]   that's slow to anger and quick to listen.
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.780]   Pray for trust in the Lord
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.260]   in whatever situations are going on in your life right now.
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.220]   Pray for contentment in Christ alone in these situations.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.220]   Pray for a growing and passionate love
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.580]   for Christ in all things.
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.340]   Pray for a growing heart of compassion
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.540]   and love for the lost.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.260]   And so there's a lot of work to do in prayer.
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.380]   So for the next 20 minutes,
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.540]   we're gonna be playing a track,
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.660]   and this is your opportunity to surrender.
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:29.740]   And please don't just pray religiously.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:33.780]   Because we've been so conditioned
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.420]   to pray religiously sometimes.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.180]   Open up your hearts and be vulnerable
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.140]   before the Lord again.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.500]   And ask Him.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.660]   Ask Him to give you wisdom.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.460]   Ask Him to give you strength.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.420]   And pray in true repentance
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.980]   that you will turn away from sins
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.180]   and wholeheartedly embrace God.
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:55.980]   I'll be back in about 20 minutes.

[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:04.740]   - Pray for us.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:09.740]   Heavenly Father, as we lift up to you our hearts,
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:14.740]   I pray that we would actually be laying our hearts bare,
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:18.740]   that our words wouldn't be filled with emptiness
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:21.740]   but full of desire, and God, that you would be honored
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.740]   and pleased in the sacrifice that we might give.
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:29.740]   Lord, we're so weak, but we thank you that it is,
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:32.740]   even in weakness, that your power can be made complete
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:35.740]   and sufficient and enough for us.
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:39.740]   We thank you, Lord, that it is not by the size of our faith,
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:43.740]   but, God, that we can come to you and believe
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.740]   that you can even use us.
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:48.740]   And so, Lord, I pray that before we're able
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:50.740]   to go into the next part of prayer,
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:53.740]   of requesting many things,
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:56.740]   that first we would be empty before you,
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:56:01.740]   and, God, that there would be a purity in our motives.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.740]   And so, Lord, as we sing a song to you,
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:08.740]   I pray, God, that our hearts would be honest and genuine,
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:12.740]   and, Lord, that our desire and our need for you would grow.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.740]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:17.740]   Let's stand and sing the song before we go to our next.

[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:34.740]   As we go into this final time of prayer,
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:38.740]   I know that, as Pastor Peter kind of mentions
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:41.740]   quite frequently during the prayers and prayers,
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:44.740]   these big lumps of time can be very hard
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:48.740]   for those of us who are not regularly practicing prayer.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.740]   It's not the easiest thing to do.
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:53.740]   And just as he regularly encourages us,
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:57.740]   I pray, as I was praying, I was praying that for all of us,
[00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.740]   that even in those times where it's difficult
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:03.740]   to wrestle through it and to continue in prayer,
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.740]   to continue in prayer.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.740]   And just as he says, I'm going to say tonight,
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:12.740]   do what you need to do in order to stay concentrated on God,
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:15.740]   to get up, to pray.
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:18.740]   If you need to move around a little bit,
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.740]   to come back and continue in prayer.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:23.740]   Like he says, sometimes you can go get water.
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.740]   If you need to get into a posture of prayer, please do.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.740]   And so during this next time, the next 20 minutes,
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.740]   we're going to be praying for some things going on
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:32.740]   in the church.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.740]   And like I said, it's going to be very small.
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:35.740]   I'm sorry.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.740]   But the smaller one will be right behind me here.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:41.740]   We're going to be praying for the building up of the church.
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:44.740]   So I've listed out just many things.
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.740]   You don't have to pray just for these things.
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:50.740]   But if you can, kind of search and think about the things
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.740]   that God has placed on your heart.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.740]   But we can be praying for the family ministry.
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:57.740]   We have three different ministries within family,
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.740]   Jubilee for FIG and for FAM245.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.740]   We can be praying for each of these ministries.
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:05.740]   There are many different events that each one hosts.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.740]   These things, a lot of us are a part of these things.
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.740]   So we know a little bit intimately more how we might
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.740]   be able to pray.
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:13.740]   But pray for the staff.
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.740]   Pray for those who are serving in these ministries.
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:19.740]   Pray for--as we're praying for family ministry,
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.740]   we can pray for engaged couples.
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.740]   Even in preparation for family ministry,
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.740]   we can pray for those who are dating too.
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.740]   Pray also for our BAM.
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:31.740]   Pray for contentment in relationship status
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:32.740]   and career placement.
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:35.740]   We know those two things are the regular things that whenever
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:38.740]   they get together, BAM, isn't this so much of what
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:39.740]   we talk about?
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:44.740]   And pray that that wouldn't be the idol so heavy that this
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:45.740]   is all we talk about.
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.740]   Pray that they would use their time strategically for God's
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.740]   kingdom, that they might be great evangelists
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:53.740]   in their workplaces.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:57.740]   And pray just overall for kind of the isolation that can
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.740]   happen in this season of life.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.740]   Pray also for our college ministry,
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:05.740]   for upcoming transitions, for new students who are coming in.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:08.740]   The semester system students are going to be coming in come
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:09.740]   August.
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:12.740]   Pray for opportunities for discipleship and evangelism.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:15.740]   Pray how you might be able to reach out to the college
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:16.740]   students.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:20.740]   Pray for the college staff and the small group leaders.
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.740]   Next, we could pray for our education ministry, our SO,
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:26.740]   for our youth, our elementary, our nursery.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:30.740]   Even for the youngest, we can pray that they would come to
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:31.740]   saving faith.
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:35.740]   Pray for the elementary students as they're beginning to grow
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:39.740]   in knowledge of God's word for the youth students as they are
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:45.740]   in many ways thinking and battling with what they believe.
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:46.740]   Pray for the teachers.
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:49.740]   Pray for strength and endurance in them.
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:52.740]   Pray that they would have a deep love for the students,
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.740]   for the children, and that they would handle the word with care,
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.740]   that they would prepare well, that they would be prayerful in
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.740]   their lives.
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.740]   Pray for the upcoming Bible study that's going to be coming
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.740]   in pretty soon in a few weeks now.
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.740]   We're going to be going through the tenfold covenant.
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.740]   And as we do that from week to week,
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:13.740]   pray that we would, again, use this Bible study time to examine
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:16.740]   our hearts and that God would be with the ones who are teaching
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.740]   it as well.
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.740]   They might be careful in handling God's word.
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.740]   Pray for the home group leaders and pray for the small group
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:23.740]   leaders.
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:28.740]   Sometimes halfway through it can be very exhausting because of
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.740]   many things going on in life, too.
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:31.740]   And so please pray for them.
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:34.740]   Pray for their purity of heart.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:38.740]   Pray for them to have genuine love for Christ and for them to
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:41.740]   have genuine love for their groups.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:43.740]   Pray for the leadership of the church,
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:44.740]   for wisdom and discernment.
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:47.740]   We're coming into, again, another season of our church.
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:50.740]   So pray for the leadership, for personal integrity,
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:51.740]   for purity and for holiness.
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:54.740]   Pray for a growing fear of the Lord and a growing love for the
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:55.740]   Lord.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.740]   Pray for their families.
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:59.740]   And then pray for the lost.
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:01.740]   Pray for lost people in your life by name,
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.740]   by situation, and pray in faith.
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.740]   Pray remembering that aside from all of what it is that we've
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.740]   been trying to do, that God is the only one who can melt their
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:12.740]   hearts.
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:14.740]   So pray to God in faith, in desire,
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:17.740]   pleading and desperation that he would melt their hearts to allow
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:19.740]   their eyes to see.
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:22.740]   And then pray for some of the upcoming events in the church.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:25.740]   The Taiwan mission team is going to be doing a fundraiser on
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:26.740]   Sunday.
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:30.740]   But pray as they continue in training for their team unity,
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:32.740]   for God to open clear opportunities for the gospel
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:33.740]   there.
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:37.740]   You can pray for Alex Han and his family and the church they're a
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:40.740]   part of, the Hope Bilingual Church.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:43.740]   And lastly, please pray for the family retreat that's coming up.
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:46.740]   Dr. Street is going to be preaching there on God's design
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.740]   for marriage.
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:52.740]   So much of the church is going to be foundational upon strong
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:53.740]   families.
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:56.740]   And so pray for our families in preparation.
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:58.740]   Pray for husbands.
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:00.740]   Pray for wives.
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:04.740]   Pray that these would become God-exalting families that begin
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.740]   with godly husbands and wives.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.740]   And that there at the retreat there would be actual change,
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:14.740]   actual repentance, actual movement towards not just living
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:18.740]   the same way that these families have constantly been living,
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:22.740]   but moving forward and believing that God can change our hearts,
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.740]   that believing God can change our husbands,
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:26.740]   believing God can change our wives,
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:29.740]   and that we can be a church that actually believes in a spirit
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:31.740]   who changes and transforms us.
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.740]   So pray in faith for all of these things.
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.740]   Again, it's going to be about 20 minutes.
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:39.740]   And I'm going to come up and we're going to sing a final song
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:42.740]   together with the praise team, and then I'll conclude that time
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:43.740]   in prayer.
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.740]   So let's spend this time now to pray.

[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:39.740]   [music]
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:49.740]   Father, we pray God that we would really have that desire inside of our hearts
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:53.740]   to not just pray these things, but to continue to pray.
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:57.740]   And God, to live in obedience to your will.
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:02.740]   And so God, much of what we prayed, I pray God that we would go and do,
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:07.740]   that we would act in accordance to the desires that we profess to you tonight.
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:13.740]   Lord, I pray in that way your church would be a sanctifying presence in this world.
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:17.740]   I pray, Lord, that the many ways in which we apply
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:20.740]   the convictions that you've brought onto our hearts,
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:23.740]   that it would change the way we spend our time,
[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:27.740]   it would change the way that we would spend our time with our families, our friends,
[01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:33.740]   the way we deal with our coworkers, the way we feel, how we think.
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:38.740]   God, that it would trickle into every part of us.
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:44.740]   And Lord, that our testimony would be great amongst the people in this world.
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:47.740]   Father, in a place that has grown so dark,
[01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:50.740]   there are so many more things that we must pray for.
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:56.740]   And so God, I pray that in that your church would continue to be the place of prayer.
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:59.740]   And so God, thank you.
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:02.740]   Thank you that you are the one who is working,
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:05.740]   that despite our weaknesses and our failures,
[01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:08.740]   we can trust in you with all of our hearts.
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:12.740]   We can trust that you are going to do what is best and what is good.
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:17.740]   And so Father, we pray that that would empower us to be bold,
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:19.740]   to be men and women of conviction.
[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:22.740]   Lord, that we would open our mouths to speak,
[01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:26.740]   and that we would never be ashamed of you or your gospel.
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:30.740]   And so Lord, thank you for the precious time we have to pray together.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:35.740]   And God, thank you that you've given us such a blessing, this thing called prayer.
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:39.740]   And so Lord, as we go now, whatever it is that we do,
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:42.740]   we pray that it would be honoring to you.
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:44.740]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:46.740]   Well, we have one quick announcement here.
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.740]   So if you can have a seat.
[01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:52.740]   I believe there's a slide that was sent.
[01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:57.740]   But there's going to be a Taiwan Missions fundraiser.
[01:30:57.740 --> 01:31:04.740]   And this is kind of in direct, I guess, conjunction to some of what we prayed tonight.
[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:10.740]   So then one of the applications can be that you pay for some food and make it happen.
[01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:16.740]   And so the Missions fundraiser is going to be after Second and Third Services this coming Sunday.
[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:22.740]   The Taiwanese sausage and rice, they said it's a pretty accurate picture.
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:24.740]   I don't know if they used AI to do that, too.
[01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:27.740]   But it's going to be like cucumber, corn, sausage and rice.
[01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:28.740]   Yeah, that's perfect.
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:31.740]   And so that's going to be $10 for adults, $5 for kids.
[01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:35.740]   And then there's also going to be winter melon milk tea for $5.
[01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:39.740]   I heard they are going to be making boba, but there might not be enough for every cup.
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:42.740]   So you might want to go fast and get that boba.
[01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:48.740]   And the big one is on Subsplash.
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:54.740]   So if you go to the app and go under the Giving tab on our app, there's going to be this thing called Subsplash.
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:57.740]   It's the way in which we give our offering.
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:00.740]   The whole thing is called Subsplash, actually.
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:02.740]   And we're testing it out.
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:07.740]   And so it says offering and it says the India pastors.
[01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:12.740]   But for now, it's included an extra thing called Taiwan missions or something along those lines.
[01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:14.740]   And so you can actually do that earlier.
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:15.740]   You can do that tonight.
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.740]   You can do that tomorrow.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:21.740]   So that on Sunday, all you need to do is just kind of bring it up, show them like the receipt.
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:24.740]   So that'll make everything go a lot faster and smoother as well.
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:28.740]   The other option is you can bring cash on Sunday.
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:29.740]   So those are your two options.
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:31.740]   There are actually no other options for this.
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:35.740]   So please be prepared to give one way or the other.
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:40.740]   If you have any other questions, go ahead and you can ask me or anyone from the Taiwan missions team.
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:42.740]   Pastor Mark is probably the man you can ask.
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:45.740]   So and that is it for tonight.
[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:50.740]   We're going to be asking everybody to leave at a certain point in time.
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:54.740]   We'll kind of go around and start shutting things down somewhere down the line.
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:33:03.740]   But our college ministry is going to be by maybe about 930 shutting down this parking lot because we're going to start preparing for a car wash that we're doing tomorrow.
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:10.740]   So if you're if you're parked here by about 930, if you can either move your car and you can continue to loiter or just go home.
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:12.740]   OK. All right. Thank you, everyone. Have a good night.
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:28.740]   Before the sky.
