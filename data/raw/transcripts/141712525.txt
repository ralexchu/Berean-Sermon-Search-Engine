[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740]   (audio cuts out)
[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.000]   But the husband does.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   And likewise also, the husband does not have authority
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.960]   over his own body, but the wife does.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.960]   Stop depriving one another,
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.520]   except by agreement for a time
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.800]   so that you may devote yourself to prayer
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.880]   and to come together again so that Satan will not tempt you
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.900]   because of your lack of self-control.
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.140]   But this I say by way of concession, not a command.
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.380]   Yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am.
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.440]   However, each man has his own gift from God,
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.500]   one in this manner and another in that.
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.480]   But I say to the unmarried and to widows
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.920]   that it is good for them if they remain even as I.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.440]   But if they do not have self-control, let them marry,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.440]   for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.440]   But to the married I give instructions,
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.920]   not I but the Lord,
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.140]   that the wife should not leave her husband.
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.400]   If she does leave, she must remain unmarried,
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.640]   or else be reconciled to her husband,
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.360]   and that the husband should not divorce his wife.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.560]   But to the rest I say, not the Lord,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.480]   that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.560]   and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.480]   And a woman who has an unbelieving husband
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.240]   and he consents to live with her,
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.680]   she must not send her husband away,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.480]   for the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.440]   and the unbelieving wife is sanctified
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.960]   through her believing husband.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.200]   For otherwise your children are unclean,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.940]   but now they are holy.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.200]   Yet if the unbelieving ones leave, let him leave.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.880]   The brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.160]   But God has called us to peace.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.000]   For how do you know, O wife,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.760]   whether you will save your husband?
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.080]   Or how do you know, O husband,
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.320]   whether you will save your wife?
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.080]   Okay, let's take a moment to pray,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.840]   and then we'll jump into the study.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.440]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.220]   God, we thank you for your love to us.
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.120]   We thank you for your care.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.460]   But we thank you, Lord God, that you care for us
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.680]   as our Heavenly Father.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.760]   We thank you, God, that you love us
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.260]   according to your holiness, according to your discretion.
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.240]   So God, I thank you that you instruct us.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.600]   I thank you, God, that you cause us to be holy.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.800]   And I thank you, Lord, that you discipline us at times.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.600]   And Father, I pray that in every way we would desire
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.680]   to receive your word with gratefulness
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.400]   and to receive it with an eagerness
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.640]   to apply it into our lives.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.840]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.680]   Okay.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.680]   Now, by way of introducing this passage to us,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.600]   you gotta imagine, you just noticed there,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.760]   Apostle Paul did one of these things
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.760]   where he essentially addresses many different people.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.480]   He addresses the single people.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.040]   He addresses the married people.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.760]   He addresses the divorced people, the widowed people,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.680]   the married people with unbelieving husbands,
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.320]   the married wives with unbelieving,
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.640]   you know, I'm sorry, married husbands with unbelieving wives.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.360]   He addresses all different types of scenarios, you know?
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.960]   And I find that really interesting
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.200]   because you can then imagine,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   just like it is a very confusing climate in our generation
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.000]   to begin a romantic relationship
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.020]   and ultimately get married,
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.760]   likewise, you can see that perhaps
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.800]   there was a lot of confusion in that time as well, okay?
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.300]   Now, talking about dating a little bit,
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.080]   a lot of people assume that I had
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.360]   an incredibly conservative perspective on dating,
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.400]   which I guess in many sense I do,
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.560]   but there was a huge movement where people wanted dating
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.840]   to look different than what it does now,
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.040]   so they started calling it courtship.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.200]   Have you guys heard that?
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.320]   We shouldn't date, we should do courtship, you know?
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.720]   And the idea there was like,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.840]   because we were so intent on marriage,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.920]   the way you date is like, go talk to the father
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.320]   before you even talk to the girl, you know,
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.240]   basically apply, get permission,
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.280]   and then you're able to court this girl
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.920]   for the purpose intentionally for marriage.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.080]   And I always clarify to people,
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.480]   I actually don't believe in courtship.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.380]   And they're like, really?
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.660]   But you know, you believe that dating should be
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.840]   for the purpose of marriage, absolutely.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.640]   You believe that you should remain pure
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.520]   and you shouldn't like date around and all this stuff,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.320]   and I'm like, sure, sure, sure.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.320]   But I love the fact that there is good analogy in life,
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.520]   which is fishing, okay?
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.080]   You're fishing.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.920]   And the thing about it is,
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.600]   sometimes you cast nets that are wide,
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.200]   sometimes you use little lures,
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.580]   sometimes you use little poppers,
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.400]   and sometimes you use huge, like,
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.240]   oceanic, huge, real, you know,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.440]   so the idea there is, I think there is some wisdom
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.560]   in the idea that there isn't just one absolute way
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.240]   that you can big brush and say,
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.640]   everybody needs to date like this.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.200]   Now, there are wrong things to do, okay?
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.080]   You shouldn't be fishing in the Santa Ana River,
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.000]   you shouldn't be fishing for poisonous fish.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.600]   You should only be fishing for keepers.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.640]   There are fish that are only good for throwing back,
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.860]   but you should be fishing for keepers.
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.700]   That's the kind of way that I like to advise people to fish.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.540]   I mean, sorry, date.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.760]   Sometimes it's more highly important
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.860]   who you're searching for than how I do it.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.880]   Now, obviously, there are clear things you shouldn't do,
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.280]   and we learned about that last week.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.620]   Fornification is wrong in any circumstance.
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.120]   Joining yourself to an individual,
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.920]   no matter how much you say you love that person
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.280]   outside of marriage, is absolutely wrong, right?
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.360]   And joining yourself in even, like,
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.440]   emotional ties and physical ties,
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.560]   obviously, should be very, very much,
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.060]   you should approach that with caution.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.740]   You should be honorable in everything you do, right?
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.600]   But in my personal perspective,
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.880]   depending on who you are, what your strengths are,
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.320]   and how you think, and where you are
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.160]   on your faith level, even,
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.920]   the things that you do, even in dating,
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.000]   is gonna be a little different.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.680]   And depending on who you're trying to pursue,
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.560]   that'll also look a little different,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.880]   and you have to leave room for that.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.160]   So what's interesting is, I think about this scenario,
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.720]   and just as complicated as the dating environment
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.920]   in modern day is, you can imagine the dating environment,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.480]   perhaps the relational environment back then
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.680]   was really complicated as well.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.720]   And you had people of different persuasions.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.480]   Some people would be like,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.920]   okay, so like the good Asian parent,
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.320]   if you guys have ever suffered under that,
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.480]   you turn 25, before 25, it was just like,
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.880]   I want you to focus on school,
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.280]   I want you to focus on your career,
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.480]   and then you turn 25, it's like,
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   why aren't you married,
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.620]   or what are you doing with your life, you know?
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.640]   You know what's really funny is the Jewish people
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.440]   thought the exact same way.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.160]   I really think Jewish people and Asian people
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.960]   would have a lot in common.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.200]   But because the Jewish culture was so much bound up in,
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.480]   God wants you to multiply.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.020]   God has intended for you to be married.
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.880]   If you didn't get married, it almost was like,
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.640]   why are you being so rebellious, you know?
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.200]   Like, do you want to offend our family?
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.720]   What's going on with you?
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.440]   So there was this pressure.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.920]   And isn't there pressure in our day?
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.960]   Yeah, there is.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.200]   And then obviously there's other cultures that say,
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.800]   no, I don't wanna get married that early.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.500]   I want to go find myself, find my freedoms,
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.680]   make something of myself, you know?
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.960]   And then there's other cultures,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.200]   and you can imagine it's like, relationships.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.040]   Who needs 'em?
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.240]   Or other cultures that might think,
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.820]   not only who needs 'em, but that's very sinful of you.
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.360]   Is that all you think about?
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.440]   You passionate, lustful, female,
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.560]   very base and fleshly person.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.460]   You can imagine that, but there might be people
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.460]   who would say, it's holier for you to remain single, right?
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.400]   So very interesting mix, very interesting mix
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.520]   of different cultures that have joined together
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.840]   to make what is the culture of the Corinthian church.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.320]   We're taking a look at this now,
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.320]   and we're only looking at verse one through seven,
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.280]   but again, if you look at the whole chapter,
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.160]   he's going to hit different scenarios,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.720]   different circumstances, different people, okay?
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.840]   Let's take a look together at verses one through two.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.440]   And in verses one through two, it says,
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.320]   now concerning the things about which you wrote,
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.800]   it is good for a man not to touch a woman.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.680]   But because of immoralities,
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.640]   each man is to have his own wife,
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.200]   and each woman is to have her own husband.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.480]   Okay, starting there, I wanna ask the easy question,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.240]   what is Apostle Paul advocating in verse one?
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.460]   Just easy observation.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.360]   Someone please raise their hand and tell me,
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.860]   what do you think Apostle Paul is advocating here?
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:31.200]   I'm sorry?
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.020]   - Get married.
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.800]   - Get married, okay.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.680]   Verse one.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.920]   - Get married.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.000]   - Get married.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.260]   (laughing)
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:48.200]   - So verse one, definitely not get married,
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.160]   but it's good for a man not to what?
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.000]   Touch a woman.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.600]   So what is he really advocating in verse one?
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.960]   Someone, what did he say?
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.480]   - Intimacy, marriage.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.360]   Intimacy, marriage.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.840]   - Intimacy in marriage?
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.000]   But he's saying it is good.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.720]   He's not advocating that.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.160]   His questioners are.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.000]   - Okay, okay, okay.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.720]   - He's asking about a question.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.040]   Hey, is it, in light of all the fornication in chapter six,
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.280]   should we then go to the other extreme?
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.640]   - Right.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.760]   - Not even, the extreme of the husband
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.640]   can't even be with his wife?
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.480]   - Right.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.600]   - That's the question they asked him.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.440]   - Right, right.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.320]   - And he says about what you wrote,
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.840]   so he's not saying married couple can't be together.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.680]   - Good, good, okay.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.760]   Just jumping so far ahead of me right now.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.000]   (laughing)
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.680]   - That's all in verse one.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.520]   - That's all, okay, it's true.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.880]   All right, so did you guys hear what he said?
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.560]   Okay, what he said is this, is,
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.840]   remember here in chapter seven,
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.600]   you gotta think, this whole discussion
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.200]   is coming in the context of interaction
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.560]   with the church already asking questions, right?
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.040]   And so what Matthew is saying is,
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.840]   you can imagine that these people
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.320]   are saying stuff like, man,
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.800]   with all the stuff that's around us in our culture,
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.680]   the promiscuity and the sexual indulgences,
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.160]   we should not even, should we not even touch a woman at all?
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.680]   Okay, now he's saying that Apostle Paul
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.520]   is not advocating singleness, okay?
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.720]   Now, that will be the conclusion
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.400]   of all of chapter seven.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.200]   So, there we go, we've just finished Bible study.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.080]   (laughing)
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.800]   The conclusion is, so let me give it to you now
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.680]   because it is a good point.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.320]   If you were to ask, what is Apostle Paul
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.600]   advocating in this chapter,
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.360]   is he advocating celibacy over marriage at all?
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.520]   No, but actually, as a matter of fact,
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.940]   is he even advocating marriage over celibacy?
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.000]   No, okay?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.320]   Apostle Paul is not advocating and saying
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.120]   the condition of your life in terms of your relation,
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.840]   this is what needs to happen in every single person's life.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.560]   That is not what he's doing.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.280]   So, I guess I should have rephrased this question.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.400]   What does it appear to be that Apostle Paul
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.120]   is advocating in verse one?
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.480]   In verse one, it appears as though
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.920]   Apostle Paul is saying, oh yeah,
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.520]   to not touch a woman is good.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.560]   That is at least an evaluation question.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.440]   What's good?
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.400]   It's good for a man not to touch a woman, right?
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.120]   And to say a man not to touch a woman
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.840]   is to say, I declare celibacy.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.640]   I'm not gonna have a relationship with a woman, right?
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.520]   So that's verse one.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   But the harder question is,
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.840]   why is Apostle Paul writing this?
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.740]   And we've just talked about it in a moment here.
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.180]   There is great confusion, okay?
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.160]   The church is having a,
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.560]   really, an incredibly difficult time
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.400]   applying what Apostle Paul has been teaching them.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.360]   It's like, you know?
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.320]   So you can just imagine.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.120]   This happens to people all the time.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.480]   We do extremes.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.040]   It's like, hey, we should have,
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.320]   oh, please stand that way.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.840]   We should have freedom because what we do,
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.760]   you know, in the flesh doesn't really matter.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.920]   You go out this way.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.680]   Apostle Paul tries to correct that and say,
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.700]   no, you don't have freedom.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.420]   How dare you join yourself with, you know,
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.600]   promiscuous individuals, prostitutes,
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.840]   just for your gratification.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.640]   It matters absolutely, incredibly a lot
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.540]   what you do in the flesh.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.960]   Because you are, you are gonna have immortal bodies, okay?
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.320]   Now, the pendulum swing then is to go the other way
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.180]   and be like, okay, then with all these immoralities,
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.920]   then we're not gonna touch any woman.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.240]   You know, and you can imagine in the vision,
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.480]   'cause is that how we apply?
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.600]   Is that what we're supposed to do?
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.540]   And we sometimes do that, you know?
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.000]   We sometimes exaggerate or pendulum swing,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.500]   and you can imagine people doing that
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.400]   and perhaps even saying stuff like that.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.180]   So, there is this great confusion.
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.720]   Now, I have a question for you guys
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.380]   that's a little bit more personal,
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.180]   and it's there underneath verse two.
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.860]   How do you make sense of this seemingly
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.060]   and incredibly practical reason for marriage?
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.600]   Does it sit well with you?
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:17.820]   Okay, Kim, because you shake your head
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.980]   and you're like, no. (laughs)
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.020]   So, tell me, I know part of it's a little bit obvious
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.420]   as to why, yeah, it might not sit well with us,
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.300]   but just kind of verbalize,
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.460]   how does it first sound to you,
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.360]   and why does it not sit well with you?
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:43.900]   Right.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.320]   - That it's because of that,
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.660]   that's why we shake our head.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.500]   - Okay.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.180]   - That's why it doesn't sit well with me.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.020]   I don't think God's in favor of just that.
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.220]   - Yeah, good, good, okay.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.860]   Anybody wanna add anything else?
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.700]   Yes.
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.700]   - It's totally not spiritual enough.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.700]   (laughs)
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.340]   - It's just not spiritual enough, okay?
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.580]   So good.
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.980]   Yeah, I mean, when you read this,
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.740]   it should initially kind of hit you as like,
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.220]   but that's odd, you know?
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.620]   Just like what Karen said,
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.220]   the purpose of marriage as, you know,
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.820]   ideally we would wanna practice it,
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.580]   it wouldn't be like, wow,
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.060]   I'm just burning with passion right now.
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.580]   And definitely I would never approach a woman,
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.500]   you know, when you're single and be like,
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.620]   I chose you because I just can't control myself.
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.140]   You know, like. (laughs)
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.820]   Do you wanna go out with me? (laughs)
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.740]   And also, obviously, it's just on a level
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.340]   of talking spiritually and fleshly,
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.500]   which just sounds too fleshly, you know?
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.820]   But as we think about this,
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.100]   as we think about this,
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.620]   I guess let's keep that there for a moment,
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.660]   'cause the more that we tackle this passage,
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.700]   we're gonna realize, yes, this is practical,
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.060]   but there is more, obviously, than meets the eye.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:02.940]   Okay?
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.580]   All right, good.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.340]   Any questions about section one, verses one and two?
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.460]   The introduction of the issue at hand
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.140]   in the church of confusion,
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.180]   celibacy, marriage, what do we do?
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.340]   Okay?
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.180]   All right.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.820]   Moving forward.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.420]   Verse three to five.
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.060]   Can I have somebody read this for me nice and loud?
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:25.900]   Yes.
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:34.700]   Yes, oh, okay, okay.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.980]   You know, to tell you honestly,
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.500]   I think I placed that question poorly, too.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.460]   This is a question that will arise as we study,
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.900]   so let's come back to it
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.980]   as we wrap up the study at the end, okay?
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.980]   All right.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:52.060]   Verse three to five.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.220]   At this table over here, can I have,
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.140]   Titus, can you read that for us?
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.220]   - Oh, yes, sir.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.500]   The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife,
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.740]   and likewise also the wife to her husband.
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.260]   The wife does not have authority over her own body,
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.900]   but the husband, she does.
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.500]   And likewise, also the husband does not have authority
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.020]   over his own body, but the wife does.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.620]   Stop defiling one another, except by agreement
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.540]   before a time so that you may devote yourselves
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.460]   to prayer and coming together again,
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.980]   so that saints will have mercy on you
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.860]   because of your lack of self.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.660]   - Okay, good.
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.980]   So, let's do an exercise right now.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.980]   We've got four questions underneath the observations.
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:35.620]   Remember, observations is like such an integral part.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.380]   You know, all the steps that we've already rehearsed
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.700]   many times is an integral part of good Bible study.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.980]   I ask you four questions.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.340]   Can you guys just take time now to answer it on your own?
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.380]   How does it describe the responsibility of a man and woman?
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.260]   What is the reason why they have this responsibility?
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.980]   Under what circumstances can a couple refrain?
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.100]   And why does Paul give this exhortation
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.460]   not to deprive each other?
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.300]   Okay?
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:03.180]   Okay, so it looks like just about everybody is in.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.580]   Let's go over the questions quickly
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.300]   and then speak about what this passage,
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.540]   how this passage connects with all that Apostle Paul
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.840]   is saying in relation to celibacy and marriage, okay?
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.980]   So, first question, how does it describe
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.260]   the responsibility of a man and woman towards their spouse?
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.460]   That table over there.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.140]   About, Eric, you wanna try it?
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:38.420]   Okay, they should give it to each other.
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:42.460]   Now, in your estimation, is it just they should?
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.220]   Or how does the passage describe that responsibility?
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.140]   They must.
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.420]   If you look at your Bibles,
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.660]   the NIV translation would classify that
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.900]   as this is the conjugal right of the married individual.
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.180]   In the NASB translation, it'll say
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.780]   this is the duty of the man and the woman.
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.140]   A man must fulfill his duty, right?
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.820]   Okay?
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.480]   And then, so then thinking about that,
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.140]   the, I guess, the responsibility towards our spouse,
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.200]   even to something like physical intimacy,
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.740]   which we would perhaps oftentimes classify
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.080]   as something that should only happen
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.220]   when there is true love and romance, right?
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.060]   The Bible calls it duty.
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:35.440]   To the degree where, look, you don't have a choice, right?
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.360]   This is what you need to do.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.640]   You don't have authority or say in this.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.040]   Your spouse does.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.780]   Okay, but number two, what is the reason
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.700]   why they have this responsibility?
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.900]   Someone from that table?
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.240]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:56.100]   Good.
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.300]   So that's one of them is
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:03.700]   the repercussions of not obeying this responsibility
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.460]   or caring and fulfilling this responsibility
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.140]   is the negative consequence.
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.340]   You're gonna be very susceptible to sin.
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.180]   You're, the spouse is going to be lacking,
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.500]   longing and wanting, being wanting, right?
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.540]   And then what's another reason
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.220]   why they have this responsibility?
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.860]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.620]   Yeah, so this is the thing that I was kinda saying,
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.440]   you know, maybe I put the order a little bit wrong.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.060]   I asked a question about
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:36.100]   does this really practical way
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.920]   of approaching the marriage relationship
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.520]   that Apostle Paul is, you know, seemingly saying,
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.020]   does this not sit well with us?
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.460]   And to some degree, it doesn't sit well.
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.100]   But we realize in Apostle Paul's mind,
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.700]   there's more that meets the eye than just,
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.100]   you know what, if you guys are just lusting,
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.700]   then just get married, you know what I mean?
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.300]   What he's seeing is he sees the nature of the relationship
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.020]   in a unique way, perhaps very different than his culture.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:01.840]   Okay?
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.560]   He is seeing the unity that exists
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.700]   between a husband and wife
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.500]   as an incredibly unique unity,
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.260]   a harmony to the degree
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.920]   that the individual does not have authority
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.420]   even over his own body,
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.020]   but rather as one,
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.580]   they essentially share authority over their body
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.020]   because they're one.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.740]   You're not your own, right?
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.620]   And so what he's seeing is in that context
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.020]   of that special relationship,
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.540]   that is where that physical intimacy, right?
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.120]   That is where that sexual drive should exist.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:46.120]   Now, in my mind, if you think about that,
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:51.260]   there's a sense in which, yes, perhaps for us,
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.340]   if we were to think about duty,
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:59.020]   if we were to think about necessity and rights,
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.360]   it's just not romantic.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.720]   It doesn't fit our culture.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.100]   But if you think about their culture
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.660]   and how Apostle Paul is actually teaching these individuals,
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.440]   this is incredibly in contrast to what they used to think.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.340]   For example, there's a sense in which
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:19.000]   there are some commentators that translated this passage.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.920]   Again, so you can tell there's a little bit of a nuance
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.640]   in translating this verse.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.160]   I mentioned that the A&SB says,
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.280]   hey, man, fulfill your duty.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.720]   Another person says this woman has conjugal rights.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.840]   And another guy who was translating this
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.720]   kind of on his own and writing his commentary said,
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.640]   the man should render to the woman
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.680]   the affection that is due to her.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.580]   That's the way he translated it.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.640]   Because in terms of fulfilling the duty,
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.920]   that's kind of how the Greek actually literally means.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.520]   It's just rendering.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.560]   And that duty is not just a sense of like,
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.820]   well, that was what was commanded me, bam, here it is.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.300]   It's a responsibility.
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.040]   It's a privilege.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.320]   And the thing about it is, I think,
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.560]   if you were to then look at this
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:10.520]   as that sexual intimacy should only take place
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.000]   in an exclusive relationship
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.920]   under these limited parameters,
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.900]   what we have there is something precious.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.960]   It's something not common.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.760]   It's something not to be practiced just outside.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.220]   It's something that's not supposed to be
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.320]   just an everyday thing in the sense that,
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.000]   back then, it wasn't so uncommon
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.960]   for husbands to marry, divorce,
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.440]   and do that, let's say, 20 times.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.920]   Back then, it wasn't so uncommon
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.400]   where individuals would have relationships
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.960]   with many different women or many different men.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.800]   And so to have now a teaching that says,
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.280]   no, we wanna have that sexual intimacy be a precious thing
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.560]   under the specific requirements in an exclusive relationship,
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.640]   that's so much more than what they would experience
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.840]   back then.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.280]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.280]   So, number one, yes, it does sound highly practical.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.920]   And the thing about it is this one passage
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.640]   does not give us the exhaustive teaching on marriage
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.100]   and why we get married.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.680]   So, truthfully, this is a practical reason
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.440]   why you should get married,
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.720]   because you want to, you long to,
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.360]   have that kind of relationship and intimacy, right?
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.680]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.120]   this doesn't in any way diminish the preciousness,
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.840]   the kind of, the way that we, perhaps,
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.840]   view a marriage in our day, okay?
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.760]   Now, he talks a little bit about here
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.600]   under what circumstances can a couple
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.500]   refrain from sexual intimacy?
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:43.640]   Over there on that table with Mel, Michelle, Frannie?
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.480]   - Times of prayer.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.160]   - Times of prayer.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.680]   Especially trying to specifically focus
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.280]   on a spiritual aspect of growth
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.080]   or maybe in a unique circumstance.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.040]   But he says, what's really interesting about that,
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.500]   he says, I'm gonna go back to my Bible.
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.520]   What's really interesting about that is he says,
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.480]   "Make sure you come back together again
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.520]   "so that Satan will not tempt you
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.560]   "because of your lack of self-control," right?
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.160]   Now, what's really interesting about this whole thing,
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.600]   this scenario, again, is,
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.320]   right now, I just tried to make a case for you,
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.800]   saying, like, hey, the practicality
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.960]   of Apostle Paul's reasoning to get married,
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.840]   it doesn't diminish, perhaps,
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.400]   the intimacy and romance of marriage.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.220]   But there's a sense in which, realistically,
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.640]   there is a high practicality to this.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.600]   And that highly practical reason is what?
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.760]   The reason why he would give this exhortation
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:49.240]   not to deprive each other is, table over there,
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.600]   with Andrea, Diane, and?
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.440]   (papers rustling)
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:25:05.760]   Okay, so that Satan will not have an opportunity to tempt.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.140]   So, if you were to think about this,
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.560]   there's almost a sense that you gotta ask the question,
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.800]   you know, what does Apostle Paul care more about
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.400]   as he is addressing this issue?
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.200]   (coughing)
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.080]   Right, think about that as you look at this passage.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.200]   He's trying to teach you that celibacy can be good,
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.680]   marriage is very good in the design of God,
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.600]   and that sexual intimacy should happen,
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.480]   this is the design of God, that sexual intimacy
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.160]   actually, exclusively, would happen
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.280]   in this marriage relationship.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.720]   But what is he more concerned about
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.060]   as he's teaching on this topic of celibacy and marriage?
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.620]   (papers rustling)
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.260]   Anyone?
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:53.260]   Yes, that's okay.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.580]   - The first five. - Five.
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.740]   - Stop depriving one another.
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:57.580]   - Yeah.
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.940]   - Instead of placing them separately,
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.300]   so that they can be part of each other.
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.620]   - Yeah, I think that's a great question.
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.060]   He's giving a command saying, stop depriving each other.
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.580]   And that's an excellent thing to do,
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.220]   is ask the question, what does that say
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.060]   about the people of the time?
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.820]   I think their word, it's funny because chapter six,
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.460]   he's rebuking these individuals
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.740]   for being sexually permissive,
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.740]   but then obviously there's other people,
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.220]   other people in the church who perhaps,
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.460]   maybe it was because they had a transition
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.500]   from their pagan ritualistic
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.520]   and highly sexualized worship services,
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.600]   to now how they were trying to apply purity in their lives,
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.100]   and they almost feel like,
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.600]   I can't physically touch my wife either.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.040]   You can imagine people perhaps in that day and age,
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.800]   depriving each other that way,
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.680]   in a confused and misinformed thinking of,
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.760]   to be celibate is holier than marriage.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.880]   To go above God's standards and essentially say,
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.300]   to do this, to have this restriction, is to be holier.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.560]   Yeah, I think there are people like that.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.400]   Good question.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.540]   Over there, yeah.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.000]   - I think he answered your question.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:08.840]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.160]   - He called me a poet.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.040]   Whether you're celibate or married,
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.760]   the ultimate goal is to be a greater ministry.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.600]   - Okay.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.080]   - So if you're talking to marriage,
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.440]   let's say it has to do with why God is gentler than marriage,
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.720]   but perhaps in a sense that we turn the first book
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.280]   to the point on ministry, what are we doing?
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.680]   Things aren't good at home,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.760]   it affects you, or it affects you to whoever it is.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.880]   So I think perhaps maybe that's what he was doing,
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.320]   but I'm not sure that that's what he was doing.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.040]   - Good, thank you.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.200]   Absolutely.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.840]   Yes, other points.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.920]   - Just to add to that, Paul's really concerned
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.240]   about the integrity of their covenant,
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.680]   because the two are one.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.520]   - Yeah.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.520]   - This chapter was, we're one with Christ,
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.200]   therefore we can't have sex outside of marriage,
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   because that defiles Christ in a sense, spiritually.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.040]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.000]   - So he transitions here to talk about men and women
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   in the same respect, because in Paul's mind,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   the gospel is, marriage is a reflection of the gospel.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.360]   That's why it's so important for marriage
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.560]   to the integrity of that covenant to stay strong.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.720]   And one way, the chief way the enemy is gonna tear it apart
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.400]   is through unmarriage.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.800]   Or when one or two in a couple,
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.400]   or if it's a couple are depriving each other of intimacy,
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.960]   that enables the enemy to rip them apart.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.400]   There goes the reflection of the gospel.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:31.360]   - Right, good, thank you.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.340]   Great points, okay.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.960]   So here now, absolutely,
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.660]   to go off of what Matthew is saying,
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.880]   there's a sense in which the Paul's Apostle Paul begins with
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.560]   to not touch a woman is good, and it can be very good.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.480]   But celibacy is not good in the context of marriage,
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.820]   because that's not how God designed it.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.120]   In marriage, you're supposed to have intimacy.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.520]   In marriage, you're supposed to have an attitude
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.680]   of being willing to give the other person.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.600]   In marriage, you're supposed to have the attitude of love
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.280]   in which you're really satisfying and rendering
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.000]   that affection that is due to the other spouse.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.200]   And that all's supposed to happen
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.160]   because what Apostle Paul's really concerned about
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.600]   is a spiritual focus of every individual
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.640]   that he's talking to.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.680]   Spiritual focus.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.960]   If you're not functioning as you ought,
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.020]   if you're not functioning as God designed,
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.480]   if you're not also fulfilling
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.560]   what God has allotted you in your life,
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.920]   you're not gonna be able to focus.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.680]   And so what Apostle Paul is saying is,
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.440]   look, I'm giving you these various precepts.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.960]   I'm not giving you an incase statement,
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.280]   everybody needs to do this,
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.800]   but I'm giving you various precepts
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.240]   because according to your lot in life,
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.840]   you need to be faithful in order that
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.800]   you stay spiritually focused, okay?
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.360]   And so that's why in moving to verse,
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.560]   the next section, Paul's permissive command,
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.400]   try to do a little play on words here,
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.600]   I asked you the question,
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.720]   what is the difference between a concession
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.480]   and a command earlier?
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.680]   Do you guys have any comments about that?
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.720]   Anybody from the rest of the table that I can call on?
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.120]   I asked the question in your warm-up discussion,
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.020]   what's the difference between a concession and a command?
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:21.300]   And another important question to think about
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.900]   as you think about that one is,
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.960]   he said a lot already in the first six verses
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.240]   of chapter seven,
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.880]   what do you think he is specifically referring to?
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.960]   Everything, is celibacy a concession, not a command?
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.680]   Is marriage the concession or not a command?
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.240]   Don't deprive each other,
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.160]   is that the concession and the command?
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:54.200]   Okay, so think about that.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:59.320]   Verse six, he kinda introduces what he's gonna say,
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.520]   he says, "I say by way of confession, not a command."
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:07.040]   And he says, "Yet, I wish that all men
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.880]   "were even as I myself am.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.300]   "Each man has his own gift from God,
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.920]   "one in this manner, and another in that."
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:25.160]   Okay, so I read this verse because
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.320]   right now I feel like,
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.880]   if you just were to read that,
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.680]   there's a sense in which, gosh,
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.760]   it is a little confusing.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.560]   What is Apostle Paul referring to when he says,
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.960]   "This is a concession and not a command?"
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.840]   And what is Apostle Paul referring to when he says,
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   "I wish that all were as I am."
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.220]   Okay, yes.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:47.480]   Okay.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.140]   [woman speaking off mic]
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.120]   Okay.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:06.680]   Good.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:11.240]   Okay.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:19.400]   Right, okay.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.280]   So, she's saying that the concession
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.520]   is not everything he's been talking about,
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.600]   it's just the immediate reference before,
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.000]   which is, if you decide by mutual agreement
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.840]   to deprive each other for a little bit,
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.200]   abstain so that you can focus,
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.720]   that is the concession.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.920]   That's what I think.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.840]   There are commentaries that'll say
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.200]   he's talking about something broader.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.160]   I don't think so.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.720]   I think Apostle Paul, he would be the first one,
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.240]   if you look at his other letters,
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.200]   and I'm gonna ask you in your discussion time
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.960]   to draw up other passages that teach the purpose
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.000]   and the environment of what godly marriage
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.400]   should look like.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.560]   And so, knowing what Apostle Paul says about marriage,
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.460]   he is not going to say that marriage is the concession.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.320]   Okay?
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.600]   Because it is by God's ordained plan
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.320]   that the union of marriage be something
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.840]   that is reflective of his character, of his gospel,
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.520]   and it speaks so much, volumes.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.440]   And so, that being the case,
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.400]   Apostle Paul expects that the marriage relationship
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.840]   be characterized by intimacy.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.440]   And he says, so that time away from each other,
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.280]   that's the concession.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.680]   It is not a command.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.940]   Okay?
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.440]   Now, he then contrasts that and says,
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:41.440]   yet, I wish that all men were even as I myself am.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.200]   So, we're kind of drawing things
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.040]   to a little bit of a close here.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.640]   And in thinking about this,
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.560]   I ask this question about what is the advice
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.160]   really in verse seven,
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.800]   and must all men follow his advice?
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.640]   Okay?
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.120]   In thinking about this, I wanna,
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.560]   well, actually, let me give you guys an opportunity
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.960]   to just answer the question.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.480]   In verse seven, when he says,
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.600]   I wish that all men were even as I myself am,
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.640]   what do you think he's referring to?
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.560]   And what then would he desire that all men would be like?
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:25.520]   Yes?
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:30.520]   >> Is it the ability to be fully devoted to God?
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.920]   >> Well put.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.320]   >> Whether in the context of celibacy or inheritance.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.160]   >> Good.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.240]   I actually really like the way you said that.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.640]   Okay?
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.560]   She said, it's the ability to be fully devoted to God
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.760]   in either context.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.080]   Yeah?
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:54.280]   Well, let me say this, yeah.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.600]   >> I'd say we can go back to verse 32.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.600]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.560]   Later on, he's gonna say a couple things that,
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.160]   and likewise, verse 32,
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.000]   but I want you to be free from concern.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.960]   So, excellent.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.640]   So let's tie a couple things in together,
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.400]   'cause this is important, okay?
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.240]   There's a sense in which Apostle Paul, practically speaking,
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.760]   is gonna say practical wisdom, okay?
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.640]   So do you know what?
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.280]   For those of us who are completely engrossed
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.680]   in the relationship atmosphere,
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.840]   and perhaps we've bought into certain ways of thinking
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.560]   where it's like, everybody has to get married
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.400]   and I have to get married,
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.280]   or if you're already married,
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.080]   you're like, all my friends have to get married.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.760]   And so there's some of us who are like,
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.960]   I am the matchmaker that God sent to you,
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.800]   so listen to me when I say this, you should go for her.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.400]   Or when he asks you, just say yes.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.560]   You feel like you need to get everybody married, okay?
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.840]   And I know some of us have good intentions in that,
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.660]   so don't feel like I'm just dogging you or whatever,
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.480]   but there are people who think like that.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.880]   They look at somebody and it's always like,
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.000]   why aren't you married?
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.840]   Now, if you think about these scenarios,
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.600]   dang it, I totally lost my train of thought, all right?
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.320]   If you think about these scenarios,
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.580]   Apostle Paul gives practical wisdom in that.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.080]   If you think about what he's gonna say
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.020]   in the next couple of verses,
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.200]   he's gonna give practical wisdom in that.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.440]   There are those of you who will function better
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.080]   if you're married, okay?
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.520]   But then he also gives practical wisdom
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.700]   in other verses later on, where he says,
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.800]   look, if you stay single like I did,
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.180]   then you're going to relieve yourself
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.500]   of some of the concerns that exist.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.760]   And it is absolutely harder for a married man
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.840]   to do what I do.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.400]   I mean, can you just jump on a boat?
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.240]   Can you be beaten?
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.080]   Can you be persecuted?
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.260]   Can you be chased out of towns?
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.000]   Can you just go for days hungry?
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.040]   Can you be shipwrecked with a family?
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.320]   So, Apostle Paul actually gives a lot of practical wisdom
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.680]   through these verses.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:03.960]   And we actually have to heed that
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.820]   and we have to think about it.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.280]   But I like the way that Grace put it is,
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.680]   but Apostle Paul, his intent,
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.440]   later on if you read verse 32,
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.640]   I'm gonna read the whole section for us,
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.740]   verse 32 to 35, this is something really important
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.000]   and something that I preached on before
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.040]   and it's good for us to review.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.000]   Verse 32 says, "But I want you to be free from concern.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.560]   "One who is unmarried is concerned
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.900]   "about the things of the Lord,
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.680]   "how he may please the Lord.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.220]   "But the one who is married is concerned
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.100]   "about the things of the world,
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.960]   "how he may please his wife.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.620]   "And his interests are divided.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.520]   "The woman who is unmarried and the virgin
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.560]   "is concerned about the things of the Lord,
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.580]   "that she may be holy both in body and spirit.
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.640]   "But the one who is married is concerned
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.320]   "about the things of the world,
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.420]   "how she may please her husband.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.940]   "This I say for your own benefit,
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.820]   "not to put a restraint upon you,
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.540]   "but to promote what is appropriate
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:01.340]   "and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord."
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.780]   So in all honesty, in other passages of the Bible,
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.120]   he's gonna say, what is marriage?
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.820]   What is singleness?
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.240]   In the end, those are just two circumstances of your life.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.260]   What is Apostle Paul really pursuing after
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.500]   is the ability to have committed,
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.060]   undivided attention to God, right?
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.660]   And that is what he desires.
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:22.900]   You know what's really interesting to me
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.780]   is I always believed, not always,
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:29.060]   but up until a little, maybe about a year or two ago,
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.020]   I just always assumed that Apostle Paul
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.620]   was a single man all his life.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.700]   But after some thinking about it,
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.820]   I think actually Apostle Paul was probably a married man,
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:42.900]   but either his wife passed away or she left him.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.420]   And you can imagine why.
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.260]   Because Apostle Paul was a member of the Sanhedrin.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.420]   Apostle Paul was an up-and-coming leader
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:55.180]   in the Jewish environment of the whole religion, okay?
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.740]   He was a leader amongst leaders.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:01.100]   And earlier I mentioned to you that there is a culture
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.100]   where if you're not married,
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.180]   then you're just not obeying the will of God.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.860]   And like perhaps a lot of different religious environments
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.260]   in our day and age, if you're not married,
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.660]   then they don't see you as like,
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.420]   I don't know if you're qualified to be our leader.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.020]   I'm pretty sure that Apostle Paul
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:17.460]   had that criteria checked off, you know what I mean?
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.840]   And what's more, later on when he speaks in verse eight,
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.900]   when he says, "To the unmarried and to the widows,
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.720]   "he say I say it is good for them
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.140]   "if they remain even as I,"
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.280]   he associates with who?
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.340]   The widows and the widowers.
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.140]   He associates with them.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.780]   And I think there's a sense in which Apostle Paul
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.940]   knows what it means then to be married,
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.320]   and he knows what it means to be single.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.820]   And in all this, he's not saying,
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.220]   I wish everybody was just like me,
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.620]   going through all sorts of hardship,
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.420]   going through all sorts of the various different struggles
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.940]   of individual who's been married and done that.
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:58.660]   But again, I think he's really focusing on this idea of,
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.220]   in the lot that God has given you,
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:05.420]   if you are single, there is an emphasis
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:08.940]   on being devoted to the Lord in that singleness.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.300]   And if you are married, then fulfilling
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.300]   every responsibility of that marriage
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.540]   that's still in your marriage,
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.060]   you are faithful to the Lord.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.660]   Does that make sense?
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.540]   And so either where you're single,
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:21.940]   you don't give room for the devil.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.300]   When you are married, you don't give room for the devil.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.280]   And spiritually, you're devoted.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:30.540]   I think that's the intent of Apostle Paul, okay?
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.500]   So, by way of conclusion,
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.300]   the principles in this passage are important,
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.260]   and he makes very clear, look,
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.060]   there's nothing wrong with celibacy.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:41.400]   As a matter of fact, it's a gift.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.300]   There's absolutely nothing wrong with marriage,
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.060]   and there's absolutely nothing wrong with sex
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:48.060]   in the marriage, because that too is a gift.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.300]   So earlier, going back all the way around to
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.820]   Grace's question, I think it was Grace who asked,
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.060]   I asked the question, how do you harmonize the idea
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.780]   that celibacy is good with the following verses?
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.900]   Genesis 2, 18, it is not good for a man to be alone.
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.260]   Genesis 1, 28, be fruitful and multiply.
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.180]   Proverbs, he who finds a wife,
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.780]   a good wife, finds a good thing.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.400]   How do we reconcile the two?
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:18.160]   Anybody wanna take a shot at just,
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.760]   someone asks you the question, I'm a little confused.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:25.700]   Apostle Paul is giving us some wise wisdom,
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.780]   but he says this is good in multiple occasions.
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.580]   Is it good to be celibate?
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.600]   What's best?
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.500]   How would you respond?
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.380]   You know?
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.580]   Brother, sister, I'm really confused.
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.020]   What's best?
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.740]   Try to stay single and fight my desire?
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.260]   Get married and fight the distraction?
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.540]   I mean, what's best here?
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.660]   Yes.
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.100]   - Pursue and enjoy the gift God gave you.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:57.680]   - Nice, he says, pursue and enjoy the gift God gave you.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.780]   Anything else you guys wanna add to that?
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:08.080]   You know, I asked the question at the end,
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.360]   you know, the advice that Apostle Paul gives,
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:14.120]   does every man have to try to obey
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.960]   every single advice in this chapter?
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.920]   And I think the great answer to that is what Matthew said.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.640]   You need to be thankful and pursue the gift
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.520]   that God has given you, and be faithful with that gift.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.700]   If God has given you the gift of celibacy,
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.940]   and that definitely is a gift, okay?
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.960]   Not everybody has a gift, but it's a gift.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.320]   And if God has given that to you,
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.420]   thank the Lord and be found faithful with that gift.
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:43.920]   But if God enables you to find a woman, a husband,
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:48.120]   be thankful for that gift and be faithful with that gift.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.640]   That's how you can reconcile this idea.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.320]   There's passages in the Bible that says, get married.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.600]   Other passages, stay single.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.240]   What's best?
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.440]   What's best is the allotment that God has given you,
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.080]   rejoice and give thanks to the Lord.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:01.920]   Okay?
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.000]   All right.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.240]   Any questions about this passage?
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.080]   Yes.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.240]   - One last thing is that Paul's encouragement
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.480]   to stay single or, you know, it's good to stay single,
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.360]   that's more of an actual advice,
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.400]   more than what I read.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.000]   Genesis 2.18, that's what was commanded from God.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.280]   God said it was not good for man to be alone,
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.480]   therefore I'll make a single helper.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.320]   That seems to be like, we're not good alone.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:28.600]   I need a helper to back us to become one.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.440]   - Yeah.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.280]   - Max is born.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.120]   - Okay, okay.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.840]   - It seems like without my helper, I'm not able to.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.640]   So it's like God's command in Genesis 2
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.960]   versus Paul's practical advice,
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.160]   verse 57.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.000]   - Yeah.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.840]   - So when I go forth, don't start a girl's marriage.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.680]   Five verses, okay?
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.400]   One, not good for man to be alone, right?
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.520]   Which leads to, if you find a wife, find a good thing.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.640]   Which leads to three, children are good.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.560]   You know, we multiply, which leads to four,
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.120]   children are a gift, which leads to five.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.040]   You're on your sixth, tells us to raise our kids.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.240]   So maybe all five verses, plus it's God's command,
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:05.080]   I would rather encourage everyone to get married.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:05.920]   - All right.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.280]   It's a great question, you guys heard his question, right?
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.320]   Okay, sure.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.640]   So just so you guys know the question,
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.320]   which is a great question.
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.840]   Here in 1 Corinthians, it sounds like a practical advice,
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:20.040]   but then the stuff of the verses seems more
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.640]   like the framework of mankind, more a general principle.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.920]   Okay.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.080]   - You're absolutely right.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.080]   Paul's practical advice is very contextually limited
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.880]   to this period of history, short term.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.440]   Because, verse 29.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:42.160]   Verse 29 reads, "But this I say, brethren,
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.800]   "the time has been shortened."
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.600]   The time has been shortened, so there's something going on
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.680]   in his day and age, which gives him this urgency
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.320]   about practical advice.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.880]   "The time has been shortened, so that from now on,
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:00.880]   "those who have lives should be as though they had none.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.960]   "And those who weep as though they did not,
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.800]   "and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice,
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.560]   "and those who buy as though they did not possess,
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:13.200]   "very interesting, and those who use the world
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.360]   "as though they did not make a whole reason for it,
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.320]   "for the form of this world is passing away."
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.440]   Paul's practical advice is, after all,
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:25.160]   because of a quickening that's happening in the culture,
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.680]   and I think it's because of the announcement
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.440]   of persecution, and that's why he's saying,
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.720]   don't have to rejoice, and don't have to,
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.320]   you're gonna just possess everything,
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.080]   because you don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.960]   There is a quickening of the pace of global events
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.240]   at the time, which is going to make it so much harder
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.520]   to be married, stay married, raise children.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.040]   There's a lot at stake.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.000]   If you're married, can you imagine your wife
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.400]   being tortured in front of you?
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.240]   What would you do?
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.600]   How would you handle it?
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.400]   That's what Paul's sitting on, rising,
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.960]   so his practical advice is just a concern
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.720]   in light of what's coming.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.960]   You're absolutely right, in general,
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.080]   that is God's concern.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.760]   He's thinking about that.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:05.800]   >> Yeah, good.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.040]   Good, good.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.680]   So the answer on the level of,
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.680]   contextually, in understanding the environment,
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.920]   understanding their times is good,
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.560]   but also, again, comes back to the idea that,
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:25.640]   if you look at those principles that we see
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.760]   from Genesis and the Book of Proverbs and whatnot,
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.880]   so you see what it is, is I can say something like this.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.120]   It seems that, for just about everybody,
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.400]   just about, the general principle
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.880]   and the general lifestyle that a Christian is going to live
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.440]   is going to be in the context of family.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.120]   It seems that God, for the most part,
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.920]   wants people to have marriages
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.280]   and marriages that are godly, right?
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.720]   But it's very clear, too, that,
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.480]   not just through this passage,
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.480]   but in other examples in the Bible,
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.120]   God has used people who were by themselves,
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.840]   were not married, but were incredibly fruitful
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.920]   and used by God, right?
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.360]   And in no way were they disobeying.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.520]   the general principles of God,
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.360]   but that's because that was specifically
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.280]   God's gifting to them.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.560]   So, other examples, like there's so many examples of that.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.480]   There's a lady by the name of Anna, you know,
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:21.560]   who essentially devoted her life
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.960]   to praying and serving in the temple.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.360]   And she had lost her husband,
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.200]   but she remained single and served in that way.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.280]   But that was her lot, and she was found very faithful.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.480]   So there's a difference between, let's say,
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.480]   teaching in the Bible that is a direct command
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.720]   and application to all, obviously,
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.840]   as opposed to this, perhaps,
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.400]   in redemptive and collective human history,
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.720]   is a general projection of every man,
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.240]   but obviously you have giftings that,
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.000]   obviously, God has expected various things
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.640]   from their lives, you know?
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.560]   So we have to have a category for that, too.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.280]   General principle, specific gifting, you know?
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.200]   Well, thank you for that explanation, Matt.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.000]   That was really good.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.680]   Okay, any other questions?
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.820]   Sorry, Matthew.
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.760]   Any other questions?
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.360]   (murmurs)
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.640]   Okay, great.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.080]   So I hope you guys have a good time of discussion.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:17.200]   I do think we should talk about, like,
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.080]   you know, some of these passages,
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.880]   especially, just take a look at verse eight and nine.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.000]   Sometimes you will hear these passages,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.600]   and then sometimes maybe you heard good advice from it,
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.480]   and sometimes maybe you heard bad advice from it, you know?
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.080]   Talk about that and thinking about,
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.520]   this is wisdom, you know?
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.960]   What I mentioned on Sunday,
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.640]   I feel like 1 Corinthians teaches you
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.240]   such great wisdom about life.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.360]   Yeah, it's wisdom.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.920]   And so, when you think about giving advice to people,
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.020]   how should we do it?
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.480]   What are our limitations in that?
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.280]   I think we should talk about that, okay?
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.360]   All right, let's bow in prayer,
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.640]   and then you guys can jump into your discussion time.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.880]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much, God.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.480]   We thank you, Lord, that in thinking about this whole topic,
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.280]   we realize, Lord, you have gifted us.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.160]   God, you have constantly given to us, and we thank you.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:09.520]   Father God, we also pray that we would be found faithful.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:13.880]   Lord, that we would not become so self-centered,
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.200]   self-seeking, and God, that our ambitions
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.200]   would not get the best of the scenario,
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.960]   where we want things outside of your blessing.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.520]   We want things outside of what you've ordained.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.000]   And dare not be, Father God, that we would, you know,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.120]   put ourselves above your scripture,
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.920]   above your standards, and go overboard.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.560]   I pray, Father God, that rather,
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:35.840]   we would continue to walk in a way
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.360]   where our greatest desire is to be
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.520]   most pleasing and faithful to you.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.040]   That regardless of the circumstance,
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:46.080]   we would desire to abide in your will,
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:49.520]   and God, truly, do things according to your way.
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.820]   Father, I do pray that as we've been talking a lot about,
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.800]   perhaps, physical purity,
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.120]   we've been talking about marriage, and all that stuff.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.120]   And Lord, we all confess, actually,
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.080]   this is a huge facet of our lives,
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.480]   and for many of us, this is probably
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.040]   one of the more distracting elements of our lives, as well.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.560]   I pray, Father God, that you'd both grant us
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.480]   clarity of the issue, but also strength, Lord God,
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.320]   that we might persevere through
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.160]   various circumstances of our lives.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.960]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:20.920]   Alright.
