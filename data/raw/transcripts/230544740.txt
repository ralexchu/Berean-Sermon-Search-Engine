[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   Ephesians chapter 5 verse 15 to 21.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.080]   Let me read that again for you all and follow along with me.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.160]   Start from verse 15, chapter 5 of Ephesians.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.120]   Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.120]   because the days are evil.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.760]   Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the word of the Lord is.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.000]   And so remember if you were here from the first session, taking those two verses, I
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.200]   talked about walking by the word, which is the wisdom of the mind.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200]   And again, we talk about wisdom.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.800]   It's not just knowing or having information, but the purpose of that wisdom, the purpose
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.720]   of the word is for your transformation.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.480]   And then verse 18 says this, do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.280]   what filled with the spirit and in our second session together, I talked about walking with
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.400]   the spirit, which is the wisdom of life, the wisdom of life, that the spirit of God empowers
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.400]   us.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.360]   The spirit of God is the presence of God in our lives as he dwells in us.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.760]   That's that empowers us to live out the Christian life through what the word has implanted in
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.000]   you and I.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.600]   And then this morning looking at verse 19 to 21 addressing one another in Psalms and
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.280]   hands and spiritual songs, singing and making memory to the Lord with your heart, giving
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.520]   thanks always for everything to God, the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.040]   And in verse 21 submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ, out of reverence
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.040]   for Christ.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.760]   So this morning, take it from revision chapter five versus specifically verse 20 to 21.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.800]   What I want to share with you is this walking love, walking love, which is the wisdom of
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.560]   the heart or the wisdom of the soul, right?
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.280]   Walking love and giving thanks as Paul mentions here, it says, always give thanks, give me
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.280]   thanks always.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.600]   And it's not always easy to give thanks.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.760]   It really isn't.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.440]   By giving thanks to God for everything is evidence of faith in trusting God.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.440]   There's a little too much echo.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.240]   If you lower the volume a little bit down, so we don't want that echo cracking.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.240]   Great, thank you.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.560]   And so giving thanks to God for everything is the evidence of faith in trusting God and
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:51.160]   trusting in not in circumstances or your situation, but trusting in his goodness, in his character,
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:00.560]   in his wisdom, trusting in God who does not change by the shadow of day, right?
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.840]   Let's be honest here.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.760]   You and I are pretty flaky.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.200]   We are, you know, Peter and I were talking about this and coming up and we're just, you
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.920]   know, there's things that ministers and pastors talk and share.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.200]   We have what we call common suffering.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   Okay.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.520]   There's common things we go through and suffer.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:34.280]   And it is absolutely true that one of the biggest disappointment for a pastor to have
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.640]   is to trust people because people are flaky.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.440]   People are not always faithful.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.240]   Some people are backstabbers, right?
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.360]   Some people are gossipers.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.880]   Some people are just plain, simply dumb.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   Dumb, dumb.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:03.080]   You know, one of my favorite movie characters is John Wayne, right?
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.040]   And he has the most, the best quote, the best quote that I love.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.080]   And he says, "Life is hard, but it's harder if you're stupid."
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.080]   Okay.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.080]   Amen.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.080]   It's true.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.080]   Life is hard.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.080]   And you know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.080]   I've been stupid many times.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.080]   I'm sure you've been stupid many times.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.080]   Right?
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:31.980]   That's why the Bible doesn't call us, you know, lions, horses, or eagles, go eagles,
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.980]   right?
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.720]   But the Bible calls us sheep.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   Sheep.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.800]   Because sheep are dumb.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.800]   Sheep are stupid.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.440]   They're so weak.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.300]   They're so finicky.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.920]   They're so cowardly.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.960]   They're, they're, they're, they're so pitiful animals.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.960]   Pitiful.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.240]   I mean, that's how God looks at us, right?
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.280]   Like we like to look at ourselves like, you know, like the eagle or the tiger, okay?
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   Or the bear.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.280]   Or the anteater.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   I'm just kidding.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.280]   But God looks at us as man.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.280]   Sheep.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.280]   Sheep.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.320]   And I've learned in my life too, and the thing about it, it's, it's, it's for me,
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.720]   I personally, I have this, it's a, it's a blessing and it's a shortcoming, right?
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.000]   Is this, I'm super loyal.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.800]   Like I am loyal.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.760]   Like, like if you're my friend, I am your friend to the end.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.160]   I am like really loyal.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.120]   And when, when, when I come across people and I put trust in people and I did that,
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.120]   and that loyal to me, I get devastated, devastated.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.120]   Some of you are like that, right?
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   No, no.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120]   I've never hurt people.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.120]   That's how people, you know, you know, I'm not a killer.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   I'm a lover, right?
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   Okay.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.680]   But you know, you, when you, when you trust your circumstances, when you trust in people
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.360]   who are so flaky and finicky, right?
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.360]   You can get disappointed.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.800]   That's why, you know, we can be faithful no matter what circumstances, situation we're
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.640]   in, because you ought to be, we trust in God.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.920]   We need to trust in God and trust in him and him alone.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.760]   And so giving thanks to God for everything, right?
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.360]   It's ultimately is trusting in his goodness and his character and his wisdom.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.720]   And so Paul goes out to say here, right?
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.040]   That giving thanks always for everything to God, the father, God, the father in the name
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.920]   of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:45.880]   He says in verse 21, submitting to one another out of reverence or out of what?
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   Love for God.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.880]   Now, hold on.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.880]   I said, this sounds like contradictory.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.880]   Okay.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.880]   Why would you want to submit to other people when you can't trust people?
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.880]   Right?
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.880]   I just share with you how flaky you are, right?
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.880]   How unfaithful we, we are all in many ways in our lives.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.600]   And so why would Paul then here tell us to submit to one another when you can't trust
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   one another?
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.880]   Because what Paul is trying to say is this, that ultimately our trust is not in people,
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.520]   but our trust is in who?
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.720]   In Christ.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.520]   And that God is sovereign.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.920]   God has control in every person in this world.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.920]   And think about it.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.600]   How many billions of people we have in the world now?
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.880]   I think last time I counted, it was like almost over 7 billion, right?
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.200]   Close to 7 billion.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.280]   That's so crazy thinking because 20 years ago, it was about 5 or 6 billion.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.280]   Too many people in the world, right?
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:54.960]   But the point is that just think about all the intricacies and individuals from, you
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.000]   know, whether they're in China or they're from Korea or they live in the US or, you
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   know, they live in Seattle or LA, whatever.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.200]   That God is in absolute control of every individual.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   That's mind-blogging to me.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   It's like, wow.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   Wow.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   Wow.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   Remember, I don't know if anybody is an X-Men fan.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   X-Men?
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   There was a doctor, no, no, was it a professor?
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   Xavier.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.200]   Xavier, right?
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   And he has this little chamber.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200]   He goes in, he puts this little thing on, and he's able to see all the what?
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   Mutants.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   Okay?
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   All right?
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   That's a sad example to give actually.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   God doesn't just see the mutants.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   He sees the people.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.200]   He sees the people.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.200]   And he's able to see all the people.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   And he's able to see all the people.

[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.200]   It doesn't mean that he never ever stopped being God.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.200]   So, when we look at Ephesians chapter 5,
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.200]   So, when we look at Ephesians chapter 5,
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.200]   it is very interesting where Paul makes a connection
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   it is very interesting where Paul makes a connection
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.200]   for sexual immorality, impurity, or covetousness
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.200]   that is what idolatry.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.200]   This is so interesting how he makes that connection.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   You can see, any sexual sin
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.200]   You can see, any sexual sin
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.200]   ultimately is the worship of self.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   ultimately is the worship of self.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.200]   Which is what?
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.200]   Root of all idolatry.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.200]   Root of all idolatry.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.200]   Now, obviously, we don't
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.200]   Now, obviously, we don't
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   text savvy,
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   text savvy,
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.200]   sophisticated,
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.200]   enlightened culture,
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   enlightened culture,
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.200]   we don't have images of Gods made from stone
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   we don't have images of Gods made from stone
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.200]   or wood
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   If you go to third world countries
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   If you go to third world countries
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.200]   or India, or even many parts of China
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   or India, or even many parts of China
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   even today, when you walk into a Chinese restaurant
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.200]   even today, when you walk into a Chinese restaurant
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.200]   you have a little image of
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.200]   you have a little image of Chubby Buddha
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   you have a little image of Chubby Buddha
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   which is a form of idolatry
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   which is a form of idolatry
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   but see, idolatry is basically, what is this?
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   is making God
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.200]   is making God into your image
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   that's what it is
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   and it's actually worship of self
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   and it's actually worship of self
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   and all sexual sin
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   and all sexual sin
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   it's a desire to fulfill
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   it's a desire to fulfill your pleasure
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   your pleasure, thus it is a worship
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   of self, which is idolatry
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   this is what Paul is saying here
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.200]   and he pauses
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   don't let no one deceive you
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.200]   with empty words
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   empty words
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   it says in verse 11, take no part in unfairful
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   works of darkness, but instead expose them
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   for it is shameful
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.200]   even to speak of the things
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.200]   that they do in secret
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.200]   I tell you, today's culture
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.200]   is very interesting times we live in
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.200]   there was a time in America
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.200]   that the greatest virtue
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.200]   everybody know what it was?
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.200]   the greatest virtue
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.200]   in America used to be truth
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.200]   truth
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.200]   look at all the universities
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.200]   even Berkeley
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.200]   considered one of the most liberal
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.200]   universities, Berkeley
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.200]   if you see there
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.200]   anybody graduate from
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.200]   Berkeley?
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   no? nobody?
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   what is your motto at Berkeley?
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.200]   no?
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.200]   really? even at Berkeley you don't know?
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.200]   look at the picture
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.200]   if you look at
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.200]   the Berkeley
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.200]   their logo, there's a book
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.200]   that's open, which is
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.200]   the Bible
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   and there's a torch
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.200]   and
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.200]   Berkeley's motto is
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   "let there be light"
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.200]   you look at all the universities
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.200]   that started
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.200]   but many of them
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.200]   are Christians, whether it's
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.200]   Yale
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.200]   or Harvard
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.200]   the virtue, the purpose of the universities
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   was to pursue what?
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.200]   truth
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   to pursue truth
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.200]   in the light of
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.200]   the gospel
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.200]   you know what the greatest virtue in America today is?
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   it's not truth
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   it's tolerance
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.200]   it's tolerance
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.200]   no longer is truth
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   it's tolerance, right?
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.200]   ok? now do you know how
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.200]   stupid that is?
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.200]   that is so stupid
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.200]   that's why today
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.200]   because our greatest virtue no longer is truth
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   it's tolerance, why?
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   all these
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.200]   sexual deviations
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.200]   like the Bible talks about, has become
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.200]   mainstream, not only mainstream
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.200]   it has become what? celebrated
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   whether it's
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.200]   transsexual, whether it's
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   homosexual, bisexual
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   whether it's polygamy
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   whether it's
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.200]   any sexual activity
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   outside of the context of marriage
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.200]   today, because in the name of tolerance
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.200]   it's not only accepted
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.200]   but it's celebrated
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.200]   think about how stupid that is, right?
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.200]   like, what would you think
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   if I said to my wife
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.200]   "honey, I tolerate you"
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   you think about that
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.200]   tolerance
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   is a cowardly way
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.200]   of accepting people, right?
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.200]   ok? without
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.200]   loving them
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.200]   and so
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.200]   we live in a culture today
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   of political correctness, right?
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   in the name of tolerance
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.200]   to accept all
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.200]   forms of
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   deviation that is contrary to
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.200]   scripture, which is not love at all
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.200]   because in society today
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.200]   tolerance is considered love, it's not love
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.200]   it's cowardice
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   and by the way
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.200]   the most
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   proponents, the group of people
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.200]   who are the most proponents of tolerance
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.200]   are the most intolerant
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.200]   think about that
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.200]   think about that
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   they are
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   I don't know if you guys follow what's happening to our universities
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   ok? today in our
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   schools, right? we have
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.200]   safe zones
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.200]   safe zones?
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.200]   what the heck is that?
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.200]   people are in our
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.200]   universities now, and some of you just
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   finished college, right? you know what I'm talking about
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   they're afraid to dialogue
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.200]   ok?
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.200]   clashes of ideals
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.200]   oh because I'm a snowflake
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.200]   don't tell me something that I disagree
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.200]   with you. Your language
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.200]   is offensive
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.200]   oh, that's hate speech
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.200]   you guys all smile and laugh
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.200]   you know exactly what I'm talking about, right?
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.200]   Berkeley, the University of
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.200]   Berkeley, that's known for truth
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   forsaken for truth
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.200]   now proponents of tolerance
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.200]   who have become the most intolerant
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   if they bring a speaker that is contrary
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.200]   to some of the beliefs, that is politically
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.200]   incorrect, what do they do?
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   they burn down the campus
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   now you look at me and say
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.200]   "Pastor Aaron, what are you talking about? How does that relate to the
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   gospel?"
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.200]   it has everything to do with the gospel
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.200]   because I'm telling you, we are living in
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.200]   times, and it is not going to get
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.200]   any easier, right? where
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   the gospel will be hate
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   speech
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   you look at me and say "Pastor, you're
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.200]   crazy, right? Look at Canada today
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   Peter and I were talking about this
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.200]   you can't say that
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.200]   homosexuality is a sin anymore
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.200]   churches that
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.200]   preach the gospel
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   preach repentance, point people
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.200]   to their sin and point them to
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.200]   Jesus Christ, right?
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.200]   are being shut down
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.200]   by the government
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.200]   this is not China
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.200]   we're talking about Canada
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.200]   you don't think that's going to happen to
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.200]   America? It's happening now
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.200]   that you can't even dialogue
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.200]   truth
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.200]   think about it, think about it in culture
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   or a university, how in the world are you
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.200]   going to evangelize a dying world
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.200]   without the gospel?
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.200]   when the gospel becomes
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.200]   offensive language
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   it becomes hate speech
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   these are the times
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.200]   we're living in
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   so I want to encourage you
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.200]   I want to challenge you, right? as Paul
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.200]   says, right? we're not to tolerate
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.200]   sin, because tolerance of sin
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.200]   is not love
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.200]   we are called to
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   expose the works of darkness
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.200]   speaking the truth
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.200]   in love
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.200]   and always, as Peter says
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.200]   in 1 Peter chapter 3
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.200]   always being prepared
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.200]   to make a defense to anyone
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.200]   who asks you for a reason
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   for the hope that is in you
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.200]   yet do it with gentleness
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   and respect
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.200]   see, love
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.200]   pleases God
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.200]   right? love pleases God
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.200]   that's the wisdom of the heart
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   that's the wisdom of the soul
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.200]   second, love
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.200]   bears one another's burdens
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.200]   turn with me to Galatians chapter 6
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   Galatians 6
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:21.200]   brothers, if anyone is caught
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.200]   in any transgression
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.200]   you
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.200]   who are spiritual
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.200]   should restore him
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   or her
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.200]   in the spirit of gentleness
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.200]   keep watch
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.200]   on yourselves
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.200]   lest you too be tempted
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.200]   Galatians 6
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   says here, but what?
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.200]   bear one another's
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.200]   burdens, so
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.200]   fulfill the love of Christ
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.200]   right? so what? love
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.200]   bears one another's
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.200]   burdens, there's just two things
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   when I talk about burdens, right? there is the
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.200]   general idea of
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.200]   people's struggles in life
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.200]   it could be financial struggle
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.200]   it could be marital struggle
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.200]   it could be relational struggles, it could be
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.200]   you know, maybe
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   once business is not doing so well
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.200]   okay, just burden
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.200]   it could be because their
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.200]   health is not good
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.200]   it's very generally speaking
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   your brothers and
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.200]   sisters' burdens
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   it's the idea of coming alongside
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.200]   right?
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.200]   to bear, to help
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.200]   carry, okay?
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   their burdens, specifically
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   here, what Paul is talking about
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.200]   is that if someone is caught
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.200]   in what? transgression
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   caught or fell
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.200]   into sin
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   okay?
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.200]   our job of those
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.200]   who are spiritual is not just
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.200]   pastors, but it's the idea of one
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.200]   who is mature, not perfect
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.200]   but mature
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.200]   should restore that individual
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.200]   in the spirit of gentleness
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.200]   so what is the
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.200]   the calling
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   of love? love
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.200]   bears one another's burdens
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   we are
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.200]   called to what? come alongside
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   if you have a brother and sister
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.200]   who's in sin, and to confront them
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   in a loving manner, with what?
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.200]   it says with all gentleness
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   right? and keep
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.200]   yourself, at least you too
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.200]   why? because we are all
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.200]   we could all fall into
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.200]   temptation
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   we are all prone, in one way or another
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   to fall into transgression
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   but see, bearing one another's burden
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   what does it do? it fulfills the law of
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   Christ
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   and Paul says, for if anyone thinks he is
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.200]   something, when he's nothing
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.200]   he deceives himself
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   what is he saying? be humble
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.200]   when someone falls into sin
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   you don't rejoice over that
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.200]   because it greased the Holy Spirit
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.200]   and it hurts the testimony of the gospel
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.200]   but we are called to what?
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.200]   love and care, and pursue
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.200]   those who might fall into sin
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   because why?
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.200]   because we are all weak in many
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.200]   ways, but let each one
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.200]   test his own worth
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.200]   and then his reason to boast will be himself alone
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   and not in his neighbor
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   for each will have to bear, what?
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.200]   his own load, right?
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   we all fight our own individual
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.200]   temptation, but we are also called
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   to what? love and bear one another's
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   temptations, and sin
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.200]   that's why being
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.200]   in community is so important
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   that's why having brothers and sisters close to your life
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   where you are able to openly
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   confess your sins
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.200]   and share about your struggles
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.200]   and your temptations
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   and let one who is taught
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.200]   the worst
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.200]   share all good things
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.200]   with one who teaches
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.200]   I'm going to show a picture
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   this is one of my favorite pictures
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.200]   of
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.200]   alright
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.200]   I love this picture
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.200]   okay
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   not because I served in the military
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.200]   right?
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.200]   it just shows
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.200]   it just
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.200]   it speaks volumes to me
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.200]   it speaks so much volumes
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.200]   to me
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.200]   you can look it up for a while
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.200]   but see in the military we have a
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.200]   motto, you know what that is?
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.200]   never leave a fallen comrade behind
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   never leave a fallen comrade
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.200]   behind
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.200]   in the military we have this
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.200]   motto, right? we believe that if someone is
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   wounded or someone is captured
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.200]   we will make every effort
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.200]   to go rescue that POW
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.200]   the prisoner of war
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   or one who is missing
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.200]   in action, called MIA
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.200]   that we carry
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.200]   each other's burdens
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.200]   the effort, the extent
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.200]   the degree, right?
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.200]   it's that motto of
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.200]   caring for our brother
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   caring for our fellow
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   comrade who probably been wounded
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.200]   or captured
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.200]   this motto is what makes the military
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.200]   so unique compared
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.200]   to any other organization
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.200]   any other organization
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.200]   and so my question to you is this
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.200]   how much more should the church
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.200]   that is redeemed by the love
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.200]   of God through the sacrifice of Christ
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.200]   care for one another
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.200]   and why? carry each other's
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.200]   burdens, because love
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   carries what? each other's burden
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.200]   amen church?
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   let me give you
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.200]   a
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.200]   let me give you an example
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.200]   John Troika
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.200]   come up here for a minute
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   he's my brother from another mother
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.200]   two things in common
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   we both love Dodger baseball
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.200]   go Dodgers, woo! yeah!
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.200]   and number two

[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   another common thing
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.200]   we're both good looking, alright?
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   (laughter)
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   let me just give you an example, right?
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   you know
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   sometimes in life
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.200]   life happens
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   it does happen
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.200]   and you know what?
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.200]   because of life, because of tradition
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.200]   I'm going to stumble and fall
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.200]   and if I stumble and fall
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.200]   the last thing I need you to do is
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.200]   kick me in the butt
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.200]   I need you to carry me sometimes
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.200]   pick me up brother
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.200]   can you pick me up?
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.200]   (laughter)
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.200]   and sometimes you're going to stumble and fall
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.200]   and I'm going to kick you brother
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.200]   but other than I kick you
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.200]   but I'm going to carry you too man
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.200]   come on man, let's get up here
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.200]   see, God calls us to carry each other
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   sometimes, right?
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   to help each other
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.200]   to encourage each other
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.200]   to pray for each other
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.200]   to love each other
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   that's what the burden of the Bible is talking about here
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   amen, let's give John a beautiful applause
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.200]   (applause)
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.200]   (applause)
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.200]   can we shut this down?
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   thank you, thanks brother
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   from another mother, amen
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   (laughter)
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.200]   love carries
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.200]   one another's burdens
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.200]   church
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.200]   it does
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.200]   and then verse 9 actually goes to say
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.200]   and let us not grow weary of doing good
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.200]   for in due season
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.200]   we will weep if we do not give up
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.200]   verse 10
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   so then as we have opportunity
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.200]   let us do good to everyone
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.200]   and especially for those
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.200]   who are in what?
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   the household of what?
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   faith, church
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.200]   the church
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.200]   love bears one another's burden
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.200]   Paul keeps saying
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   don't grow weary
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.200]   of doing good
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.200]   and I'm telling you, it's not easy
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.200]   carrying people's burdens
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.200]   because like I tell you, right?
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.200]   life is messy, people's issues
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.200]   are messy, but we don't abandon
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.200]   people's issues, we don't abandon
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.200]   them, okay?
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.200]   so don't give up, don't give up in doing
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.200]   good, keep loving
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.200]   keep serving, keep praying
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   keep striving, because why?
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.200]   the greatest philosopher said what?
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.200]   we are too legit to quit
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.200]   (laughter)
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.200]   (laughter)
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   Peter Pompano
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.200]   is the only one who knows what I'm talking about
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   the hammer said that, the hammer, MC Hammer
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   alright?
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.200]   I think he had a whole essay, what was it?
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.200]   Too
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.200]   Legit to quit, right? Okay
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.200]   we are!
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   we are the children of God, we are redeemed
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   by God, we are called to be the
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.200]   light of the world, we are called to be
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.200]   the salt of the world, we are the body
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.200]   of Christ
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   we are called to love one another
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   care for the
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.200]   brother and the sister
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.200]   finally, love never fails
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.200]   love never fails
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.200]   we love others because
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.200]   why? the love of
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.200]   Christ compels us
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.200]   Romans chapter 8, throw it to me
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.200]   Romans chapter 8
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   like I share with you
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.200]   you know, if you study and read through the book of
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.200]   Romans, Romans chapter 8 is the
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.200]   epics, the highlight
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.200]   the climax of this book
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.200]   in Romans chapter 8
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   it's such
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.200]   an awesome chapter
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.200]   and you know, we don't have time to
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   go through everything that
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.200]   Paul speaks about here in Romans
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.200]   chapter 8
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.200]   let's start with verse 26
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.200]   it says, likewise the spirit
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.200]   helps us in our weaknesses
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.200]   but we do not
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.200]   know what to pray for
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   as we ought to, but the spirit
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   himself intercedes for us with
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.200]   all means to do for us
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.200]   I love that verse, you know why? because you know, I don't know
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.200]   about you, there are times that I don't know what to pray
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   I don't
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.200]   alright, maybe you're spiritual
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.200]   I'm not that spiritual
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.200]   there are times where I go to my devotions and I don't
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   have words to pray, there are times
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.200]   where I've been
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.200]   in seasons of my life
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.200]   I've been in situations of my life
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   where I'm so overwhelmed
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.200]   by the circumstances, I just
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   I don't know what to say, but you know
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.200]   what the Holy Spirit does for us
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.200]   you know what this is saying here, in this verse
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.200]   that the spirit of God
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.200]   prays for us
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.200]   intercedes
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.200]   the spirit
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.200]   himself intercedes for us
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.200]   with growing to do
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.200]   for words
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.200]   in verse 27, and he
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.200]   who searches hearts knows
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.200]   what is the mind of the spirit
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.200]   because the spirit intercedes for the saints
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   again, reminding us that
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.200]   we are weak
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   and our prayer life are not
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.200]   as it ought to be, but you know what
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.200]   the prayer life of the spirit is always
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.200]   on point
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.200]   on target
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.200]   according to the will of God
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.200]   verse 28, many of you know this verse right?
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.200]   and we know that all
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.200]   we know that for all, for those
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   who love God, all things work together
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.200]   for good for those who are called
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.200]   according to his purpose
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.200]   verse 29, for those who he foreknew
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.200]   he also predestined
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.200]   to be conformed to the image of his son
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.200]   in order that he might be the firstborn
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.200]   among many brothers
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.200]   and those who he predestined, he also called
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.200]   and those who he called, he also justified
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.200]   and those who he justified, he also glorified
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.200]   you know what that is? this is the unbreakable
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.200]   chain of the gospel, I love it
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.200]   alright, what chain?
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.200]   the chain, the fact that we are
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.200]   predestined, the chain
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.200]   that we are called
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.200]   the chain that says that we are justified
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.200]   and that eventually we will be glorified
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.200]   remember I shared with you yesterday
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.200]   that you know God will begin a good work
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.200]   in you, will complete to the end
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.200]   and that you are not that powerful
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.200]   to even
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.200]   to stop God's
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   plan and purpose in our lives
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.200]   well Paul is reminding us here
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.200]   it's the gospel chain
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.200]   that is unbreakable chain
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.200]   yes
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.200]   and then he goes
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.200]   on to say here verse 31
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.200]   right, why? why is the
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.200]   gospel unbreakable?
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.200]   why is this gospel chain
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.200]   unbreakable? it says what then
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.200]   should we say to these things? these things
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.200]   that God
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.200]   loves us, his spirit dwells
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.200]   with us, that God
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   has called us, God has justified us
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.200]   and God will glorify us
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   why?
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.200]   so if God is for us, who can
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.200]   be against us?
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.200]   verse 23, 32 I'm sorry
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.200]   he who did not spare
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.200]   his own son but gave him up
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.200]   for us, how would he not also
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   with him graciously
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.200]   give us all things? so think about it
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.200]   right church, whatever you go into today
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.200]   whether it's the individual or as
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.200]   a church culprit, if you're going
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.200]   through difficult times, right
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.200]   you can always fall back to the
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.200]   truth and the glory of the
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.200]   gospel
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.200]   this is what Paul is saying, because if
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.200]   God who did not spare
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   his own son
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.200]   his own son
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.200]   for your salvation
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.200]   what it says here
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.200]   the promise is that how
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.200]   would he not also
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.200]   give him or give us
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.200]   graciously all
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   things so we can live this
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.200]   life through the
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.200]   spirit of God and through the word
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.200]   of God and by the grace of God
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.200]   and then he
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.200]   says who shall bear any charge
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.200]   against God's elect, right, there's no
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.200]   condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.200]   it is what God who justifies
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.200]   who is it to condemn
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.200]   Christ Jesus is the one who died
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   more than that, who was raised
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.200]   who is at the right hand of God, who indeed
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.200]   is interceding for us
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.200]   man, not only do we have the spirit of God
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.200]   who dwells in us, that intercedes for us
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.200]   we have the son of God
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.200]   who sits on the right hand of God
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.200]   interceding on our behalf
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.200]   church, what am I saying
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   we cannot lose
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.200]   winner winner, chicken dinner, amen
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.200]   do you see this?
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.200]   that's what he's saying here
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.200]   right, we have more than
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.200]   more than that
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.200]   who has raised us
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.200]   who is at the right hand of God
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.200]   who indeed is interceding for us, who shall
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.200]   separate us for the love of Christ
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.200]   he's saying we are what now
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   right
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.200]   all these things
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   who shall separate us for the love of Christ
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.200]   shall tribulation or distress
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.200]   or persecution or famine
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.200]   or nakedness or danger
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.200]   or sword
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:43.200]   it is a rhetorical question
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.200]   and yes
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.200]   in this earth, in this life
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.200]   we are like sheep like I told you, right
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.200]   and for your sake
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.200]   he says here we are being killed
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.200]   all day long
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.200]   we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.200]   but as Paul says, goes on to say here
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.200]   in verse 37
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.200]   knowing all these things, we are what?
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.200]   more than what? Conquerors
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:09.200]   and I told what time of
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   when my son was
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   young enough to play sports
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.200]   he's old enough to play sports now
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.200]   but I mean, when he was young
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   I used to love coaching
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.200]   I love coaching
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.200]   besides passion, coaching is one of the ways
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.200]   where you can
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.200]   influence young people's lives
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.200]   right
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.200]   and because I like sports too
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.200]   but when he was about
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.200]   I think 10 years old
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.200]   I was coaching 10, 11 year old
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   flag football
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:47.200]   and we had an awesome team
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.200]   I mean we would like
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.200]   destroy other
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.200]   teams
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.200]   okay, we would be on like
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.200]   three touchdowns and I
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.200]   would tell my kids, don't
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.200]   let off the pedal
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   let's put the pedal to the metal
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.200]   and crush the other team
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.200]   okay, I would have
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.200]   players come up to me
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.200]   my mic, just like coach
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.200]   come up to me and said
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.200]   coach A, could you like maybe give
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.200]   other team an opportunity to score
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.200]   uh, no
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:23.200]   okay
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:29.200]   I didn't believe in
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   everybody getting a trophy philosophy
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.200]   okay, I didn't believe in
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.200]   let's don't keep score because it's gonna
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.200]   hurt little kids, no no no
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.200]   right, trust me, when I was coaching
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.200]   like basketball, when he was
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.200]   my son was 7 or 8, okay
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.200]   it was a little league where you can't keep score
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   but you know who kept score? The kids did
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.200]   the kids
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.200]   I mean it's so sad when you live in a society
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.200]   where parents have become children
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.200]   and children have become kids, I mean
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   children have become adults
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   what kind of society we live in, right
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.200]   you could come in last place and still
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   get a trophy, what?
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   maybe you grew up that way, but that's not how
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   we grow up, right
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.200]   it doesn't do any good for the kids, right
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.200]   when they're losers, but you give a trophy
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:21.200]   okay, some of you
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.200]   might not offend them right now, but get over it
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:29.200]   because why, sometimes losing
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.200]   builds character
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.200]   if you don't teach kids how to lose, right
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.200]   how do you build character, how do they face life?
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:39.200]   think about that, right
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   you know what I'm saying is true
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   so one time
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.200]   we were gathering, we were playing
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.200]   playoffs now, okay, and you know how
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.200]   I got on my knees and I gathered all the kids
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.200]   and you know, you listen to the coach, right
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.200]   and I look to the kids, okay, listen, remember
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.200]   remember kids, right, God loves winners
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:51:05.200]   and some of you are offended by that too right now
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.200]   well get over it
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.200]   but it's true
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.200]   okay, we are
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   mortal conquerors
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.200]   and we're not winners because
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.200]   we're any better, because Christ
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.200]   is the winner, and Christ is victorious
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.200]   Christ conquered death
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.200]   Christ conquered Satan
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.200]   thus, through the power
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   of Christ, and by the grace of God
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.200]   and the spirit of God, we are mortal conquerors
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.200]   somebody say amen
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.200]   I know you ain't black, but you can say amen
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.200]   amen
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:39.200]   come on church
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.200]   this is great preaching, amen
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.200]   that's not a good preaching
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.200]   I'm just saying the truth of God
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.200]   the gospel of God
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.200]   that's something to get excited about
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.200]   we are mortal conquerors in Christ Jesus
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   see, nothing is separated from the love of God
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.200]   right, he says, for I am sure
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   I am confident that neither death
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.200]   nor life, nor angels, nor rulers
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.200]   nor anything present
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.200]   nor things to come, nor powers
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.200]   nor height, nor death, nor anything else
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.200]   and all creation will be able to
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.200]   separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.200]   our Lord, nothing will be able to
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.200]   separate us from the love of God
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.200]   this is what Paul is saying, not just dying
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.200]   and rotting flesh, nor sickness
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.200]   or cancer, not all the troubles
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.200]   and suffering in this life
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.200]   can separate us from the love of God
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.200]   no angels, no archangels, no demons
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.200]   Satan can't separate us from the love of God
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.200]   no kings, rulers, dictators
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.200]   or even Trump can separate us
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.200]   from the love of God
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.200]   not all these things, today, tomorrow
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   or for eternity, can't separate us
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.200]   from the love of God, there's no power on earth
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.200]   in heaven or in hell
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.200]   that can separate us from the love of God
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.200]   there's no place high enough
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.200]   low enough, wide enough
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.200]   that separates us from the love of God
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.200]   there's nothing in all creation
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.200]   even to the ends of the universe
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.200]   or in the darkest black hole
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.200]   can separate us from the love of God
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.200]   absolutely nothing, anyone
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.200]   can separate us
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.200]   nothing can separate us
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.200]   from the love of God in Christ Jesus
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.200]   our Lord
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   I'm tired
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.200]   I'm tired
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.200]   let me wrap this up
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.200]   there's a great hymn
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.200]   you know, one thing
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.200]   growing up in
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.200]   a reformed church as a kid
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.200]   we used to sing a lot of hymns
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.200]   and there's a hymn that I want to
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.200]   I'm not going to sing it to you
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.200]   because I don't want to be a stumbling block
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.200]   to y'all
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.200]   let me read this
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.200]   the lyrics of this hymn
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.200]   the hymn is called
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.200]   "Oh what wondrous love is this"
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.200]   it says "what wondrous love
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.200]   is this, oh my soul, what
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.200]   wondrous love is this that caused the
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.200]   Lord of bliss to bear
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.200]   the dreadful curse for my soul
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.200]   for my soul
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.200]   to bear the dreadful
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.200]   curse for my soul
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   when I was sinking down, sinking down
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.200]   when I was sinking down beneath
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.200]   God's righteous crown, Christ
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.200]   laid aside his crown
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.200]   for my soul, for my soul
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.200]   Christ laid down
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   his crown for my soul
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.200]   what wondrous love is this, oh
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.200]   what wondrous love is this
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.200]   oh my soul
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.200]   to lay aside his crown for my soul
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.200]   to lay down
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.200]   lay aside his crown for my soul
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.200]   in the last chorus
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   to God and to the
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.200]   Lamb I will sing
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   to God and to the Lamb
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.200]   who is the great I am
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.200]   while millions join the theme
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.200]   I will sing, I will sing
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.200]   while millions join
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.200]   the theme I will sing
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.200]   and all God's people said
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.200]   Amen
