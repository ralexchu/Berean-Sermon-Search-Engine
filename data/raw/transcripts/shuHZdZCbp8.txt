[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:50.920]   - Amen, good evening, everybody.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.600]   I would like to start off this service
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.080]   with a famous chapter, Exodus 15,
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.400]   when God delivered the people, his people,
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.040]   from the hands of the Egyptians.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.960]   It says, "Then Moses and the sons of Israel
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.800]   "sang this song to the Lord and said,
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.620]   "I will sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted.
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.100]   "The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.700]   "The Lord is my strength and song,
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.800]   "and he has become my salvation.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.320]   "This is my God, and I will praise him,
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.540]   "my Father's God, and I will extol him.
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.460]   "The Lord is a warrior.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.160]   "The Lord is his name.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.040]   "Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has cast into the sea,
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.700]   "and the choicest of his officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.220]   "The deeps cover them.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.220]   "They went down into the depths like a stone.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.700]   "Your right hand, O Lord, is majestic in power.
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.700]   "Your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemies,
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.320]   "and in the greatness of your excellence,
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.140]   "you overthrow those who rise up against you.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.620]   "You send forth your burning anger,
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.060]   "and it consumes them as chaff."
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.860]   Let's take a moment to pray together.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.760]   Our Heavenly Father, as we come gathered together
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.000]   to worship and to pray to you,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.360]   our prayer is, God, that through the work
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.440]   and ministry of your spirit,
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.360]   you would grant to us growing eyes of faith,
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.780]   hearts of faith, for the things that we read,
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.840]   the things that we believe would be so real
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.820]   as though we saw it with our physical eyes.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.080]   We pray, Father God, that the conviction that we had,
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.600]   that you are powerful far above and beyond everything else,
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.500]   that just as we sung, you are more beautiful,
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.980]   more worthy, and holier than anything that we could fathom.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.880]   I pray, Father God, that when we see you as such,
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.520]   we would respond in kind.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.440]   We thank you for this evening.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.880]   It's in Christ's name, amen.

[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.120]   (church bell ringing)
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:42.600]   Okay, please turn your Bible over to Exodus chapter 15.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.880]   And again, it's such a familiar passage,
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.120]   but it cannot be overstated,
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.600]   that the Exodus account is a glorious,
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.720]   glorious wonder of God.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   And it goes down in history,
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.120]   whereas in the Old Testament,
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.760]   if the people of God are thinking,
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.680]   give me the prime example of deliverance,
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.320]   this is the story that is told
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.080]   to the generations upon generations.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.080]   And then, the song that we're looking at in chapter 15,
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.200]   is immediately upon that deliverance.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.520]   We're not talking about reflecting and reminiscing of old,
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.000]   but rather then and there by the sea,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.640]   this is a song famously known as the Song of Moses.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.600]   And it's the song given as a worshipful act to God.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.040]   And for us to appreciate it,
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.960]   we've gotta do the imagination.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.560]   Visualize you being there.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.000]   I want you to do your best to imagine your worst nightmare.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.360]   You know the ones where somebody's chasing you.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.200]   You know the ones when you're falling deep,
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.100]   deep down into a dark pit.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.200]   You know the ones where if you're startled,
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.520]   you know, abruptly from that kind of nightmare,
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.820]   just in cold sweat, that's you running.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.120]   Why?
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   Because the scripture accounts that the Egyptians
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.060]   who enslaved God's people were chasing them
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.640]   with 600 chariots.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.200]   Can you imagine that?
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.640]   I want you to think about more than every single person
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.540]   in this room all chasing after you, one single person.
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.720]   And in order to modernize it,
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.220]   imagine that all of them are riding trucks.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.480]   They've got guns in their cars, shotguns, AKs,
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.120]   whatever it may be, and they're all chasing you,
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.400]   and you're running for your life.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.040]   This is the scene.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.900]   And then, you know what makes the scene
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.220]   even more scarier sometimes?
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.800]   It's not so much just the fact that the enemy
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.640]   is a million times faster than you
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.320]   because you're on foot with your luggage,
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.280]   and they're on chariots.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.320]   A lot of times, things get scarier
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.520]   when the people around you are filled with fear,
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.400]   and they start losing it, and they start saying stuff
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.920]   they shouldn't be saying, when the people around you
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.480]   are just filled with terror in their heart.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.480]   In Exodus 14, this is what the account says.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.920]   Exodus 14, verses 10 through 14.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:16.000]   As Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel looked,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.860]   and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.160]   So they became very frightened.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.520]   So the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord,
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.160]   and they started to lose it.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.480]   Verse 11, then they said to Moses,
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.760]   is it because there were no graves in Egypt
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.100]   that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness?
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.680]   Why have you dealt with us in this way,
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.640]   bringing us out of Egypt?
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.660]   Is this not the word we spoke to you in Egypt,
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.920]   saying, leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.020]   For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.200]   than to die in the wilderness.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.240]   Yikes.
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:56.980]   Could you be strong, seeing the dust of smoke,
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.340]   the thunder sound of hooves,
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.020]   and then the guys who are next to you
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:04.840]   who are supposed to be older, or whatever it may be,
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.300]   just completely filled with terror
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.840]   to the degree that they would stay,
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.220]   ridiculous things like this?
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.180]   Verse 13, but Moses said to the people,
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:18.180]   do not fear, stand by and see the salvation of the Lord,
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:22.340]   which he will accomplish for you today.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.680]   For the Egyptians whom you have seen today,
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.580]   you will never see them again forever.
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.760]   Why?
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:33.580]   The Lord will fight for you while you keep silent.
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.420]   Wow.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.580]   Isn't that incredible?
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.580]   They're just screaming like, oh my gosh, we should go back.
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.780]   Oh my gosh, let's just surrender.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:43.820]   And Moses sits there and says,
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.060]   you know what the word of the Lord is?
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.200]   Stay quiet, watch me.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.540]   What a mic drop.
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.860]   So I want you to imagine you hearing those words, right?
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.780]   Moses saying to you, just you stay quiet and watch,
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.320]   and you'll never see these fools again.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.500]   And you may be thinking, are you crazy?
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.620]   And just then, you see fire,
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.260]   you see the clouds that's been guiding you,
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.740]   and as the story goes, Moses does what God commands,
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.740]   and boom, the sea opens up,
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.320]   and you see just the wall of water.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.940]   You're walking through what used to be right there,
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.540]   the ocean, or the sea.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.980]   And the fire comes and confuses them,
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.700]   and again, to make the story shorter a bit,
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.020]   'cause we don't have all that time,
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.420]   as you know, God commands and it swallows up the soldier,
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.780]   but I want you to picture this.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.540]   If you were a young man,
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.420]   maybe you were like high school age,
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.140]   and you're watching all this,
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:43.180]   and once you cross, and it says in the morning,
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.140]   so they walk through the night,
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.060]   and in the morning, what you see is the waters
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.900]   just rush back to fill the void,
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.500]   and all the people are just,
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.260]   as soon as it happens, obviously,
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.040]   first you hear screams, and then nothing.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.060]   All you hear is water.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.260]   One of the interesting things about the story
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.460]   is that I just thought that this massive amounts of water
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:08.460]   buried them, but it says actually a bunch of their bodies
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.900]   came to the sea, and they saw them, the deceased,
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.100]   right before their feet.
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:18.100]   What a terrifying, what a jaw-dropping,
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.540]   I don't think I would be able to say a word.
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.100]   Could you?
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.540]   Even though they were enemies,
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.660]   even though they were the oppressors,
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.580]   their lifeless bodies are there.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.900]   What would you do?
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:35.220]   Well, strangely enough, this portion of the text
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:39.580]   that we are in, Moses breaks out in song of worship.
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:42.820]   He sees the mighty hand of God,
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.140]   and in chapter 15, verse one, he says,
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.420]   Moses and the sons of Israel, so it wasn't just him,
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:50.260]   but everybody sang the song to the Lord and said,
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.860]   I will sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted,
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.220]   the horse and its rider, he hurled into the sea,
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.860]   and after he sings the song with all the men,
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.460]   it seems like the ladies joined on.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.100]   They continued the celebration.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.460]   Verse 20 says, Miriam and the prophetess,
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.940]   Aaron's sister, took the timbrel in her hand,
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.860]   and all the women went out after her with timbrels
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.140]   and were dancing, and Miriam said,
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.820]   sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted,
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.280]   the horse and its rider, he has hurled into the sea.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.580]   He has hurled into the sea.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:28.340]   And so, we take a moment to remind ourselves,
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:33.340]   wow, the Lord God has shown and proven himself
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.900]   to be so powerful.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.620]   The people of God, when they saw,
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.540]   could do nothing but react with dancing,
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.520]   with shouts of joy, and singing.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.820]   For us, then, we remember that our worship
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.540]   is a reaction to us seeing the glory of God.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:53.260]   Our worship is reactionary.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:57.900]   Our singing, our emotions, it's all reactionary.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.380]   And just as a nation of Israel,
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.840]   they saw the power which the Lord used
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.100]   against the Egyptians, they're filled with fear,
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.980]   they're filled with joy, and they believe
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.860]   that it is the natural process for us.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.060]   So then, we ask this question.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:15.900]   Are any of you guys in a state
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.820]   where you come to worship and something just feels old?
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:24.100]   Are we ever in a state where we come to worship
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.440]   and we start to have this thought,
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.140]   like, I'm not sure if I'm getting anything out of it?
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:32.300]   Do we come into worship and sometimes we have a situation
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.200]   where it's an age-old kind of problem?
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.380]   When I say age-old, it was one of the first sins.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.900]   If you recall back between Cain and Abel,
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.580]   what was Cain's sin?
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:47.960]   He just kind of said, "Meh."
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.800]   Right?
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.980]   There wasn't anything in it for them.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:56.420]   The great fallen condition that tainted our worship
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.900]   from long ago was we failed to see
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.940]   the incredible glory of God,
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.820]   and when we come into worship, it's kind of like,
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:05.660]   am I getting anything out of it?
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.340]   And so, once we start to feel like,
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.340]   is this moving me in any way?
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.060]   Is this inspiring to me?
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:16.260]   Then this is when all kinds of stuff like playing church,
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.340]   doing it just out of tradition, it's like, you know,
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.900]   my parents did it, this is the way my parents
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.280]   and my father and the church does it,
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.500]   or we turn into some kind of weird superstition.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.420]   If I continue to give God worship,
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.860]   I know eventually he's going to bless me.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:36.040]   May it never be that we grow tired
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.880]   of giving praises and worship to this powerful God, amen?
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.360]   Today, I want to take a look at this portion.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.200]   I'm going to run through it pretty quickly.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.920]   For us to visualize God in this story
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.140]   so that we would be inspired for greater worship,
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.840]   to visualize God, and how does it present it to us?
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:59.840]   How did God use this specific case-in-point deliverance
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.280]   so that he would reveal himself to be powerful?
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.640]   Take a look at verse two.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.420]   Chapter 15, verse two, it says,
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.160]   "The Lord is my strength and song,
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.800]   "and has become my salvation.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.100]   "This is my God, and I will praise him,
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.420]   "my Father's God, and I will extol him.
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.780]   "The Lord is a warrior.
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.760]   "The Lord is his name.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.680]   "Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has cast into the sea,
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.420]   "and the choices of his officers
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:29.580]   "to drown into the Red Sea, the deeps cover them.
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:34.400]   "They went down into the depths like a stone."
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.000]   Interesting, if we were there on the shore,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.420]   and all of a sudden, Moses is breaking off into song,
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.420]   we're thinking, whoa, what are you doing?
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.000]   And what Moses is going to say is,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.200]   I am reacting to the fact that, look,
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:52.100]   God is a warrior, and he's absolutely victorious.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.500]   You know what's really interesting is,
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.460]   the ESV captures it in a different way.
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.960]   It says, "God is a man of war."
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:05.920]   Whoa, question, when we think about God,
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.640]   we have so many titles, so many depictions
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.600]   and perspectives about God.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.960]   Among them, is it, this is a warrior.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.520]   Now, I want you to know that sometimes,
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.920]   when I sit and I do one of these Old Testament studies,
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.440]   and I'm trying to imagine, I actually sit there,
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.840]   and I'm like, hmm, the way I think of a warrior
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.960]   is he's gotta have army fatigue,
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.740]   you know, the camouflage, and I think, no, no, no,
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.880]   God doesn't need camouflage, you know, like,
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.960]   so what if they see him?
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.240]   He wants to be seen, okay?
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.840]   And it's like, oh, and then he's got the helmet.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.680]   It's like, oh, wait a minute,
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.280]   he doesn't need helmet either, right?
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.640]   And he's got this big gun with a scope on it,
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.600]   and all that kind of stuff, it's like, wait a minute.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.320]   How do we perceive of God, the scripture is telling us,
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.320]   do you see the way God is here presented to his people,
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.360]   primarily as a man of victory and war?
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.800]   If you turn to Revelations chapter 19,
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.280]   if we're going to see God as a warrior,
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.840]   we also want to see Christ as a warrior,
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.400]   and it's appropriate for us to get a little afraid.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.160]   This is a famous passage, Revelations chapter 19.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:17.160]   It says, "I saw heaven open, and behold, a white horse,
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.960]   "and he who sat on it called Faithful and True,
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:24.800]   "and in righteousness he judges and wages war."
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.320]   Do you see that?
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.960]   "He wages war, his eyes are flame of fire,
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.000]   "and his head are many diadems,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.320]   "and he has a name written on him
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.800]   "which no one knows except himself.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.520]   "He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood,
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.320]   "and his name is called the Word of God.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.840]   "The armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen,
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.600]   "white and clean, were following him on white horses.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.360]   "From his mouth comes a sharp sword,
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.800]   "so that with it he may strike down the nations.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.880]   "He will rule them with a rod of iron.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.760]   "He treads on the winepress
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:00.680]   "of the fierce wrath of God the Almighty.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.720]   "And on his robe and on his thigh,
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:07.720]   "he has a name written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords."
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.840]   You've heard that before, yes?
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.320]   You've probably even seen people try to draw it.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.440]   It looks ridiculous.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:19.640]   But I want to remind you, that picture of Jesus Christ,
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.160]   I believe, is a closer reality to us.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.960]   I'm just talking about time.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.840]   Aren't we now in the last hour?
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.480]   Aren't we now closer to the time when he will return?
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.680]   Aren't we now waiting and anticipating this picture?
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.320]   Were you waiting for somebody who had the towel on his arm,
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.680]   or were you waiting for somebody that looks like this?
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.000]   We're waiting for the warrior, amen?
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.920]   And then so when we picture Christ that way,
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.080]   we should be worshiping, that's you.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.400]   You're going to be almighty, all-powerful.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.800]   You're gonna be filled with wrath,
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.440]   and anybody who stands in your way
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.000]   is gonna get destroyed, they're gonna get leveled.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.520]   You know, part of the reason why,
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.560]   or not part of the reason,
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.320]   one of the points more recently
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.000]   that I've been just fixated on,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.080]   and if you hear my preaching,
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.000]   you've probably heard me mention it many times.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.520]   I am just astounded, I am in worship, just in awe,
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.920]   of the perfections of the various facets of God,
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.480]   namely the fact that he is both simultaneously
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.040]   incredibly strict, severe, vengeful, and wrathful,
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:33.920]   while at the same time perfectly kind and merciful, yes?
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:38.360]   Another passage from Revelations chapter six, it says this.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.480]   Then the kings of the earth, and the great men,
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.400]   and the commanders, and the rich, and the strong,
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.400]   and every slave and free man hid themselves in the caves,
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.320]   and among the rocks of the mountains,
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.560]   and they said to the mountains and to the rocks,
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.640]   fall on us, and hide us from the presence of him
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:58.640]   who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the lion.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.240]   No, it says the wrath of the lamb,
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.480]   for the great day of their wrath has come,
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.560]   and who is able to stand?
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.560]   Gospel truth for us is we were standing,
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:14.200]   if Christ is gonna come, mighty on a white horse,
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.920]   with fire coming out of his eyes,
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.800]   we were standing in rebellion about to face him.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:25.240]   Gospel truth is, but instead of being against us,
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.360]   he is gonna be for us to deliver us.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.080]   What an amazing, amazing truth.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.120]   And the reason why I'm going at this is because
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.520]   in the eyes of the saints of old, eyes of Moses,
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.480]   he is looking at the wrath of God,
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.440]   he is literally looking at death and destruction,
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:48.440]   and saying, God, I worship you, you're exalted,
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.200]   and I want us to feel the same.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:56.200]   A strange mixture in our heart of fear, wonder, terror,
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.680]   but so much relief.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.120]   This God is for me.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.520]   Do you know who's in my corner?
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.520]   Do you know who is my strength?
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.400]   Do you know who fights for me?
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.800]   I don't even have to say a word,
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.360]   he asked us to be quiet.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:18.000]   God Almighty, he is the warrior, amen?
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.760]   And so the next bits of the passage, all it's doing,
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.040]   and the song is just reiterating,
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.160]   do you understand how powerful he is?
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.640]   Do you understand what a warrior he is?
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.240]   Do you understand how secure and sure his victory is?
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.520]   Take a look over at verse six through 10.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.720]   In verse six through 10, I call it,
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:40.480]   this is God versus anyone and everyone.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.480]   God versus any and all.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.600]   God is so amazing, let the greatest come from the world,
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.560]   and he's dead.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.200]   The God is so amazing, let every single man
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.800]   come against God, and they're dead.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.640]   Take a look.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.080]   It says, your right hand, O Lord, is majestic in power.
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.720]   Your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemy,
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.480]   and in the greatness of your excellence,
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.360]   you overthrow those who rise up against you.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.160]   You send forth your burning anger,
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.440]   and it consumes them as chaff.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.880]   The blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.480]   The flowing water stood up like a heap.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.480]   The deeps were congealed, and the hearts of the sea,
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.280]   and the enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake,
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.360]   I will divide the spoil.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.560]   My desire shall be gratified against them.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.760]   I will drop my sword, my hand will destroy them.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.760]   You blew with your wind, and the sea covered them.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:35.760]   They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.680]   You know, a lot of us, we geek out over certain things.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.960]   Some of you guys are like experts with tech,
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.880]   and you're like, oh my gosh, do you understand
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.000]   how powerful this M1 chip is, or whatever chip it is now?
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.760]   Do you understand what the retina thingy
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.080]   and all this kind of stuff?
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.240]   Well, back in the day, I actually really, really liked
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.040]   watching boxing, and I'll be like, oh my gosh,
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.200]   did you see that punch to the liver?
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.640]   Do you see that uppercut?
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.520]   Every single punch is landing.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.700]   That's, to me, how this passage sounds.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.000]   And I want every single one of us to know,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.600]   part of our worship sounds like that.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.200]   It's like, did you see, did you see how God,
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.720]   exact thing he said, came to be exactly as he said,
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.960]   when he said it, and how he said it?
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.060]   Oh my gosh, every jab, every hook, every punch,
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:24.240]   landing square in the face.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.280]   Question.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:32.480]   If you are coming to worship, and you're not worshiping,
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.700]   it is because you are not seeing God this way.
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:40.540]   Why are you not impressed with this warrior?
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.060]   Why are you not impressed with God?
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:45.140]   What is keeping you so distracted?
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.340]   And I wanna give this challenge.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.500]   If you, during your whole week, have been staring at things
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.300]   that are so awesome, tech-wise, car-wise,
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.980]   position-wise, job-wise, and you've just been marveling
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.620]   at the works of man, and then you come to church,
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.300]   and you're like, meh, it's 'cause you don't see it
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.700]   with your physical eyes.
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.300]   No wonder you're not impressed.
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.860]   If you, throughout your whole week,
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.500]   you don't rely on God, you don't pray,
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.660]   you don't read his word, you've just been working hard,
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:08.780]   you've been putting in the hours,
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.980]   and you're doing a great job, you come to worship,
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.380]   and you're like, meh, why?
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.780]   Because you're very much impressed with yourself.
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:20.620]   Our worship is simply being in awe,
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.740]   and I want us to feel that.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.980]   Next portion, in verse 11 through 16, he says,
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.620]   who is like you among the gods, O Lord?
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.740]   Who is like you, majestic in holiness,
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.580]   awesome in praises, working wonders?
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.500]   You stretched out your hand, the earth swallowed them,
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.420]   and in your loving kindness, you have led the people
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.380]   whom you have redeemed, in your strength,
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.500]   you have guided them to your holy habitation.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.780]   This is amazing.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:53.780]   Every true Christian knows how to be in wonder of God,
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:56.460]   who has brought us to his dwelling.
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.940]   We are amazed because we think, God,
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.340]   you've been gracious to me?
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:05.540]   You wanna be a part of my life?
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.780]   You want me with you?
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:10.520]   You've offered us adoption?
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.300]   We're constantly in wonder.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.020]   Verse 14 through 16, it says,
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:16.680]   the peoples have heard, they tremble,
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.420]   anguish has gripped the inhabitants of Philistia.
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.720]   Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed,
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.300]   the leaders of Moab trembling grips them.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.300]   All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.400]   Terror, dread fall upon them.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.520]   By the greatness of your arm,
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.480]   they are motionless as stone.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.200]   Motionless as stone.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.760]   He's just talking about the effect of God's greatness,
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.280]   that if you truly see him, there's gonna be a healthy fear.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.080]   There's gonna be a healthy fear.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.400]   And then finally, not only is there wonder,
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.360]   not only is there fear, but ultimately for us,
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.720]   when we see the power of God,
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.100]   we're filled with absolute hope.
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:59.600]   Verse 16, it says, until your people have passed over,
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:03.100]   O Lord, until the people pass over whom you have purchased,
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.760]   you will bring them and plant them
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.680]   in the mountain of your inheritance.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.520]   The place, O Lord, which you have made for your dwelling,
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.760]   the sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands have established.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.520]   The Lord shall reign forever and ever.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.640]   For the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.080]   and his horsemen went into the sea,
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.120]   and the Lord brought back the waters of the sea on them.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.440]   But the sons of Israel walked on dry land
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.900]   through the midst of the sea.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.300]   What is this?
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.360]   He is summarizing and requenting what just happened,
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.480]   but he knows God is 100% faithful
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.560]   and capable of accomplishing his plan.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.920]   Earlier in the song, he says,
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.260]   Lord, you're my God, I'm gonna worship you.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.800]   You are my Father's God, I'm gonna worship you.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.360]   It is totally good that he, Moses,
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.120]   sees God's promises to the forefathers,
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:55.540]   God's promises to patriarchs are gonna come true
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.880]   according to the covenant.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.260]   Why?
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:02.240]   Because God is powerful to keep his word.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.740]   God is faithful to keep his promise,
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.400]   and that is our future hope.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:12.240]   So, I want us to take a moment to turn to Psalm 106,
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.980]   and then I read eight verses.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.100]   In hindsight, looking back,
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:23.820]   several hundred years pass since the actual time of Exodus
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:25.220]   to the writing of the psalm.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.000]   Okay?
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.160]   In looking back then, what's the perspective?
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.340]   What's the attitude?
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:34.300]   And in many ways, it's the exact same.
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.060]   But there is a convicting word for us here,
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:39.860]   so I want us to look, Psalm 106, starting from verse one.
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.140]   Praise the Lord, oh, give thanks to the Lord,
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:46.700]   for he is good, for his lovingkindness is everlasting.
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.500]   Who can speak of the mighty deeds of the Lord,
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.860]   or can show forth all his praise?
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.180]   How blessed are those who keep justice,
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.980]   who practice righteousness at all times.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.860]   Remember me, oh Lord, in your favor towards your people.
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:01.540]   Visit me with your salvation,
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:04.100]   that I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones,
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.620]   that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:10.480]   that I may glory with your inheritance.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.320]   We have sinned like our fathers.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.860]   Look at this.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.860]   We have committed iniquity.
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.460]   We have behaved wickedly.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:24.100]   For our fathers in Egypt did not understand your wonders.
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:27.100]   They did not remember your abundant kindness,
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:30.140]   but rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:33.600]   Nevertheless, he saved them for the sake of his name,
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.020]   that he might make his power known.
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:38.540]   Whoa.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.780]   Take a look at that passage,
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.140]   and I want to give glory to God.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:46.580]   Did God not know that the people would set up
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:49.040]   a golden calf just shortly after?
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.180]   Did God not know that actually,
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.840]   from the moment he sent Moses,
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.240]   people were like, who the heck are you?
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.540]   Did God not know that the people were like,
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.540]   hey, why are you making it harder for us?
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:03.440]   Now they want us to make more bricks without straw.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.620]   Did God not know that the people would lose heart
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.940]   and be like, oh my gosh, we should have just died in Egypt.
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:12.680]   Did God not know that by the sea,
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.100]   just shortly after, they were like, wow,
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.300]   and everybody was dancing with tambourine,
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.600]   and woo, that they would sin against him?
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:24.620]   Praise God.
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:27.880]   Praise God he is merciful,
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.520]   but also praise God that he works and operates
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.200]   for his glory and for his name, amen?
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.240]   Praise God in this passage, it says,
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.160]   God is holy, and for his own name he accomplished
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.160]   so that he might make his glory known,
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:45.120]   and he is shining it.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:48.000]   Then shame on us if we ever come into worship,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.600]   and it's like, I don't know, this stuff's getting old.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.440]   What?
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.300]   Then clearly there's some strange blindness,
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:58.960]   and something deeper is happening with our hearts.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:03.720]   Let us know that this song of Moses is a song for us.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:06.740]   When we believe God to be victorious,
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.260]   when we believe God to be mighty,
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.780]   and when we believe God to be the warrior,
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.580]   we're gonna be led to worship.
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:14.420]   Let's pray.
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:24.400]   Lord, I truly ask God that you would help us
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.000]   not to walk this life by sight.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.820]   We see other people's talents and skills
[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:35.500]   and the product of their hands, and we get so impressed.
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:40.040]   Lord, I pray God you would forgive us for that,
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.100]   because we know better.
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.440]   Lord, you're the God who created everything,
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.400]   and you're the God who gave us breath,
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.580]   and you are so powerful.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:52.040]   Even if all, however many billions of people
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.700]   are on this earth rose up against you,
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:58.060]   with one word, you would make all of them fall.
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:02.720]   I pray, Lord, that you would help us just to be in wonder.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.860]   And Lord God, even if we don't sing,
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:07.500]   but let us in our reaction of prayer,
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.980]   let us in our reaction of submission,
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:13.980]   let us in our reaction of fear and hope,
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:18.080]   let all these things, Father God, rise to you from our faith.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.880]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.160]   For the remainder of the evening,
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.540]   we're gonna have just extended time of prayer,
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:27.560]   but we're just going to move in three sections.
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:31.800]   I wanna first give you guys the time to do personal prayer.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:35.200]   So I'm gonna put up to several points for you
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:38.080]   if you just wanna react and you wanna just respond,
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:41.080]   I mean, with just your own heart to God,
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.620]   with repentance, with more trust.
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:46.320]   Go ahead and do that, and after 10 minutes,
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.840]   we'll then move to corporate prayer,
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.600]   and at the end, we'll finish off
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.960]   with praying for one another.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.320]   Go ahead and take time now for extended prayer.

[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:19.920]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.080]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:44.080]   (gentle piano music continues)

[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:17.120]   (gentle piano music continues)

[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:52.960]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.960]   - Okay, allow me to close that portion off in prayer.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.960]   Heavenly Father, just lifting up another word
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.120]   as a congregation, Lord, we do ask that by your Spirit,
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.440]   we will experience your power on a regular basis.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:25.040]   Lord, we ask that we would experience your Spirit
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:29.280]   just moving so deeply by way of conviction and faith.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:32.160]   And then Lord, help us to make sure
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.080]   that we are following you to the degree
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.480]   that we would experience that power,
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.960]   that we would risk our comforts and well-being
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.760]   for your kingdom to experience that power.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.080]   By way of simple obedience, when things seem impossible,
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:49.020]   or even trusting in you when we're most deeply hurt,
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:52.160]   help us, Father God, to experience your power in our lives.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.080]   We know, Lord God, that you are faithful and good.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.620]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:59.880]   At this time, we'll go to the next portion
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.720]   where there is a lot of things happening at church.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:06.680]   As you know, the Korea team is just wrapping up.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.800]   Today was the last day of an English camp
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.240]   that they've been running.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.000]   From some of their posts and messages,
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.920]   it sounds like they had a really amazing time,
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.520]   so let's pray that God would use
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.040]   every single one of those conversations,
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.000]   all the informal downtime, and then let's pray
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.760]   that the team stays then ready, in focus and sober,
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.760]   so that they can maximize all the time that they have.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.920]   This month, as you guys know,
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.940]   there's been a lot of graduations for college students,
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.380]   for high school students.
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:37.600]   Let's pray that as they're going to experience
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.440]   a lot of changes, and therefore challenges,
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.640]   that they would have both a purposeful,
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.400]   intentional time, especially in the summer.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.120]   Soon, just in two, three weeks,
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.960]   we're gonna be having VBS, and there's been,
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.220]   just for months, a lot of preparation that's gone into that.
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:57.280]   I just put grace on volunteers.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:00.840]   There's been, there's over like 90 to 100 volunteers.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.440]   Let's pray that all the volunteers,
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.880]   no matter what they're doing,
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:08.320]   they are really focused in on ministering to the students
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:11.880]   and maximizing whatever opportunity they have,
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.160]   but more so, too, when we think about the loss
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.840]   for our church, we're thinking,
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.720]   there are so many young students, so many children,
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.860]   and we're desperately praying for their salvation,
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:24.920]   joining in the parents, pleading to God, save their souls.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.760]   We also have an EV and gospel,
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.680]   EV outing and gospel night.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.400]   So Saturday, we're gonna be going at 1 p.m.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.120]   out to the various malls.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.320]   Please pray just for fruitful conversations,
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.160]   and then Wednesday, 7/10, there's going to be
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:44.600]   an evening gospel presentation, and then also Q&A.
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.280]   Let's ask that God will cause those things to be fruitful.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.460]   Okay, please go ahead and pray for the next 10 minutes.

[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:31.940]   and take time to pray for one another.
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:34.160]   And in about 10 to 15 minutes,

[01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:18.480]   Father, we're thankful, Lord God,
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:21.480]   that you gathered your church to come and pray
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:24.480]   and sing these songs of worship to you.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.480]   As we depart, I pray, Lord God,
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:29.480]   that you remind us just the importance
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:34.480]   of our personal times of prayer, devotions,
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:36.480]   that our love for you may only grow, Lord God,
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:39.480]   because we can reflect on the grace
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:42.480]   that you continually poured out to us,
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:45.480]   that we can reflect on who you are.
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:49.480]   You are a thrice holy God who has been so gracious to us.
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:52.480]   So I pray, Lord God, that as we pray for many things,
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:57.480]   from personal topics to church things going on,
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:59.480]   I pray, Lord God, that you help us, Lord God,
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:01.480]   to continue to be a praying church,
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:04.480]   that we may not rely on our own abilities,
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:07.480]   our own strengths, but we may gain
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:10.480]   just spiritual power and strength
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:14.480]   through our devotion, Lord God, to you and through prayer.
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:18.480]   So be with us, Lord God, as we continue, Lord God,
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:21.480]   seeking you, and give us the strength that we need.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.480]   It's in Christ that we pray.
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:23.480]   Amen.
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:24.480]   Good night.
