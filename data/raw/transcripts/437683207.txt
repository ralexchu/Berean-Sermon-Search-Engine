[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   Hi, my name's Hannah. I'm married to Matt Chong and we have currently two boys, Toby
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:16.120]   and Adam. Growing up, I struggled constantly with insecurity and feelings of worthlessness.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.080]   A large part of that was due to the fact that my dad was not in my life for the most of
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:29.640]   my childhood. His absence made me question my worth and led me to seek affirmation and
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:39.400]   love in other things. I grew angry and bitter and hated being at home where it was a constant
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.920]   reminder of the things I did not have and the struggles my mom, my brother, and I faced.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.920]   In junior high, I started attending a church where I heard for the first time that God
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.480]   loved me. Hearing that gave me such an emotional response and I really clung to that message
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.920]   and tried to maintain that emotional high however I could. The church was highly charismatic
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.880]   and the really loud and intense worship nights and the scripture passages emphasizing God's
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.120]   love fed into those feelings. I got really involved and also got baptized but didn't
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.560]   understand the role of my own sins in the gospel nor did I exhibit any remorse leading
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.720]   to repentance and change in my own life. I was one person at church, happy and praising
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.480]   the Lord and then at home angry, bitter, and mean to my own family. I was told over and
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.720]   over that God loved me and he accepted me but despite how good I would feel initially,
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.740]   these emotions didn't have true substance based on actual scripture or an understanding
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.880]   of the need for repentance. Eventually, as all emotions do, the feelings would fade and
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.620]   I was still the same insecure, bitter, angry person who struggled with feelings of worthlessness.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.100]   In college, I attended a completely different type of church. It was reformed, Presbyterian,
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.200]   and emphasized teaching the Bible and the gospel. It was eye-opening to see the Bible
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.420]   presented that way and how everything pointed to Christ and again, I became really involved
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.080]   at the church, learning about Tulip, going through catechism, small groups, and even
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.540]   leading groups myself. But while my head was being filled with knowledge, it made absolutely
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.640]   no impact in my personal life. I didn't connect the fact that my sins were the reason I needed
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.180]   the gospel and a savior in the first place. I lived such a hypocritical life, claiming
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.280]   that I understood what the Bible said and yet showing no fruit. I was still angry and
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.000]   bitter, pretty much neglected my family and using school and work as an excuse to not
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.440]   visit home. Trying to fill the void, I turned to relationships. With no regard for consequences,
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.880]   I did whatever I could to win their affections. I soaked it in whenever they reciprocated
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.320]   and became utterly devastated when they didn't. And after all these relationships eventually
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.440]   ended, I was again left with the same emptiness, the same sins, and the same feeling of worthlessness.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.900]   After I moved back from San Diego, I started to attend Berean and I remember listening
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.800]   to Pastor Peter preach the first Sunday I visited. And I heard for the first time a
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.480]   message that explained that God was holy. His standard was perfection and I was a depraved
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.320]   sinner. It dawned on me that this was the aspect of the gospel message I had missed
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.680]   completely. Week after week, I learned that the main character of the story was not me,
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.000]   but God. I learned that my sins were not small or harmless, but instead were giant stains
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.560]   that I had no hope of washing away on my own. Suddenly, things started to fall into place.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.560]   Why I wasn't able to find satisfaction or peace in all these other things I pursued,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.880]   even within the church. My motives and desires were all led by my own selfishness to attain
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.960]   the things that I wanted, yet the biggest issue I needed to deal with was the fact that
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.080]   I was a sinner in need of forgiveness and reconciliation with my creator and God. God
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.720]   opened my eyes to recognize that yes, I was unworthy. I was completely unworthy of receiving
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.840]   anything from God but wrath. Everything I did was tainted with sin, but he in his great
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.120]   compassion and mercy and love chose to send his very own son to become sin on my behalf
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.240]   so that I could be reconciled to him. I had fought so hard to feel loved and accepted
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:06.160]   by whatever means necessary. But now I know that I can rest in my identity as God's own
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:14.200]   child. The rock of my salvation is the Lord and I now live with freedom knowing that my
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.560]   sins are forgiven and I have been reconciled with my God. I can now live with the purpose
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.200]   for which I was created, to glorify and honor God in all that I do. I have been crucified
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.800]   with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.160]   live in the flesh, I live by faith in the son of God who loved me and gave himself up
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.000]   for me. Galatians 2.20. Even more, God has helped me to see how he uses all things for
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.720]   the good of those who love him, including the hurt I had with my dad and my past. He
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.760]   truly wastes nothing and everything he ordains in my life is for the purpose of my sanctification
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.960]   and for his glory. He who did not spare his own son but delivered him over for us all,
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.920]   how will he not freely give us all things? Romans 8.32. I still remember reading the
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.240]   parable of the hidden treasure and I read it as if with new eyes. From Matthew 13.44
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.840]   it says, "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.440]   found and hid again, and from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.720]   that field." I truly understand what the parable is saying, that once the gospel has
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.840]   been revealed to someone, there is nothing too big to sacrifice in order to gain it,
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.560]   including my very own life. Indeed, I know that I was called to die and to be resurrected
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.920]   to new life in Christ. Philippians 3.7-11. But whatever things were gained to me, those
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.120]   things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ. More than that, I count all things
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.720]   to be in loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.880]   I have suffered the loss of all things, but count them but rubbish, so that I may gain
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.000]   Christ and may be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.520]   law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.000]   the basis of faith, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.440]   of his sufferings, being conformed to his death in order that I may attain to the resurrection
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.440]   from the dead.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:37.440]   Hannah, thank you for sharing your testimony with us. As we participate in this back,
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.760]   we recognize that as you enter the water, symbolize your union with Christ's death.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.480]   As you come out of the water, symbolize your union with Christ's resurrection. I baptize
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.600]   you now in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
