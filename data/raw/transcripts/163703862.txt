[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960]   Why don't we turn our Bibles to Romans chapter 4 and I'll be reading from verse 9 through
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.960]   12.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.400]   Romans chapter 4 verses 9 through 12.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.400]   Is this blessing then only for the circumcised or also for the uncircumcised?
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.120]   We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.560]   How then was it counted to him?
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.920]   Was it before or after he had been circumcised?
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.260]   It was not after but before he was circumcised.
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.000]   He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.320]   while he was still uncircumcised.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.620]   The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.920]   so that righteousness would be counted to them as well and to make him the father of
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.320]   the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.440]   faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.000]   Let's pray.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.160]   Heavenly Father we entrust this time to you asking Lord God for your grace for your Holy
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.760]   Spirit to lead and guide us.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.240]   We pray that our time may be a pleasing sacrifice.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.440]   It would be worship, it would be a time that we offer more than just our flesh but our
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.160]   very souls and our spirit that an overflow of thankfulness Lord God would cause us to
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.120]   give you what you deserve.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.680]   And so we pray for your grace this morning in Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.240]   You know as you know I was out of the country for a couple of weeks and I know it's not
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.200]   a long period of time but it felt like I was out forever.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.240]   I was up at a retreat out in Korea and I was there for a bit and then I went to China to
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.320]   visit our team and I got sick while I was there.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.040]   I got sick before I went but I got sick especially when I was in China and then I visited Hong
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.200]   Kong for a few hours on the way out and so I was able to fellowship with our brother
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   Peter and then we came back and then I didn't preach last Sunday.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.520]   The good thing I didn't because again I wasn't feeling that well coming back and you know
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.080]   one thing I noticed a rare opportunity that I get to sit with my wife and I was sitting
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.520]   in the back during worship and I read something really interesting this week and basically
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.200]   a heart surgeon was talking about how some people who get surgery on their heart that
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.080]   after the surgery they can actually hear their heartbeat for a period and they said that
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.320]   the reason why is because any kind of shift any kind of you know like a minuscule change
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.240]   in the heartbeat the brain is able to pick it up for a period and it takes a while you
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.640]   know whether it takes days or weeks sometimes and then your brain just kind of adjusts and
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.200]   then you stop hearing it you know and I was thinking about how you know when we first
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.800]   moved into this place our greatest concern was the airplanes you know what I mean are
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.640]   we going to be able to have worship and we're going to have to stop preaching when the airplanes
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.920]   go by and I noticed that I only think about it now when we have new people come to church
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.760]   and it's like oh doesn't that bother you it's like oh that's right we're next to an airport
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.680]   you know so we've all I mean if you've been here for a while we've all just kind of adjusted
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.840]   to our situation and certain noises like a you know clock ticking or water dripping those
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.400]   are things that we just kind of we don't we just don't hear it anymore you know as I was
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.840]   sitting back last week and I was just kind of thinking like how much of our worship has
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.960]   if we're not careful can easily become like that you know those those of you who are new
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.880]   to the church you know everything's kind of new and different and so you're a lot more
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.660]   aware of little things but you know for people who've been here for a while five years ten
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.520]   years or longer everything has become such a routine I mean you're the same guy preaching
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.920]   in front of you for ten years how can it not become mind numbing you know I get tired of
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.520]   hearing myself you know but after a while you just kind of like clock in and clock out
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.000]   you know you ever sometimes you travel the same path maybe it's your work or school and
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.200]   you just drive and just mindlessly you don't even think about where to get off or right
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.760]   turn or left turn you just kind of zone out and then and then you kind of come back and
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.640]   you're at home that ever happened to you all the time right because we were just so accustomed
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.680]   to this path there's just not much thinking it's just automatic our faith and our walk
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.240]   with God can easily get to that point where we're not really thinking through what we're
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.040]   doing we're not really thinking through what we believe and why we believe you know especially
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.920]   when when something has been in routine for a long period of time and again I was sharing
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.020]   this with our leadership on Saturday morning thinking about that that we need to be careful
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.320]   that we don't get to that and again you know how this is related to what we're talking
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.720]   about Paul's been talking about the doctrine of justification by faith alone now he's been
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.720]   pounding this all the way through and he's going to be he's going to continue to pound
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.000]   this but justification by faith in other words salvation by faith alone if you've been a
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.040]   Christian for one year you probably heard it several dozen times if you've been a Christian
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.720]   for five years you probably heard it hundreds of times if you've been a Christian for more
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.880]   than 10 years I'm assuming you probably heard this thousands and thousands of times you've
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.800]   discussed it dissected it you've memorized scripture you've heard sermon after sermon
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.920]   after sermon Bible study after Bible study and then it just becomes numb like yes you
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.400]   know you only know when something is wrong it no longer affects your daily walk with
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.880]   God doesn't affect the way you worship God doesn't affect your fellowship you only notice
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.760]   it when something is wrong because you know it's so well that when somebody preaches something
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.920]   off it's like oh you have to have works like oh that's wrong so we know how to identify
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:01.480]   bad doctrine but it doesn't affect us in a positive way it doesn't affect us it doesn't
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:09.200]   move us and that may not be this core reason why we are gathered together justification
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:17.440]   by faith is at the core of Christianity if we are not affected by this doctrine you can't
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.640]   be worshiping God and I'm gonna be talking about that right if justification by faith
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.680]   is not the reason why we have fellowship your fellowship is no different than just human
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:35.160]   friendship if justification by faith is not the ultimate reason why we do evangelism it
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.320]   just becomes pressure it's extremely important we talk about here just in this short text
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.400]   from verses 9 through 12 he mentions the word circumcision probably eight nine separate
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.640]   times so obviously we know what the theme is here right he's trying to give us a proper
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:59.400]   perspective of what circumcision is and what it is not in order to really understand what
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.200]   Paul is saying here we have to understand what circumcision meant to the Jews today
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   you know when's the last time you actually had a discussion with somebody's like oh we
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.280]   don't need to be circumcised we're not Jews right that just does not come up in everyday
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.840]   life right you don't have discussions with you know warriors or Lakers and all of a sudden
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.240]   by the way I'm curious do we need to be circumcised today right I don't think that discussion
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.960]   forever naturally comes up it only comes up in the context of looking at the Bible and
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.680]   say well this is what Paul says so let's study it today right but I want to convey to you
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:41.560]   just how important what Paul is saying here to the Christian life again it's important
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.160]   for us to understand how important it was to the Jews so that we understand why so much
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:51.440]   time is dedicated in trying to properly understand this Genesis chapter 17 is where the commandment
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.960]   of circumcision is given and in within that commandment he says that every person outside
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.080]   of the Jewish community who wanted to worship God also needed to be circumcised so it wasn't
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.200]   just the children born into the nation it was anybody who wanted to be a worshipper
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:15.880]   of Yahweh had to be circumcised Genesis chapter 15 sorry Exodus chapter 12 48 it says that
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:22.040]   those who are not circumcised can't participate in their Passover meal so that's just kind
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.240]   of that's just equivalent to saying you know in our context that if you're not circumcised
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.080]   you can't come to our Christmas party you know it's the biggest event of the year you
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.600]   know very significant part of our culture but if you're not circumcised you can't come
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:41.320]   well this is written into the law in the Old Testament Genesis 17 14 in the giving of this
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:48.560]   commandment God wanted to convey just how important this was so he says the cutting
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:55.920]   off of the foreskin and he says if if an individual refuses to be circumcised let him also be
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.120]   cut off from the people because he has broken my commandment right so this was not just
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:08.000]   some tattoo this was not just some cutting of hair we're talking about a major surgery
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.360]   right was major then right and it says if they don't if they don't they refuse to get
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:20.140]   circumcised he's going to be shunned from the from the society so for a Jew for hundreds
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:26.800]   of years the identifying mark of a child of God in the Old Testament was circumcision
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:33.240]   so we can understand when Paul all of a sudden says no we don't need to be circumcised that
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.920]   we can't make people get circumcised in fact he was fighting this in the first hundred
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:43.240]   years that was one of the biggest issues in the early church before we jump on the Jews
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.680]   and say oh you know these guys are so blind and why would they make a big deal of this
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.120]   think about how often we have certain things that we become accustomed to and it becomes
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.600]   a problem when we see that we go to another church or somewhere else and they do a little
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.560]   bit differently you know I've had people who came from another other backgrounds hey how
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.960]   come you guys don't recite the Lord's Prayer you know and how come you don't recite the
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.680]   Apostles Creed why do you guys use drums you know what I mean electric guitar how come
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.880]   you guys don't have organs you know why do you wear a tie and then why don't you wear
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.200]   a tie you know and so you think about like if you've been raised in the church there
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.080]   are certain traditions that you've gotten accustomed to and when you go somewhere else
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.480]   and you don't see it it's just like you don't know why you don't know you don't know what
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.000]   it is that bothers you but it bothers you and something just doesn't seem right something
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.200]   as trivial as a necktie or not wearing a necktie is style of music you know or something as
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:46.240]   trivial as that we get bothered by it but imagine for a Jew where circumcision was the
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:52.800]   identifying mark of every Jew and all of a sudden Jesus Christ comes and these Apostles
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.720]   are preaching the gospel and he says no if you force people to get circumcised you are
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:04.480]   nullifying the cross right this is not a debatable issue if you make circumcision a part of our
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:10.400]   righteousness you nullify the cross there is no middle ground in fact Paul says if somebody
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:16.080]   preaches a gospel that perverts the gospel in any way let him be anathema there is no
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:22.120]   compromise with this you can't just hold on to some of it either you let it go you know
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.720]   and embrace Christ or you hold on to it and you reject Christ that's how important this
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:35.040]   issue was so Paul again beginning from chapter 4 1 has been addressing this issue but when
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:42.560]   we get to verse 9 he asks two rhetorical questions to kind of set up what he was trying to say
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:49.560]   the first one is is this blessing then only for the circumcised or also for the uncircumcised
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.760]   so the blessing he obviously here he's talking about justification by faith forgiveness of
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:12:01.840]   sins is this only for the Jews the answer is pretty clear no right the Abraham is a
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:09.320]   father of circumcised and uncircumcised because righteousness is by faith and not by circumcision
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.280]   the early church the very first problem that the early church had to deal with was this
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.960]   issue because Peter and Paul they go off and they start preaching the gospel and the Holy
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:25.320]   Spirit begins to fall upon the Gentiles and and Jews alike so when Paul and Peter comes
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:31.120]   back from their missionary journeys there's a group of Jews saying how could that be right
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.120]   for hundreds of years they had to be circumcised to be people of God and now you're saying
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:41.740]   the Holy Spirit is coming upon them indiscriminately that can't be and this issue was such a big
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.520]   issue was dividing the early church so they all convene in Jerusalem all the apostles
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:52.240]   get together in Genesis sorry in Acts chapter 15 they have a meeting and say you know what
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:58.200]   God's revelation is clear to all of us that the kingdom of God has opened to the Gentiles
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.120]   and the whole reason why Paul goes on his second missionary journey is to take that
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.440]   message and to begin to tell it to the Gentile churches that he went and planted churches
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:12.840]   that you do not need to be circumcised that was the first question that he dealt with
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.520]   the second question how then was it counted to him was it before or after he had been
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:25.120]   circumcised again Paul's trying to again continue in his argument and the answer is resounding
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:31.220]   before it was not after but before he was circumcised he said Abraham was considered
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:37.120]   righteous before he ever was circumcised now I'm gonna connect this to our you know our
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.400]   current situation so you know I don't want you sitting there thinking like okay circumcision
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.640]   you know like that that problem's been dealt with a hundred years ago why do why are we
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:51.000]   bringing this back up again again I'm gonna connect it I just want to be you to patient
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.840]   be patient with me a little bit Abraham was called initially called in met God in Genesis
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:04.280]   chapter 11 most commentators and scholars will say he was probably about 70 years old
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.520]   by the time God calls him out of war of Chaldeans in Genesis chapter 12 it's about five years
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:16.040]   have passed and then when we get to Genesis chapter 15 where God reiterates and and reconfirms
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.520]   the covenant that he's making with him and the nation of Israel he's probably about 80
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:26.200]   years old the commandment to be circumcised and to circumcise all the generations following
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:33.040]   him is given in Genesis chapter 17 so the time between Genesis chapter 11 to Genesis
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:40.160]   chapter 17 when he is actually circumcised is about 30 years so what Paul is saying is
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:45.720]   way before he asked God even gave the commandment of circumcision God called him a righteous
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.360]   man in Genesis chapter 15 he actually he he actually even says again this this passage
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:56.940]   is quoted several times in the New Testament and he says and he believed the Lord Abraham
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:03.840]   and he counted to him as righteousness he was counted righteous because of his faith
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:14.120]   not because of some external circumstance if that was the case why did he command the
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:20.400]   circumcision if circumcision has nothing to do with your righteousness then why command
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.360]   it why make this big deal and have people cut off and and if they don't obey that they
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:30.240]   can't participate in the Passover why was the big hoopla well he says and again Paul
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:37.160]   answers it and it says is answered in Genesis chapter 17 11 that the circumcision was the
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:44.920]   seal of righteousness it was the seal of righteousness Genesis 17 11 it says it was the seal of
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:50.840]   the covenant today when we think about sealing something we're talking about wrapping it
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:56.640]   up right like make sure that that Tupperware is properly sealed or you're moving or something
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.520]   something is sealed right we don't use the seal like the way they used it in the Old
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:06.200]   Testament or in the time of Christ the word seal that is used in that culture I'm just
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:13.720]   going to read directly from the Bible dictionary and says it is a signet a fencing in or in
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:20.800]   or protecting from misappropriation by implication it means the stamp that is impressed I mean
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.200]   you've probably seen movies or something where you burn the wax and there's a seal of the
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.520]   Emperor or seal of somebody important they put that stamp on it so that when they the
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.880]   recipient gets the letter they know that authenticity of where this came from so it was in that
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:44.680]   sense it was a seal is used as a mark of privacy but ultimately it was used to convey genuineness
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:49.560]   whether something was genuine or not so when the Bible says that circumcision was a seal
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:56.920]   it was a stamp of genuineness that that these people belong to God now let me illustrate
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.440]   how we ought to understand circumcision or how they ought to understand again how that
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:07.160]   applies to us you know years ago we would go back and forth to China and there was a
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:13.280]   sister in our church who worked in coach coach bags you know and I have you know when I go
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.720]   to China I can't distinguish between what is fake and what isn't what isn't fake everything
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:24.400]   looks authentic to me but I remember like she would be able to tell right off the bat
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.160]   she would walk through a shopping mall and say that's fake fake fake fake and then I
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.840]   know how do you know it looks the same to me so she would tell because she was trained
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.280]   while she was working here she was trained so she would tell me how the C's need to be
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.120]   aligned a certain way and and then she would show me look at this one this one's the going
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.320]   the other way you know she would look inside the bag and look at the seam and the tag so
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:48.520]   she had like 10 or 11 different things that you can identify as whether it's whether it's
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:54.240]   real or not right and then every once in a while you'll go through and you find a bag
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:00.880]   where the where all those identifying marks seem very very similar right she could tell
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.800]   right away I can't even after she pointed out to me it's like that looks authentic all
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.280]   the C's are headed toward the right direction everything she pointed out I mean they did
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.920]   a really good job they were committed to to this fakeness right so I can't tell but she
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.680]   calls and tells you she can tell little things you know here and there and and only she could
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:28.160]   tell right but let's say somebody did a fantastic job that even she can't tell I mean it was
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.840]   the knockoff was just done such a perfect job that even her even someone who's been
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.600]   property chain trained can't tell right so if they do a really good job imitating the
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:49.000]   original with all the marks does that make the bag real some of you guys like yes it
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:58.160]   does of course it doesn't make it real right it wasn't made by coach if it wasn't made
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:03.040]   by coach that doesn't matter how good of a job they did faking it it's not real right
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:10.160]   so in the same way that the circumcision in itself doesn't make it real right circumcision
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:18.720]   was only a seal to convey what was actually real and what was real was the faith it's
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:24.840]   a faith in that individual that makes the circumcision worth something without it it
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:34.200]   is worthless see circumcision was never meant to be a source of pride or righteousness when
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.080]   we talk about justification by faith sometimes we think like oh god introduced justification
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:46.720]   by faith in the New Testament but in actuality that was God's way of salvation always always
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.360]   and we see it all throughout scripture we see it with Abraham where God declared him
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:55.960]   righteous because of faith before he was circumcised in Jeremiah at 925 he says behold
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.440]   the days are coming declares the Lord when I will punish all those who are circumcised
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:05.960]   merely in the flesh again you're not going to be justified because you obey the law and
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.920]   you would jump through the hoop and got these signs he says if you are just circumcised
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:16.400]   in the flesh right there will be punishment Deuteronomy 36 and the Lord your God will
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.680]   circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring so that you will love the Lord your
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:26.480]   God with all your heart and with all your soul that you may live again Jesus reiterates
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.760]   that same commandment in the New Testament saying what is the greatest commandment is
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.800]   to love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength Paul says in Philippians
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:41.280]   chapter 3 - for the Pharisees who are circumcised in the flesh but not of the heart he says
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:49.680]   these people are just mutilators of the flesh ouch he said that's all it was all it is is
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:55.480]   mutilation that's all it does it counts for nothing in the eyes of God now how does this
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.360]   relate to infant baptism those are guys who were on Facebook and I put it like why we
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.480]   don't baptize infants well the whole sermon this morning is not about infant baptism right
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:11.640]   but it is relevant in this text because the primary text that the people baptize infants
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.240]   used to why we have to baptize infants which obviously you're at a Baptist church so we
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:23.380]   don't agree with that is Colossians chapter 2 11 through 12 so if you're interested go
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:28.920]   to that text right even if you're not please go to that text right Colossians chapter 2
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:37.760]   11 through 12 and I want to show you why this comes up and again I'm gonna wrap it
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:43.080]   all up and I'm gonna show I'm gonna try to convey why this is important Colossians chapter
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:50.300]   2 11 through 12 it says in him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:56.600]   hands by putting off of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ in other words
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.400]   that the circumcision that you guys are so proud of he says God the true circumcision
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:06.720]   is not a circumcision of the hand but a circumcision that Christ does and then he says having been
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:12.280]   buried with him in baptism in which you were also raised with him through faith in the
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:17.280]   powerful working of God who raised him from the dead so the key text that they point to
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:24.280]   is in verse 12 right is that here's the circumcision of the flesh but here's a real circumcision
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.520]   that Christ performs and then he talks about having been buried with him in baptism so
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:36.800]   the argument is that baptism has replaced the circumcision of the Old Testament right
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.680]   now the problem with that is that interpretation is the point that Paul is trying to make is
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:48.880]   that these Jews were holding on to a physical act of circumcision and saying in and of itself
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:56.640]   has no authority has no power it is not the real seal and so to move that and then to
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:03.760]   replace it with another seal with hands a physical baptism right so this physical circumcision
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.840]   doesn't make you a child of God so now we're going to give a physical circumcised physical
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:15.320]   application of baptism which is going to replace the physical act of circumcision you get it
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:21.480]   doesn't make any sense because Paul is arguing against that he's saying that your your physical
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:28.440]   act of circumcision does not make you a child of God so it doesn't make sense for him to
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.080]   say we're going to replace that now we're going to replace it with physical act of baptism
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:39.160]   right and all that has changed is the activity see the whole point of what he's trying to
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:44.760]   make is that you're stuck on thinking that some act of religiousness somehow gives you
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:52.760]   favor before God and Paul is saying no the real act of a child of God has nothing to
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:58.160]   do with something you do physically so going into the water and coming out sprinkling of
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:05.720]   some water on a child's head has no value in the eyes of God see and again what does
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.640]   it have to do with the text that we're looking at if you look at chapter 4 11 this is another
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:16.160]   text these are the two texts that is used by the infant Baptist to say why we baptize
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:22.560]   infants in verse 11 it says he received the sign of circumcision as the seal of righteousness
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:28.440]   right sign of circumcision in other words talking about Abraham and circumcision so
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:35.660]   the way that this is interpreted in verse 11 is that the seal of of the covenant relationship
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:42.120]   with God was circumcision so now we're in a New Testament the seal of the covenant relationship
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:48.040]   in the New Testament is baptism that's how that this is interpreted is that what Paul
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:57.440]   is saying here in no place in the scripture where it says that the seal that makes us
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:03.320]   a child of God or at least covers us with some special grace is baptism the physical
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:08.480]   act somehow places us in a community of covenant people and there's a special privilege that
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:14.880]   we have the problem with that interpretation is in the Old Testament circumcision was for
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:20.880]   the physical people of Israel physical people of Israel so God says to the nation of Israel
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.720]   if anybody touches you they're touching the apple of my eye he wasn't talking to a particular
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:31.120]   person he wasn't talking to a group of prophets he was talking to the physical kingdom of
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:37.560]   Israel because his plan was that by blessing them he was going to bless all the other nations
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:43.320]   and that through that physical nation that the seed of the woman was going to come through
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.880]   the tribe of Judah so his intention was to preserve this nation because of the coming
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:56.480]   of Christ so the seal of circumcision was for a physical group of people when we come
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:03.160]   to the New Testament is that is the physical gathering of the church is this the real church
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:11.560]   of God yes and no when Jesus said I will build my church and the gates of Hades will he will
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:20.200]   not prevail against it is he talking about is he talking about the church of Ephesus
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:27.680]   the church of Laodicea church of Berea church of Thessalonica is he talking about a physical
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:34.520]   church no he's not because none of those churches exist today when he said I will build my church
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.800]   and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it he was talking about the universal unseen
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.560]   church is he talking was that a promise is that you know what God said he was going to
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:51.640]   build Berean and Berean is going to last forever is that true no it's not because the promise
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:58.760]   he made about his church was about the unseen universal church does that mean the local
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:04.040]   church doesn't matter of course it matters because the local church is a physical manifestation
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.800]   of the church that he was talking about but not all in the church is a part of the real
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:14.920]   church so it is the spiritual church he's referring to so it doesn't make sense to take
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:21.760]   the physical act given to a physical kingdom and then to apply it to the physical church
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:29.800]   when the true church is a spiritual church now why is this important why do we need to
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:35.000]   say this other than to say we're right right other than to say you know this I believe
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.240]   that this is the right doctrine see that when we come to the New Testament the seal is not
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:53.680]   baptism what is the seal of the New Testament believer you can't fail maybe you can't fail
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:59.200]   what is the what does the Bible say is the seal of a New Testament believer the Holy
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:06.800]   Spirit the Holy Spirit not some physical act right not sprinkling of water not baptism
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:11.800]   he says the Holy Spirit Ephesians 1 13 in him you also when you heard the word of truth
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.280]   the gospel of your salvation and believed in him were sealed with the promised Holy
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:21.840]   Spirit so if there is any replacement of the seal of the Old Testament circumcision it
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:29.080]   is the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's the seal not another physical act Ephesians 4
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:36.080]   30 and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you are sealed for the day of redemption
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:42.040]   again the seal in the New Testament that identifies a child of God with people who are not maybe
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:47.200]   not a child is the Holy Spirit that's why Paul says in Galatians 3 3 are you so foolish
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:53.280]   having begun by the Spirit are you now being perfected by the flesh now we're going to
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:29:00.120]   get to practical application like what does this mean when we make a physical act the
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:06.400]   identifying mark of what it means to you a Christian we're kind of hanging our hats on
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.360]   some activity and say you know what I go to church and I read my Bible and I've given
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:15.240]   to the church and I went to small group and I did all of these things and so that identifies
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:23.880]   me as a Christian you can do all of that and still not be a Christian remember 1st Corinthians
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.920]   chapter 13 it talks about like you can speak of tongue of an angel angels and have not
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:35.600]   love it's nothing you can speak prophecies you can have faith that moves mountains you
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.720]   can actually give your life to be martyred and still have not loved it means absolutely
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:48.080]   nothing in other words if if your what identifies you what mark the seal that identifies you
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:54.320]   is just these physical acts even if you're martyred right even when you are martyred
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:30:05.000]   he says it could mean nothing why is this so important to us is important to us because
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.240]   what identifies us as a Christian is what causes us to grow and to mature and it is
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:16.920]   a foundation for everything that we do so you and I have a tendency that when we ask
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.480]   somebody how are you doing spiritually I did my quiet time I didn't do my quiet time I
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:26.520]   haven't been to church for a while you know I haven't been participating in small group
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:31.520]   you know I or I went to missions or I've been giving and I've been serving and we have these
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:37.440]   physical identifiers and we hang our hats on that and say well I'm doing these things
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:43.520]   so therefore I'm a child of God the problem with that is Jesus comes and says not everybody
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.640]   who calls me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven that didn't we cast out demons in
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:55.120]   your name didn't we perform miracles and heal the sick in your name right he says none of
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.400]   these things you would did for me I never knew you so he looks at all these external
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:05.440]   activities but he breaks through all of that and he's looking for faith he's looking for
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:11.560]   genuine faith that is causing people to do all of these things see he says oh why why
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.920]   was the circumcision was so necessary what was important about this and why is this doctrine
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:20.280]   of justification by faith so important well he says later on verse 11 the purpose was
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.880]   to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised right circumcision
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:30.040]   was temporary for the kingdom of Israel so that it would prepare the coming of the seed
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:36.960]   of the woman but really that Abraham was not simply a father of Israel but father of all
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:42.640]   faith so that the righteousness will be counted to them as well verse 12 and to make him the
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:47.880]   father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:53.000]   of the faith right now we're talking about all these acts and what we do in obedience
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.960]   does it matter yes it matters right but it's why we do these things that make the act worship
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:17.240]   or drudgery prayer without faith is just meditation worship without faith it's just duty fellowship
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:24.640]   without faith it's just friendship like any other place everything that we do if it is
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.880]   not done in faith we can do it well we can be disciplined and will ourselves and organize
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:34.040]   and and be smart enough to get all of these things done but if it is not done in faith
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:39.320]   if it is not because we've been moved by Christ it's not because we are attracted to him reading
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:47.360]   the Bible just become study it's just study a document that was written 2,000 years ago
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:52.200]   and we're just studying it like we would study you know biology or chemistry whatever we
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.360]   just study and then at the end of it you're no longer closer to God than you did when
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:04.200]   you first began you just have more knowledge that's it anything done and it is not founded
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:13.520]   upon faith will lead to more enslavement it will lead to more enslavement more things
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:20.040]   to to do that's why it says in Galatians 5 16 but I say walk by the Spirit and you will
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:26.320]   not gratify the desires of the flesh it is the Holy Spirit that is a seal in you Galatians
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:35.720]   5 22 23 but the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:42.520]   gentleness self-control against such things there is no law there is no standard that
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:47.760]   is created that if you meet these standards then you have assurance and if you don't meet
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:54.920]   these standards right you have no assurance that's not what he says you know what's interesting
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.560]   is Paul writes two letters to the Corinthians and it's probably the harshest letters that
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:05.800]   he writes in all the New Testament I mean these people were fighting each other they
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:12.080]   allowed immorality in the church but it was all in the context of doing God's work it
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.160]   was all in the context of preaching the gospel established the early church they were being
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:20.000]   persecuted while they're doing this and yet he says all of that means nothing and at the
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   end of the two letters that he writes he concludes by this warning 2nd Corinthians 13 5 examine
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   yourself to see whether you are in the faith test yourself or do you not realize this about
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.880]   yourself that Jesus Christ is in you unless indeed you fall to you fail to meet the test
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:47.000]   so in other words what Paul is saying is or everything I've said in conclusion the reason
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.520]   why that you may have been going astray is for two reasons one either you don't have
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:57.920]   the faith and that's why the church is being becoming corrupt and you're allowing all kinds
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:05.360]   of sin into the church or you have forgotten what you have in Christ you have forgotten
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.440]   justification by faith that you somehow you think by by doing and meeting these standards
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:19.920]   and you're gonna one up each other if the greatest sin of mankind is self-exaltation
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:26.960]   which it is then the greatest gift that God gives us is to humble us and that's exactly
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.680]   what it says in Ephesians 2 8 and 9 for by grace you have been saved not of yourselves
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:40.480]   but as a gift of God that no one may boast nobody at the core of human sin is self-exaltation
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.520]   now don't you don't have to answer because I already know the answer because I know it
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:54.640]   even in myself that everything that we pursue is about exalting ourselves we work harder
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.760]   because we want to get more money so we can have an easier life we want to be recognized
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:03.640]   we want to be better we get better education so that we can be better have a nicer place
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:09.840]   better house more opportunities to be honored and even in the church even in the church
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:15.840]   we work hard and we want to be recognized even as we plant churches we want to have
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:22.680]   a big church even as we evangelize how many converts do you have how many mission fields
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:27.960]   how many missionaries did you send out even in the context of honoring and glorifying
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:35.520]   God that the core of it if we're not careful that we end up with the same sin that brought
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:45.760]   condemnation to the world the self-exaltation you see somebody who is motivated by external
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:53.760]   you know external markers will always try to meet that marker and that's it did you
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:59.680]   do quiet time I did it did you pray I'm praying about 10 minutes a day or 15 minutes 30 minutes
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:06.400]   I did it I've done it right and if you meet it you become proud if you meet it because
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.760]   you did it and then and then you're very impatient with people who don't meet this marker right
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:16.280]   and then those who don't meet it live with guilt oh I didn't meet it I should meet it
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:21.160]   the difference between somebody like the Jews who were circumcised and say well we're circumcised
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:25.080]   we're from the tribe of Benjamin and you know and they're proud of all of these things we
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.920]   have this but Jesus says you're doing all of this but it has nothing to do with me even
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.320]   when you pray you pray so that everybody else can see is that wow that guy's a man of prayer
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.920]   even when you give you give publicly so that look what I've done is that all of that is
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:46.360]   not worship it's your self-exaltation you're just doing it in the name of God see but people
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:55.000]   who pursue him in faith is not about meeting standards right we we end up pursuing God
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   the same way but even with more fervor because it is not about appeasing God it's not about
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.320]   meeting expectations of people people who worship in faith worship because that's my
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:15.600]   source of life I feel alive when I am with God I trust in his promises more than any
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:22.280]   promise that my boss has given me I I am looking more forward to eternity than I am for my
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:30.600]   retirement and so an individual who is working in faith will always give above and beyond
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:35.920]   a person who is trying to appease the standard will just give what the absolute minimum that
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:43.000]   he needs to give so I've done my part right if you look at the Old Testament there is
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.440]   a mandatory sacrifice and there's a free will sacrifice mandatory sacrifice the whole offering
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:54.640]   the guilt offering the sin offering all of these things were fulfilled in Christ there
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:00.080]   is no barrier there is no more sacrifice that is needed for me to be able to call him my
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.200]   Abba Father but the new it also has a free will offering where God says when you are
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:09.200]   moved when you want to give a Thanksgiving offering you give sacrifices to God as simply
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:15.040]   as an act of worship it is not commanded but it was out of the abundance of your heart
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:21.320]   we come to the New Testament the mandatory sacrifice has been made in Christ so therefore
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:27.120]   he says whether you eat or drink do it for the glory of God meaning what he wants from
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:34.640]   us is not to not to appease or reach some standard but worship that whether whatever
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:38.640]   we are doing whether we come into church whether we're giving whether we're sacrificing whatever
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:47.760]   we're doing it is an act of worship it is a reasonable response to justification by faith
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:56.320]   see the moment that we forget that what it is that we have in Christ we become we become
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:03.200]   proud some people are better at hiding the pride than others those of you who are outgoing
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:08.800]   you talk a lot like I do it's pretty easy to see the pride even as I preach here I'm
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.920]   sure you you've noticed me boasting about something like that guy he's always talking
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.880]   about what he's been you know I'm pretty sure that's one of the downfalls of being up here
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:22.560]   all the time right for after so many years you know everything that guy is so proud of
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.920]   this important like it you know some of you guys are better at hiding because you're introverted
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:34.880]   so you don't say a lot you don't say a lot so you just seem to be humble right then you
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:38.440]   get in the car and have a long drive and then you start hearing things like dang you know
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:43.880]   like some people are better some people are better than others at hiding it some people
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:49.800]   are you know boastful right but we all wrestle with it right to different degrees we all
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.680]   wrestle with it right you ever you know the Bible says that God opposes the proud and
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:58.800]   gives grace to the humble and you notice how that's all inside of us too right whenever
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:05.760]   somebody is always boasting our natural instinct is we want to see him humbled admit it right
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.040]   that's that's in our hearts right and then we see somebody really humble and then we're
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:15.880]   like did you that guy's so humble like we're we're like we're eager to to lift them up
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.960]   and put them on a pedestal because they're so humble right it was meet one of those people
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.960]   like no matter what story you have their story is better you know I mean no matter what your
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:28.200]   kid did their kid did even better you know what I mean it's like oh they're talking and
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:34.560]   you know three words are putting put together my kid can do four you know at the core of
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:40.800]   who we are see there's four things that it when when we forget and we drift away from
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:47.240]   justification by faith and we have some external sign whether it's circumcision whether it's
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:54.000]   anything that we do physically right we're praying more we're doing this and and it kind
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.200]   of hardens our heart it ruins everything there's four things that I want to mention and let
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:05.960]   me wrap up this morning when we forget justification by faith and we are not humble boasting makes
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:14.880]   us the object of worship rather than God even as we are serving God boasting makes us the
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.200]   object of worship rather than God instead of pointing finger and say well how great
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:24.480]   he is we we talk about like what I've done my experience my knowledge you know like what
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:29.120]   I've accomplished what I'm able to do the insights that I have and we take away from
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:36.120]   his glory when the scripture says that his whole point in history is to is for him to
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:43.280]   be magnified because when he is magnified and we see his glory we live but anytime boasting
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:51.920]   comes in we try to take that glory one number two boasting causes us to minimize his glory
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:59.880]   and jeopardizing our life if salvation is the blinders that cause us not to see the
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.960]   glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ and by the grace of God he takes that away and we've
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:14.080]   seen his glory and we were changed boasting minimizes his glory so when his glory is minimized
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:20.480]   what happens to our joy it gets frustrated right because art the scripture says that
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:27.120]   in him is life Zoe he came to give life he came to give life not this world not your
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:34.600]   experience not your knowledge he so when his glory is minimized so is your joy so when
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:43.200]   there's boasting we take away from his glory and we take joy away from ourselves third
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:50.400]   boasting ruins fellowship people who are affected by justification by faith tend to be more
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:56.920]   gracious the text that we read in in Psalm 51 he says what God desires to worship is
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:03.600]   a broken and contrite heart a person who is justified by faith and has been affected by
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:10.360]   that every day his response is thank God he saved me see if somebody who's not affected
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.880]   by I mean you may know it you may recite it with your mouth but you're not affected by
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:21.080]   it we're always looking to see why aren't they doing what I'm doing see a group of people
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:26.640]   who are affected by justification by faith are people you'd love to be around because
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:33.600]   they're broken you can be open with him you can you can share your struggles with them
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:42.480]   because we're sinners on the same path and just as much as I need grace you need grace
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:48.200]   it ruins fellowship when you have a room full of people who are religious who've done the
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.680]   right thing you have people who've done who were doing the right things who were looking
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.040]   down at people who are not doing the right things and you have the people who are not
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.320]   doing the right things just guilty and you know burden because they're not meeting these
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:05.600]   standards but people who are affected by our salvation what Christ has done it affects
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:12.280]   our fellowship and finally number four boasting prevents others to come to Christ boasting
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:19.080]   presents prevents others from coming to Christ Paul says the first Timothy 1 15 16 this saying
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:24.000]   is trustworthy and deserving of all full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.760]   sinners of whom I am the foremost right so not only did he come to save sinners he came
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:35.680]   and saved the worst and he really was the worst right if you come to the New Testament
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:40.160]   I mean he's the guy responsible for the first martyr in the New Testament he is responsible
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.640]   for the first great persecution where hundreds even thousands of people had to leave Jerusalem
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:50.400]   because of this guy he gathered a group of people he's willing to kill slaughter drag
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:55.640]   them into prison I mean he devoted himself to persecute and so he says not only did he
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:00.520]   come to save sinners he chose me the worst but I received mercy for this reason that
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:06.800]   in me as the foremost Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:13.320]   who were to believe in him for eternal life God chose a man who didn't deserve I mean
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.120]   of course none of us deserves it but that guy you know there's some people that we can
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:22.480]   think of like you know I'm a sinner but that guy is a real sinner you know I mean I'm a
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.040]   sinner I admit I'm a sinner but that guy's a much worse sinner than I am it would have
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:30.680]   been this guy right there a group of people chose like yeah we're all sinners but there's
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:36.320]   the different degrees of sin Paul would have been the foremost is that God didn't choose
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:40.560]   him because of his farisite background but because he was well connected or you know
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:45.600]   oftentimes all he had Roman citizen of course all of that helped him out right God made
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:52.560]   him make tents this guy had access to money and he had to make tents this guy's going
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.960]   out preaching the gospel and God puts a thorn in the side for what reason just to keep him
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:05.800]   humble just to remind him who he is just so that he can say in my weakness he is strong
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:11.660]   it doesn't make sense for ambassadors of Christ where he came and humbled himself the image
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:17.040]   that we have of Christ the last image that Jesus left with us is with his disciples washing
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:23.600]   his feet the most menial most humbling of task that's the last image he gave to his
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:28.520]   disciples and then the very last is him hanging on the cross humiliated in front of the world
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:36.400]   and it doesn't make sense for the people of God preaching this gospel to be doing it in
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:44.160]   pride how do we how are we ambassadors of Christ if we invite people sit and then and
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:49.800]   then we we step aside we introduce Jesus that he doesn't look anything like the church he
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:55.760]   doesn't look anything like the fellowship of the church see pride prevents the preaching
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:05.400]   of the gospel the justification by faith it affects everything that we do if we are no
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:13.480]   longer affected by it there's a reason why you can't pray if we're not affected by justification
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:20.820]   by faith you're just you just become numb maybe even what I'm saying this morning is
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:26.640]   just like how many times I heard this right and just like you don't like you're sitting
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.260]   there you don't hear your heart right it's beating there's noise there you ever notice
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:36.320]   that you get a stethoscope or you put it in your heart and boom boom boom boom it's pretty
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:41.480]   loud right but as soon as you take that away you don't hear a thing when's the last time
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:47.880]   you actually heard your heart beating but it's there the sound is there but we become
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:54.280]   the our brains have adjusted to it we no longer hear it the most important thing that you
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:49:02.140]   and I need to hear and to be affected by every single day is what he has done you and I did
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:12.240]   not deserve this Christ came and pursued sinners I know you know like how hard it is to love
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:18.880]   sinners right and it's not just me you know it as much as I do loving sinners is a lot
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:25.480]   of work right you know get you on your knees crying out to God right reading the Bible
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:32.200]   you just read it like praying going along and I just do it love sinners see see how
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:38.760]   hard that is right just and in fact the longer I live you would think you would get easier
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:44.400]   doesn't get easier it gets much harder so something to look forward to right it gets
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:49.160]   much harder because you have more and more memories of being disappointed with people
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:54.200]   you know like I can't trust people you know you give all yourself and then you know it
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:50:00.800]   doesn't take much I mean human relationships are so fragile you know there is no you know
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.760]   I was just thinking about that you know that saying there's no honor among thieves because
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.800]   they're already like breaking the law and doing all this stuff there's no honor so their
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.800]   promise means nothing because they're they're a group of people who are already breaking
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:18.720]   the law so what honor is there and I was just thinking isn't that us there's no honor there's
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:26.200]   no loyalty among sinners right there's no loyalty there's no honor among sinners we're
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:32.280]   we're you know we're selfishness and and anger and bitterness and self-protection self-exaltation
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:39.480]   is at the core of our hearts there's no innate honor in that and yet Christ chose to love
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:48.800]   us in that while we were yet sinners he pursued us and so if we're not motivated by the justification
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:56.880]   by faith for what he's done for me where do you get the help to love others what's going
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:02.760]   to motivate you to love a sinner what's going to cause you to persevere with other sinners
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:12.480]   it is not in you it's not in me only people who have been affected by the cross can love
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:20.040]   as he loved so why this justification by faith is at the core of what you and I do every
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:27.160]   single week so if we become numb to this it just has become noise nothing else you do
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:32.320]   in life is going to matter it's an emergency just like Paul says take a step back examine
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:37.920]   yourself examine if it is faith that is causing you to do what you're doing or is it circumcision
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:47.880]   [ Silence ]
