[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   A podcast listener from Malaysia named Sun Yin writes in to ask this.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.000]   "Hello Pastor John. My home church hardly preaches about the cross in sermons,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   usually only during Easter or Christmas. I have approached my pastors and asked
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   about this with gentleness, tact, and respect. They point out Hebrews 6:1-2
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   stating that we need to move beyond the cross to other more mature teachings in
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   the Bible. Is that the right view of the gospel?" Thank you Pastor John.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   When I was growing up, the church I was in preached and taught in a way that may
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   perhaps be the kind of ministry this church in Malaysia is reacting against.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   They are saying, this church in Malaysia are saying, that we need to move beyond
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   the cross to more mature teachings in the Bible. And in a sense, that's what I
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   would have said about my church that I grew up in. Now it's not a helpful way to say it.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Well, I'll come back to that, but I'm just trying to figure out what's in the minds
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   of this church when they talk like this to Sun Yin. It would have been misleading
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   for me to talk like that, but something needed to change. I knew something was amiss.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   We did need to move on. We did somehow need to go beyond what was being said
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Sunday after Sunday, because almost every Sunday it seemed that we circled around
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   to the most simple, basic, repetitive gospel invitation to unbelievers to be saved.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And everybody started putting on their coats, and everybody knew it was coming,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and we hardly ever got "beyond it." It never felt as though the depth and breadth
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   and height of the biblical books were even being looked at, let alone penetrated.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And so I can imagine that a church, this church in Malaysia perhaps, would react
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   against that by saying, "We need to get beyond the cross." And what they might
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   mean, maybe, is we need to stop being so superficial and repetitive and narrow
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   in presenting the gospel to unbelievers at the expense of feeding believers
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   on the riches of biblical truth. But the way to describe what's needed here
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   is not to say that we move on from the cross. What's needed is to take all
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Scripture into account and teach it in fullness and depth, all that it really is,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   and show our people how the cross of Jesus is profoundly the ground and the goal
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   of all those teachings. In other words, we don't need to leave the cross behind;
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   we need to show how Scriptures are leading to the cross and how all the blessings
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   of the New Testament and the blessings of life in Christ and the blessings of the
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   age to come, all of them flow from the cross. And we show why we will forever
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   be celebrating the grace of God, which is most supremely revealed in the cross.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   We are always going to be singing the song of the Lamb, the slain Lamb,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   forever and ever. But we do need to answer the question from the church
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   pastors about Hebrews 6, because it looks like they've got something going
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   for their words there, right? Here's what it says, "Therefore let us leave
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God and of
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   the eternal judgment. And this we will do if God permits." Now, what does he mean
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   by leaving behind the elementary doctrine of Christ? And there are a couple of
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   clues here that anybody can see if they just look close enough. Do a look at the
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   book here. The first clue is the statement, "Not laying again a foundation."
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   In other words, what this author is opposed to is continually building
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   foundations when we ought to be building on foundations. He's saying, "One day
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   you lay a foundation, you dig it up and lay it the next day, and you dig it up
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   and you lay it the next day." That's not what foundations are for.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Foundations are for building. So put the foundation in the place and then let it
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   stretch up into a beautiful building where the people can roam around in the
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   house of God's Word and see all the glories being upheld by the foundation.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   So I think that's the first clue that he doesn't mean that you forget, for goodness
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   sakes, that Christ died, but that you don't keep treating it merely in a
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   foundational way as though there's nothing else to talk about on top of it,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   leading out of it. And here's another clue. It says that he will not lay again
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   a foundation of faith toward God. My goodness. So I want to know, does the
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   church in Malaysia leave behind faith toward God? I mean, good grief.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Faith toward God is the sum of the Christian life, beginning, middle,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   and we're going to be trusting God every moment of our lives. There's no leaving
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   behind. So again, I think that points to the fact that the author of Hebrews
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   didn't mean leave behind in the sense of don't talk about anymore, but rather
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   stop digging things up and laying foundations over and over again, treating
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   them in a superficial, repetitive, elementary way, but rather get on with
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   what foundations are for. Build on them. And even the word "foundation" as a
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   metaphor becomes inadequate. I think the Bible knows that, which is probably why
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   the Bible sometimes juxtaposes both organic analogies like roots and growth
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   and foundations and building, because foundations really are separate from
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   buildings, but roots and branches aren't separate. They're all one growing piece.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And so the implication is that when you properly lay a foundation, it's like a
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   root. It grows up into something big and glorious and beautiful. So when Sun Yen's
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   pastors say, "We need to move on from the cross to other more mature teachings in
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   the Bible," perhaps what Sun Yen should suggest is that they consider the
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   implications of Romans 8:32, which says, "He who did not spare his own son but
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   gave him up for us all," that's the cross, "how will he not also with him
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   graciously give us all things?" And the point of that verse is that all things,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   everything we have in the Christian life, everything that's promised to us in the
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   future, is rooted in, based on, growing out of, "God did not spare his own son," and
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   therefore can never be left behind, because it is always the ever-present
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   purchase price and sustaining power of every blessing that we have. So the cross
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   was the goal of redemptive history, because the cross is the place where the
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   glory of the grace of God was most supremely expressed, and we will be
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   praising the glory of God's grace supremely expressed in the cross forever
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   and ever, and therefore in one sense the cross is both the ground basis and the
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   goal of all things. But it is absolutely crucial that the "all things" be preached.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   It's not simplistic, it's not limiting, it's not narrow to say that we should be
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   focused on the cross. I pray that Sunyun's church will discover that all the
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   riches of Scripture are not diminished by focusing on the cross. There's a way
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   to be cross-centered, cross-rooted, cross-exalting, without being cross-
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   exclusive. Boom. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question. Sunyun,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   one of our podcast listeners in Malaysia, if you have a question for John Piper, or
