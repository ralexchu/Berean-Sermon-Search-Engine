[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   >> All right, I have the pleasure of introducing our guest speaker today.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   This is Pastor John Kim.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Yes, you can be seated, sorry.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   He's from Lighthouse Bible Church in LA.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   He graduated from UCLA and then Master's Seminary.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   He went on to plant Lighthouse Bible Church San Diego in 1998,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   eventually planting also in San Jose and later in LA.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   He has been shepherding the congregation and also developing and
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   training pastors for church ministry.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Pastor John has been married to his wife, Angela, for 35 years.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   And he's a father to four daughters, Jenna, Kara, Alyssa, and Olivia.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   So why don't we give him a warm welcome as he comes on stage.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Thank you.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   >> Thank you, Nathan.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Well, it's good to be here with all of you here at Berean.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   I think I spoke at a retreat like in the early 2000s.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   So some of you might not have been quite yet born or alive yet long.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   But it is good to be here.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   I bring greetings from Lighthouse Bible Church LA.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   As Nathan mentioned, I've been serving there now for about ten years,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   been in church planting.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And I think that's one thing I learned about church planting.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   It's hard.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   And Pastor Peter, he told me when we were gonna go plant in San Jose,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   he's like, are you crazy?
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   What are you doing?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   But somehow God has truly been gracious and
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   provided many, many opportunities for his work to be done.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   I have a slide of my family.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Not only do I have four daughters.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Yes, I just celebrated my 35th anniversary with my wife, Angela.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   We have a son-in-law, our second daughter,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   married a guy from the Czech Republic, Vasek.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   And they have two little boys.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   So we are grandparents.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   And it's still kind of weird.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   When I hear grandparent, I think really old.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And then I guess I'm old.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   So they're not able to be here with me today.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Actually, Benny, my oldest grandson, last night he got sick.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   You could be praying for him.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Pastor Peter has really been a wonderful friend for many years.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Great encouragement.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   We actually were in Korea a few weeks ago during the same time.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   I think you guys had a team out there.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   We were trying to connect and get together.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   But it was a little too hectic.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   So we're actually having lunch this Thursday.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   So I'm looking forward to that.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   I also know Pastor Nathaniel and Keziah.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   They were in college when I was pastoring in San Diego.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   And so I got to see them when they were very young.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   And we actually just had dinner with them a couple weeks ago.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And seeing them now married with their children,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   seeing the faithful ministry that they're doing here has been a great encouragement.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   I also know Pastor Mark and Bia.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   They have family members at Lighthouse San Diego.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   So I got to know them during their many visits.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I don't know if she's here at this service, but I have a niece here, Annabelle.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   And so I'm excited to see her at this service or next service.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And I know a number of you as well.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Or I think I know your parents.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   That's kind of strange now.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   But how it works now, I know many of them are at the retreat.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   So it's really a privilege to be here.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   And I do want to give a shout-out to Chester and Nathan.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   I don't know if they're here.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Oh, right there? Okay.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Yeah, I saw them last Sunday.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   They were visiting Lighthouse LA.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And so good to see you two weeks in a row.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Well, something I like to do to remember churches that I have preached at
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   is I'd like to take a picture of you.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   So if you could just stay still, I'm going to take a panorama shot.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Okay, here we go.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Smile. Don't move.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   All right. Thank you.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   I'm going to be reading from Genesis chapter 50 from verses 15 to 21 to start off our time.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   The title is "God-Mented for Good."
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   We're going to be looking at the story of Joseph.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Genesis 50, starting from verse 15.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   "Then Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And they said, 'What if Joseph bears a grudge against us
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   and returns back to us all the evil which we dealt against him?'
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, 'Your father commanded before he died,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   saying, "Thus you shall say to Joseph, 'Please forgive.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   I beg you the transgression of your brothers and their sin,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   for they dealt evil against you.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   So now please forgive the transgression of the slaves of the God of your father.'
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Then his brothers also came and fell down before him and said,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   'Behold, we are your slaves.'
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   But Joseph said to them, 'Do not be afraid, for am I in God's place?
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   in order to do what has happened on this day, to keep many people alive.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   So now do not be afraid.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   I will provide for you and your little ones.'
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And he comforted them and spoke to their heart."
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Let's pray.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Heavenly Father, we ask you now as we come to your word,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   may you cleanse our hearts from sin,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   may you fill us with your Holy Spirit,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   and may you bring conviction to our hearts and minds
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   to learn what your truth has for us this morning.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   May we consider how great you are
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   and how gracious you are that you might give us this time together.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   So may you help each person here in this room to receive your truth
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   so that each of us might be changed to become more like Christ,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   to your glory, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   I would like to ask you a maybe somewhat controversial question
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   that might challenge you.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Are you a closet prosperity gospel supporter?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Now I think you guys are a pretty solid church.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   You have very wonderful pastors who are committed to teaching you God's word,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   and I would assume you know your stuff.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   But I ask this because even with all those things,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   and as a pastor, one thing I always wonder is,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   so how do people actually live?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   How do you take God's truth and how do you actually apply it?
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   You might affirm it.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   You might agree with it.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   You might say, "Yes, I go to Berean.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   I believe in God, the authority of God's word.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   I believe in the gospel."
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   But then when you look at your everyday life,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   do you fit the profile of what some call the typical SoCal Christian?
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Now what's the SoCal Christian?
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   The SoCal Christian is--and I'm one of them.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   I'm here. I'm in SoCal too.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   We're kind of used to the nice life.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   We're used to nice weather.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   We're used to having plenty of things to do.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   There's always good food to eat.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   There are people to meet.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   I mean I don't think there's really maybe any better place in the world
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   to really live and enjoy the good things of life,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   at least as the world considers it, compared to SoCal.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   But when it comes to Christianity,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   there's a perception that SoCal Christians are kind of soft.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Why? Because we like the comfortable life.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   We like the convenient life.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   We like a life with no problems.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   We like a life with a lot of conveniences.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Could it be that there is a not-so-subtle rejection
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   of the call to suffer for the sake of Christ?
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Or maybe at least we think that the good life that we think God will give us
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   is a life that is actually prosperous.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   I mean think about the things that many people pray for.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   God, help me get into a good school.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   God, help me to get a good job.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   God, help me to find a spouse.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   God, help me this. God, help me that.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   But for what end?
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Do we realize that God has actually called us to a life of suffering?
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Philippians 1:29-30 says,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   "For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   having the same struggle which you saw in me and now hear to be in me."
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   The Apostle Paul makes it very clear that to believe in Jesus,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   you are not only granted the gift of salvation,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   but you are granted the privilege to suffer for the sake of Jesus.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Now, how many of us think that that's a privilege?
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   We like to read stories of other people suffering.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Ooh, that's tough.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   But God, thank you, I'm not the example.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   I'd rather have other people be that example.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Jesus states it clearly himself in the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Matthew 5.10, he says, "Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   So there's something very distinctive.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   A confessing Christian should be able to show in his life
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   that you know that there will be suffering, persecution, hardships,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   and you also have been shown how to respond.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Later on in Matthew 5, verse 43, Jesus says, "But I say to you,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   For he causes his son to rise on the evil and the good
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others?
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Do not even the Gentiles do the same?"
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   In other words, Jesus is saying your life's supposed to be different.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   There should be something that really stands out, especially in light of suffering.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Life brings many tests and challenges.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   There are challenges that come with prosperity.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   There are challenges that come with suffering.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Now, I don't think we mind necessarily the prosperity part.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   I mean, at the least we get something out of it.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   I mean, I just went to Korea, like I said, a few weeks ago,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   and the thing I was really starting to think about during that trip
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   was the Korean food is great. I love Korean food.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   But I was dying for a burger, a very specific burger, In-N-Out burger.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I was also dying for a burrito.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   And my daughters very kindly, when my wife and I returned, they got both.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   And so I was so thankful.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Thank you, God, for letting us live in Southern California
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   where we have wonderful Mexican food and wonderful In-N-Out.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   When there are the tests of suffering, though,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   I think there's something about suffering that reveals the true character of people.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   You might have gone through some hardships, maybe growing up.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Maybe you are even going through some hardships even now.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   And it's always interesting to watch how people respond to hard times.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   I think if you're like most people, including myself,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   it's very easy to complain, to grumble, to maybe even start blaming God.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   "God, why? Why? Why are you letting me go through these things?"
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Then there are sinful responses, getting angry, showing hatred toward people,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   refusing to forgive, and justifying it all by saying,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   "Well, you know, it's just hard. You don't understand what I'm going through."
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   When you read a story like Joseph in the Bible,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   we might think that while there's obviously the possibility of suffering in life,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   injustice, hatred, envy, all the ways in which others can hurt you,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   people can definitely make your life miserable.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   But in the end, do we have an expectation that God's going to just make all the problems get resolved?
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   That it's all going to turn good?
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   I mean, we love those kind of stories, don't we?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   We like the rags to riches story.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Someone who starts off poor, ends up a king.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   You know, I watched a lot of princess movies with my daughters growing up.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   In fact, every one.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   I watched the entire Barbie series.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   You know, I grew up with just brothers. It was a whole different world.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   But watching all the Disney movies and so forth, there's a common theme in many of them, right?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   There's someone who's in hardship, but then they attain to prosperity at the end.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   And maybe, and that's what I'm talking about, maybe we're closet prosperity gospel people,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   because deep down inside, we kind of just want the story to end well.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Okay, maybe there's some suffering, maybe there's some hardship, but it's all going to end up well, right?
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   And it's not that God cannot provide blessings in that way.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   But are you going to really get the happily ever after?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   How about the Apostle Paul? Did he get a happily ever after?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   He ended up in jail and martyred.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   I mean, I thought if anyone needed a sabbatical, it was Apostle Paul.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   If anyone deserved to go to a retirement home and end up getting some rest, the Apostle Paul.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   But no, to the end, he is suffering.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Now, I really like the story of Joseph.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   It's one of my favorites because his life is an example of how one responds to suffering,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   how one trusts in the providence of God amidst hardship after hardship.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Now, this is going to be a little hard to do.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   I'm going to try to do a quick overview of his life, and quick is hard.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   But I was getting really hung up all week on this, getting stuck.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   My notes got longer and longer and longer, so I will try to go through this quick.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   But I have some slides.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   So the slide after, yeah, first one.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   You all start there.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Starting in Genesis 37, we see that Jacob has 12 sons that are mentioned.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Four wives, Leah, Rachel, Bilhah, and Zilpah.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Leah has the following, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, and a daughter, Dinah.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Rachel has Joseph and Benjamin.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Bilhah is Rachel's maidservant, has Dan and Naphtali.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   And Zilpah, who is Leah's maidservant, has Gad and Asher.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Four wives, 12 sons, one daughter.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   I've been watching a lot of Korean dramas lately.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   And, you know, for those of you who watch Korean dramas,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   there's a reason why Koreans are very dramatic, you know.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Very, very, you know, there's a lot of emotion going on, because there's always drama.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   There's always crazy drama.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   For me, like, this story is like Korean drama on steroids.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Four wives.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   I mean, what was Jacob thinking?
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Well, part of it, he was kind of messed up himself.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   He was a deceiver.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   He stole his brother's birthright.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   He stole his brother's blessing.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   He ends up having to leave home.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   He ends up with his uncle, Laban, who is also a deceitful man.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   He falls in love with Rachel, so he wants to marry her.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   So Laban says, "Work for me seven years."
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   And after seven years, they're having their wedding ceremony,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   and he finds out the next morning he's married to Leah.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   I mean, for those of you who are single, imagine that happening.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   I mean, they did things a little differently.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   You didn't see her face, I guess, until the next morning.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And you wake up, and you're like, "Hey, hey, you're not the right one."
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Leah is unloved.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   But Jacob agrees to work seven more years so he can marry Rachel.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Rachel is loved, but she is barren.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Because she is barren, she gives her maidservant to Jacob
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   so that she could have children through her.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Leah ends up doing the same thing.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   This is a messy family.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   I mean, some of you who think your family life is messy, compare it to this.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Imagine growing up in that household.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Rachel ends up having Joseph, but when she gives birth to Benjamin, she dies.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   And so these 12 brothers and one sister are growing up in this family,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   this very dysfunctional family.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   On top of that, Jacob plays favorites.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Genesis 37.3, "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a very colored tunic.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   And his father saw that their father loved him more than all of his brothers,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   so they hated him and could not speak to him in peace."
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Parents showing favoritism to one of the children, bad.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Maybe some of you come from a family, no one will admit it, right?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Parents will always say, "No, we love you all equally."
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   But you secretly wonder, "No, I think you favor someone."
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Maybe there are three girls and one boy, at least in Korean culture.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   It's like the boy is always supposed to be the favorite one,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   so the girls might think, "Dad obviously loves the son more."
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Jacob actually didn't hide it.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   He gets him this--we don't know exactly what it looked like.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   I can only imagine it was very fancy and different from what his brothers had.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   They didn't have a lot of choices back then, too.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   They didn't have any colors.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   I have a daughter who goes to FIT in New York,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   and I'm learning more about fashion than I have ever cared to know
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   because there's so much involved.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   So imagine Joseph walking around in this coat,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   this bright, colorful coat that stands out.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   It's almost as if it's being rubbed in every day.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   "I am the chosen one."
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Well, the anti-bills--go to the next slide.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Joseph has a dream of sheaves.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   He says, "Hey, I had a dream of sheaves."
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   He was referring to his brothers.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   "And your sheaves bowed down to mine."
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   This is really just stoking the anger in his brothers.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   In Genesis 37 and 8, his brother said to him,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   "Are you really going to reign over us, or are you really going to rule over us?"
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Now, we don't have a lot of detail.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Some commentators say Joseph was a brat.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   In fact, there was one book I found that said, "From brat to something."
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   It's like, wow, that's kind of a harsh judgment.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   He was young for sure, definitely not wise.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   But who gave him the dream?
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   God gave him the dream.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Who knows? Maybe God asked him to share it.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   But as a 17-year-old--I don't know if there are any 17-year-olds.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   I don't know if you have all the wisdom in the world to know how to handle this
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   in this kind of family dynamic.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   But he shouldn't have been surprised.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   They already hated him.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   They hated him now even more.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   He has another dream--next slide--dream of the sun, moon, and stars bowing down to him.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   And now even Jacob, his father, says, "Rebuked him."
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Are we all going to bow down to you, Joseph?
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   But it says that he kind of kept these things in his mind.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Jacob's like, "What's going on here?
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Why is Joseph having these dreams?"
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   But his brothers, in Genesis 37, 11, it says his brothers were jealous of him.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   So this relationship is bad.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   It's really bad.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Now what were his brothers jealous about?
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   They were probably jealous about his coat.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   They were probably jealous about these dreams too
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   because there's something about them.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Is Joseph really going to be the one who rules over us?
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   He's a young guy.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Who is he to think that he has any kind of position like this?
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   But was it Joseph's fault?
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Or was it that the brothers' hearts were evil,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   full of envy, jealousy, reflecting their lack of fearing God?
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   You know, I'm sure that Jacob had shared with all of his children
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   the covenant promises that had been passed down from Abraham to Isaac to him.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   They surely must have heard all the stories.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   They had all the information, the same information that Joseph had.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   But what was their response?
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   They were hateful. They were jealous.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   In fact, they were murderous.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   They ended up selling their own brother into slavery.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   You know, there's kind of a big clue you can see from two of them at least,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Simeon and Levi.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   In Genesis 34, there's the story of Shechem who falls in love with Dinah,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   the daughter of Jacob.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   He lies with her, but he loves her.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   He wants to marry her.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   So long story short, the sons of Jacob make a deal and say,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   "Well, okay, if you want your people to marry our people,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   there's one condition.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   All the men need to be circumcised."
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Now, that's an awkward topic to talk about at church.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   But think about this.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   These are grown men who are going to be subjected to this process.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   They agree to it.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   And in Genesis 34, it says, "On the third day, while they were in pain,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Simeon and Levi went and slaughtered all the men."
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   They killed them all.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   James Boyce writes this regarding the misuse of appealing to the issue of circumcision.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   "The dreadful misuse of the holy.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   The sign of the covenant of God was appropriated by Shechem to gratify his lust,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   by Hamer, the father of Shechem, to increase his cattle,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   and by the sons of Jacob as a cover for murder.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   All had sinful motives, but of all the evil that of the sons of Jacob was worse,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   they used the pledge of God's favor, circumcision,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   to cloak their murderous intentions."
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   That's how evil these guys were.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   They used God's covenant symbol to kill all the men.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   That's why later on in Genesis 49, when Jacob is giving the blessing to all his sons,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   he doesn't give a blessing to Simeon and Levi.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   He says this, "Simeon and Levi are brothers.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   Their swords are implements of violence.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Let my soul not enter into their council.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Let not my glory be united with their assembly,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   because in their anger they killed men,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   and in their self-will they hamstrung oxen.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Cursed be their anger, for it is strong,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   and their wrath, for it is cruel.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   I will divide them amongst Jacob and scatter them in Israel."
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   It's interesting that later on in the story,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   when Joseph chooses one of the brothers to stay behind in Egypt,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   he chose Simeon.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Now, there's not much more information.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   We don't know if Simeon did anything particularly direct toward Joseph,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   but he was an example of how evil a brother he was.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Next slide.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   There's a reversal of fortune.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   Joseph goes from becoming the favored son,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   with dreams of ruling over his family,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   to now being cast in a pit.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   One day, Jacob sends Joseph to check on his brothers.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   They're shepherds.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   They're quite far away.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   He ends up locating them in Delphin.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   They see him from afar,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   and as he is approaching,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   they see him and they discuss killing him.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   Now, Reuben, who is the oldest,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   he tries to save Joseph's life by suggesting they just throw him in a pit,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   as he would have the intention to rescue Joseph later.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   But, while he is gone sometime in the interval,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   his brothers see an opportunity to make money.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   So, they sell Joseph to traders on their way to Egypt.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   So, Joseph has now literally gone from being the favored one,
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   to now being sold into slavery.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   This is quite a turn of events.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   This is not what Joseph had planned for his life.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   It would be the equivalent of,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   if you're 17, you're getting ready to go to college,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   and instead of going to college,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   you get sold into slavery.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   So, Joseph is sold to Potiphar in Egypt.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   He's captain of the guard for Pharaoh.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Joseph is a gifted and talented man.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   It shows that he really had the gift of administration and managing.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   He becomes a steward of Potiphar's estate.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   In fact, he takes care of everything so well,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   that all Potiphar had to care about was what he ate.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   But, Potiphar had a wife.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Potiphar's wife tries to seduce Joseph.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   She tries to seduce him daily.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   And, at one point, when everyone is outside of the house,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   she corners him, grabs him by his coat,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   says, "Lie with me."
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   And, Joseph flees,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   leaving his coat behind.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   She falsely accuses him of rape,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   so he is thrown into prison.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   And so, there's the next slide where he is tempted.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   And, he had done nothing wrong.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   He was a righteous man.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   It's interesting that he was thrown into prison.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Potiphar could have easily had Joseph executed,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   even just if there was the accusation.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Joseph was a slave.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   And, again, we don't have enough information here,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   but maybe Potiphar knew his wife.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Maybe he knew her character.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   So, he saw the integrity of Joseph.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   So, instead of having him executed,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   he put him in jail.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   But, even in jail.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   And so, from a human standpoint,
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   there's a fall from grace.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   You can go to the next slide.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   This false accusation takes Joseph,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   who has now kind of gone up the ladder.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   He's the overseer of Potiphar's estates.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   He's now a prisoner in jail.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Just when you think Joseph gets a break,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   it goes bad again.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   But, even when he is in jail,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   he shows his integrity.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   He shows his skills.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   He ends up taking care of the entire prison.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   And, what's interesting is,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   both in Potiphar's estate and in prison,
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Joseph is preparing for what he will be doing later.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   And, that is to manage all of Egypt.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Maybe God is using these situations to teach him
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   how to deal with people,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   how to deal with situations,
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   as he is given the great task.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   While he is in jail,
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   next slide,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Topher, were thrown out of the prison.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   They both have dreams.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   Joseph interprets both their dreams,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   and they come to pass.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   The cupbearer is restored,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   and the baker is executed.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   He implores the cupbearer to remember him,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   to say, "I was unjustly put in prison.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Please advocate for me."
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   But, it says that the cupbearer forgot him.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   So, he is in prison for two more years.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   But, then Pharaoh has two dreams.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   Next slide.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   No one can interpret them.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   And, the chief cupbearer remembers
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   and tells Pharaoh about Joseph.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   Joseph tells him that the dreams are one and the same.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Seven years of plenty will be followed
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   by seven years of famine.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   And so, because of this,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   Joseph is raised up to be prime minister of Egypt.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   As time goes by,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   the seven years of plenty pass,
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   and then the famine comes.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   And, because of the famine,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   his brothers come.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Next slide.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   And, in Genesis 42,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   verse 6, it says this,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   "Now Joseph was the one in power over the land.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   He was the one who sold to all the people of the land.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   And, Joseph's brothers came and bowed down to him
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   with their faces to the ground."
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   What has just happened?
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   It must have been such a surreal moment.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   The brothers don't recognize Joseph
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   because he's an Egyptian garb.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   He looks like an Egyptian.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   They think he's dead.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   But, Joseph recognizes them.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   But, what happens is his dream is fulfilled.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   His brothers are face down on the ground.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   And, it says there that Joseph remembered his dreams.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   But, he doesn't reveal himself immediately.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   Why?
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   Because he's going to test them
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   to see if they've changed.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   They tell about their brother Benjamin.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   They say that there is one who is no more.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   That's referring to Joseph.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   He accuses them of being spies.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   And, he says, "Well, this is what we'll do.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   I'm going to keep nine of you.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   I'm sorry, ten of you.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   And, we'll have you go.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   Nine of you.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   And, we'll send one."
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   He was testing them to see who would go get Benjamin.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   And, it's interesting to know.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   Wadi Bakr, in his message on this, says,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   "No one volunteered to go get Benjamin."
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Three days later, he changes his mind.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   He says, "Okay, I'll keep one of you and send the rest."
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Who will stay?
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   No one volunteers to stay either.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   This is something that's revealing the heart of the brothers.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Because, after they leave, the test is,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   would they come back for Simeon?
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   He keeps Simeon.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   These brothers are messed up.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   They don't care for Benjamin.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   They don't care for Simeon.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   They only care for themselves.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   They go back.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   And, there's so much more to the story here.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   They run out of food.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   They have to go back again.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   But, they tell Jacob, "We need to take Benjamin."
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   So, Jacob agrees.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   And, finally, when he comes, and again, more to the story,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   Joseph reveals himself.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   And, he ends up bringing Jacob and his family, all of them, to Egypt.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   So, that they would be cared for during the years of famine.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   If you look at Genesis chapter 50, there are just two points I want to really draw you to.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   First, the brothers meant evil.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   The brothers meant evil.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   You know, if there's anything that you can be sure about, evil is real.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   And, you know what?
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   Evil can happen even in your family.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   You know, as a pastor, that's one of the things I have to do a lot of counseling.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   You know, family issues.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   There can be hatred and jealousy.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Even murder.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   I mean, think about Cain and Abel.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   I mean, there are only four human beings on the planet.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   And, Cain hated Abel.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   He was envious of him because God accepted his sacrifice.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   So, what does he do?
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   He kills him.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   How do you do that?
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   I mean, how many of you have siblings?
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   So, at least you have siblings.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   Don't raise your hand on this though.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   Have you ever had thoughts of maybe at least hitting them?
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   Yeah, maybe take a shot at them.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   But, how about killing them?
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   Those were the brothers of Joseph.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   They hated him.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   They were envious.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   They sold him into slavery.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   You know, in Genesis chapter 3, when Adam and Eve, they're still in the garden.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   And, Satan tempts Eve to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   She eats it.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   Adam eats it.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   And, now they know evil.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   It's not just they know it.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   They are it.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   There's now evil in their hearts.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Sin has enslaved them.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   And, when sin enslaves you, evil words, evil thoughts, evil deeds all come out.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   Why? Because of an evil heart.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   You know, Joseph's brothers, they never fully dealt with the evil in their hearts until the very end.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   Genesis 50.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   Because, when Jacob dies, they're afraid that Joseph is going to take revenge.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   They know that Joseph loved Jacob.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   And, they thought maybe he didn't do anything because dad was here.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   But, now that dad is gone, what if he takes revenge?
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   What it reveals is that they had fear in their hearts.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   Joseph had already forgiven them.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   He had already restored them.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   In Genesis 45, it says when he revealed himself, he wept.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   He wept on their necks.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   He welcomed them.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   He talked to each one of them.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   He forgave them.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   And yet, 17 years later, they're still scared.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   Why? They had never themselves fully confessed their sin toward Joseph.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   In fact, in Genesis 50, when their father is dead, they send a message to Joseph.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   They still can't even tell him directly.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   In Genesis 50.17, in the message, it says, "This is what our father has commanded.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   Thus, you shall say to Joseph, 'Please forgive, I beg you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   For they dealt evil against you.'"
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   Now, they are actually communicating.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   They're owning up to their evil.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   They knew they were evil.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   And, they knew Joseph had shown them grace.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   Joseph wept when he heard these words.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   Why?
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   Because his heart must have been broken.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   He had already forgiven them.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   But, it was the right time for them now to finally confess.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   So, that's why in Genesis 50.20, he says, "As for you, you meant evil against me."
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   He recognizes it.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   They were indeed evil.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   They were truly evil.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   There was nothing positive about them.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   But still, he forgave them.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   He restored them.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   To me, that's such an amazing picture.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   I have extended family.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   We have quite a lot of drama in my family.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   It's a large family.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   There's enough drama there.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   But, then becoming a pastor, I wish you could do a TV series on Korean church drama.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   Because, it's even better than what's there.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Like, reality is stranger than fiction.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   There's been so much pain and hurt.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   I mean, in church planting, it's been difficult.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   Because, in every church, there's been betrayal.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   And, betrayal only happens when they're your close friend.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   There are times where I just could not understand why.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   I could not understand why.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   But, here's the reality.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   As man is doing evil, God is working out good.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   Somehow, in God's mysterious providence, he exercises his sovereignty.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   So, in ways that we cannot see, God's goodness is going to prevail.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   Next slide.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   This is called the doctrine of concurrence.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   God is working.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   And, I am working.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   I don't see everything that God is doing.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   Because, I'm limited by my humanity.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   I'm finite.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   I'm linear.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   I can only see from this point on.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   I can't see the future.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   But, God has the whole picture in mind.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   And, he has good in store.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   Do you think Joseph knew where he was heading with all this?
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   When he got sold into slavery?
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   When he went into prison?
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   He had no idea.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   But, God did.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   God had something good.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   Joseph literally becomes a savior for Egypt.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   But, he's especially a savior for his family.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Small S savior.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   There's only one big S savior.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   So, even though all this evil is happening, God is accomplishing good.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   Next slide.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   In verses 19 to 21, there's such perspective.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Verse 19 of Genesis 50, "But Joseph said to them, 'Do not be afraid, for am I in God's place?'"
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   That's something so important to understand.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   Joseph himself knew he was not in control.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   He was not the one in power.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   He didn't have the authority.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   I'm not God.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   So, don't be afraid.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   Brothers, do not be afraid.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   I know I am not in God's place.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   Yes, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   You know, there's so many times people question the goodness of God.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   Maybe you even question the goodness of God.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   I've questioned the goodness of God.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   There are times I would just be in despair, because I couldn't understand.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   I couldn't understand what was going on.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   If God is so good, why does he let these things happen?
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   You know, for an unbeliever, they will question God's goodness when there are hard times.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   But, that's understandable.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   They don't know God.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   They don't know his heart.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   They don't know his plan.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   They don't understand his character.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   But, how about you?
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   If you're a Christian, could you say these words?
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   "God means good."
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   God always means good.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   Even through the suffering, the injustice, the false accusations, the disappointment, the loneliness.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   What do you think kept Joseph going?
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   You know, he didn't have a theology book.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   He didn't even have a Bible then.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   I think it was Joel Beakey who said that even if they had a Bible, it would only have gone up to Genesis chapter 36.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   But, they didn't have things like that back then, like we do.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   But, he had been taught the truth.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   And, what was the one truth that he really understood?
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   God is good.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   And, that sustained him through all of it.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   I mean, even as you could imagine Joseph pondering the question, "God, why?"
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   What sustained him?
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   He trusted in God's goodness.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   He trusted in his providential directing.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   Genesis 45, "For God sent me before you."
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   You didn't send me. God sent me.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   Verse 7, "God sent me before you to establish for you a remnant."
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   There was a greater purpose.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   He didn't know it at the time, but as he looks back.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   And, see, that's when you can look back and see God's providential leading in your life.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   He is the one taking you down the path that you have gone.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   He was taken 300 miles away from his home into slavery to serve Potter for languish in prison.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   Forgotten by those he had helped.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   Now, he is 30 years old.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   And, for about 14 years, as he went through all the hardships,
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   he was sustained by the truth that God always means good.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   James Boyce writes this, "What gave Joseph the grace to make this remarkable reply?
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   There is only one answer.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   Joseph knew God.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   In particular, he knew two things about God.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   He knew that God is sovereign, that nothing ever comes into the life of any one of his children
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   that he has not approved first.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   There are no accidents.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   He knew that God is good, therefore the things that come into our lives by God's sovereignty
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   are for our benefit, and for others, and not for our harm."
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   Romans wasn't written yet, but if there is one verse that Joseph could have said he stood on,
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   it was Romans 8:28.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   "And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   for those who are called according to his purpose."
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   And what was that purpose in verse 29?
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   That they would become conformed to the image of his son.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   That's something I want to really encourage you to consider.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   You want to know why?
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   Well, you're not going to know all the answers to that,
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   but there is one answer you can know.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   God wants to conform you into the image of his son.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   So everything, it is not accidental, everything you go through is meant to point you to Christ,
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   to trust him, to love him, to follow him, and to be like him.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   That is the good.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   Now, of course, we're still humans, and we struggle.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   Well, real quickly, let's look at the third point, the last point, the example of Joseph.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   I'm going to highlight four things about him.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   And overall, Joseph ultimately showed he lived a life of faith.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   He trusted God.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   That's what kept him going all that time.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   And this is how he showed it.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   First, Joseph truly lived a God-centered life.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   He lived a God-centered life.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   There are so many verses here where I could reference, but I'll just mention a few.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   When he's talking to Potiphar's wife, as she's trying to tempt him, his response is,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   "How then could I do this great evil and sin against God?"
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   He didn't care so much about her.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   He didn't care about Potiphar.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   He cared about God.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   And when the cupbearer and the baker come, and they tell him his dreams in Genesis 40,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   he says, "Do not interpretations belong to God?"
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   It wasn't him.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   God was the one who gave him the interpretations.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   And even when he faces Pharaoh in Genesis 41, 16, he says, "It is not in me.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   God will answer."
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   You see, everything about Joseph was about God.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   It wasn't about his own ability.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   It wasn't about his own skills, talents.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   It was about God.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   Even when he named his children, God gives him a wife and two sons.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   The first one is Manasseh.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   And it means, "God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household."
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   And every time he looked at Manasseh, he probably couldn't imagine, "I can't believe I'm here.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   God has blessed me so much.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   I have forgotten my troubles."
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   His second son is Ephraim.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   "God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   You see, even in his children, he recognizes God's hand at work.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   Second, Joseph had God's providence at the center of his perspective.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   That phrase, "God meant it for good."
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   I've already talked a little bit about it.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   But imagine if you wake up each day and start off with this commitment.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   "God, I know you mean today for good, no matter what happens.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   No matter what happens, good or bad.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   Even if someone treats me with evil, even with murderous intentions."
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   You know, that's the sad thing in this life.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   You never know who's going to stab you in the back.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   It could be a family member, a friend.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   It could be a fellow church member.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   You have no control over that.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   But what you do have control over is this.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   "I will see God's providential hand at work, that he is working out good."
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   You know, when I was in Korea a few weeks ago,
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   there were certain friends that messaged me.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   And they said, "What are you doing in Korea?
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   I thought you hated Koreans."
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   Because I did.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   I was at a church in Maryland, and that church destroyed me.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   And because of that church, I didn't want to be a pastor anymore.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   And because of that church, I hated Koreans.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   I wanted Koreans to go to hell.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   Then I thought planting a second-generation church would be better.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   And I found out it's not.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   Same problems.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   But I had to work out this bitterness and resentment in my heart.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   To say I'm racist against only one race, Koreans.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   It was true.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   Then I read Romans 9 and saw Paul's heart for his own people.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   And I was so ashamed.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   How could I wish people to go to hell?
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   Paul wished he could go to hell for his own people.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   But you know what? God used all of it.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   He used the crushing of my life during that time
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   to help me see his grace and mercy in even a greater way.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   Several years ago, I had several herniated discs.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   I was bedridden for about a year.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   I'm still kind of recovering.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   That was humbling.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   I couldn't do anything.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   I felt completely useless.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   But God used that for good, too.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   My oldest daughter walked away from the faith.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   Lives in rebellion toward God.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   It is the most heartbreaking thing in my life.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   I would trade everything in the world.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   I'd be willing to die for her.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   So that she would just know Jesus.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   And even in that, I have to trust God is intending good.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   It makes all the difference in the world.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   If you can wake up each day and end each day,
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   say, "God, I trust that you are working out good."
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   Thirdly, Joseph had a love of God continually expressed.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   In Genesis 50-21, he tells them,
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   "So now do not be afraid, for I will provide for you and your little ones."
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   And he comforted them and spoke to their heart.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   Joseph was amazing.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   Not only did he forgive them, he reassured them.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   "Do not be afraid."
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   He mentions that twice.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   And he says, "Not only am I going to take care of you,
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   I'm going to take care of your children."
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   And it says that he spoke to their heart.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   There's something about the love of Christ being expressed
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   in such a way that you speak to someone's heart,
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   even to the ones that hurt you the most.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   My father was not a Christian growing up.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   He was a typical Korean man, first generation, only cared about school.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   I talked to him twice a year, report car time.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   I got beaten often.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   He was not a kind man.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   And then God saved him.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   I used to think, "God, I'm not going to pray for my dad anymore
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   because he seems like he's getting worse.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   So maybe if I stop praying, he won't get worse."
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   No, you don't do that.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   But even through that, God provided such perspective.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   My father changed so much.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   He passed away a few years ago, but God changed his life.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   He was such a gentle person, so kind, taught me so much.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   He showed me, "How do you love those?"
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   He had three brothers who made his life miserable,
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   but he showed such grace and kindness to them.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   Lastly, Joseph lived with God's presence always in mind.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   There are a number of times, Genesis 39.2, it says this,
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   "Yahweh was with Joseph."
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   Genesis 39.3, "Now his master saw that Yahweh was with him."
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   Genesis 39.5, "Yahweh blessed the Egyptians' house on account of Joseph."
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   Genesis 39.21, "But Yahweh was with Joseph."
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   I'm quoting from the LSB.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   I appreciate that the covenant name of God is used here
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   when it says that Yahweh was with Joseph.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   Joseph had something that brought complete confidence and assurance to him.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   The covenant name of God, the name that was given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   that was passed down, that he had cut a covenant with Abraham unilaterally,
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   and he promised, and he would fulfill.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   So Joseph knew God as Immanuel, God with us.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   These are the ways in which Joseph was able to face all the hardships of his life.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   I want to close with Romans 8.28 again.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   You can show the last slide--next slide, sorry.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   God was working out good through the whole process.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   So if you look at the arc of his life, the pit, prison,
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   and then becoming prime minister of Egypt,
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   Romans 8.28 was the truth that he banked on.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   The Scottish minister, Andrew Bonar, in his Bible,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   he wrote on Romans 8.28 this phrase,
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   "A pillow upon which the troubled believer may rest his head."
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   A couple years ago, I was listening to the sermon by another pastor
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   and was given this thought.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   I don't sleep so well, and I've tried many pillows.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   I don't know if any of you have problems with pillows.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   I've tried so many pillows. No pillow works.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   But there is one pillow that actually does.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   It's the Romans 8.28 pillow.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   When you lie your head down at night, you can put your head down.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   You can actually sleep in peace
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   because you know that God is working out all things for good
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   to those who love him and are called according to his purpose.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   Let's bow in prayer.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   And as we pray, I want to just share,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   if there's anyone here who does not know Christ as Savior and Lord,
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   it is hard to make sense of the hardships of life.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   And apart from Christ, there actually is no answer.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   But in Christ, we know that we have forgiveness of sins.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   Even those as evil as Joseph's brothers could be saved from their sins.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   Joseph was still a sinner. He needed to be saved too.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   In fact, we're all sinners.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   We've all sinned against a holy God.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   We all deserve condemnation.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   That's why Jesus Christ came.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   Joseph, in many ways, is a picture of Christ as a Savior.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   But there's a greater Savior.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   There's a greater Joseph.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   Jesus.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   He died the death that we deserved.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   He rose again.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   He has conquered sin and death.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   And he presents the free gift of eternal life.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   If we come and repent, trust in him alone, and follow him.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   And for you, believer, be assured that in the midst of maybe all the things you're going through in life now,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   look to Christ.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   Fix your eyes on him.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   Trust him.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   Trust in the goodness of God to sustain you.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   Because it will prevail.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much that we have been given this time.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   Thank you for the life of Joseph, which is such a beautiful picture of one who ultimately did trust you.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   He trusted in your providential hand, even though he couldn't see.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   We thank you for the great example that Joseph knew that you were with him every step of the way.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   He feared you.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   He loved you.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   He trusted you.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   And he did that to show an example to us so that we, too, might be like him.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   That we would know that you always mean good, even though people mean evil.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   May we trust you as we face the challenges of life and know that it is enough.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   You are enough.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   You will sustain us to the very end.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   So may we look to the great truth that all things do work together for a good,
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   for those who love him and are called according to his purpose.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   May you imprint that on our hearts and minds.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   May we live that out to your glory.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   Thank you for the closing song.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   [Music]
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   O my waking breath, O my daily breath,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   For the sun to rise, for my sleep at night,
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   You're the way, the truth, and the light.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   I'm the bridge and you are the vine.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   Draw me close and teach me to apply.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   You're sweet as a flower.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   I depend on you, oh I depend on you.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   You're sweet as every flower.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   I depend on you, oh I depend on you.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   You're the way, the truth, and the light.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   I'm the bridge and you are the vine.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   Draw me close and teach me to apply.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   Be my strength, strong in the night.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   Be my all, my treasure, my pride.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   I am yours forever, you're mine.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   Draw me close and teach me to apply.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   When I pass through death, as I enter Christ,
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:06.000]   You're eternal, to be raised with pride.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   I depend on you, oh I depend on you.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   You're the way, the truth, and the light.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   I'm the bridge and you are the vine.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   Draw me close and teach me to apply.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   Be my strength, strong in the night.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   Be my all, my treasure, my pride.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   I am yours forever, you're mine.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   Draw me close and teach me to apply.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   I depend on you.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   Oh, I depend on you.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   Oh, I depend on you.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   And I depend on you.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   I depend on you.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   And I depend on you.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   I depend on you.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   Oh, I depend on you.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   You're the way, the truth, and the light.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   I'm the bridge and you are the vine.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   Draw me close and teach me to apply.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   Be my strength, strong in the night.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   Be my all, my treasure, my pride.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   I am yours forever, you're mine.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   Draw me close and teach me to apply.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   I close with a benediction.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   beyond all that we ask or understand,
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   according to the power that works within us,
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   to all generations forever and ever.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   Amen.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   God sent his son.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   They called him Jesus.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   He came to love.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   Heal and forgive.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   He wept and died.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   To buy my body, an empty grave,
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000]   is there to prove my Savior lives.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   And life is worth living just because he lives.
