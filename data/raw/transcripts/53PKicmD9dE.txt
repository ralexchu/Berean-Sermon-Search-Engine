[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.240]   - All right, good morning church family.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.240]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.240]   I hope you had a good week in the Lord.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.240]   As always, it's a privilege for us
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.160]   to gather and to worship our God together on Sunday.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.160]   And I'm reminded today of just God's great love for us
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160]   and that while we were yet sinners,
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.160]   that Christ would die for us.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160]   And so we're gonna sing the first song,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.160]   "You Made Us Your Own."
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160]   And just as we sing these lyrics
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.160]   and as we sing this as a praise,
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160]   may we be reminded of his great love for us
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.160]   that Christ would die for us
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.160]   and through faith in him
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160]   that we would be adopted into the family of God
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160]   and we could be considered a child of God
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.160]   and how amazing that is.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160]   And so let us give thanks to him from our hearts.

[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:21.080]   Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.080]   If this is your first time with us,
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.080]   we have a welcome table outside if you can join us there
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.080]   and you can ask any questions that you have,
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.080]   fill out a card for us, that'd be helpful.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.080]   We have four announcements.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.080]   First one is the Men's Ministry Fellowship,
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.080]   which is happening in two Saturdays
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.080]   in the cafe at 9 a.m.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.080]   It's going to be $10 a person,
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.080]   so please come and join us for that.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.080]   We're gonna be having a panel of men
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.080]   kind of just giving their thoughts on things,
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.080]   questions that we might have for them will be answered.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.080]   Secondly, we have a regional Thanksgiving dinner
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.080]   sign-ups continuing.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.080]   That is going to be happening on November 24th at 5 p.m.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.080]   We want to invite everybody to sign up for that.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.080]   They're in smaller houses,
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.080]   and it's an easier way to get to know people,
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.080]   especially as our church continues to grow.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.080]   Third, we have Berean men's and women's flag football.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.080]   It is just gonna be a single day,
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.080]   the Saturday right after Thanksgiving.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.080]   So if you want to be--if you want to sign up for that,
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.080]   the QR code is up here.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.080]   And then lastly, for one of our spotlights
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.080]   to the various things we do during the holidays,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.080]   we have the Brookdale Assisted Living caroling.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   So on Saturday, December 7th at 9.30,
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.080]   we're gonna be going to Brookdale in Anaheim,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.080]   and we're going to be singing Christmas carols to them,
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.080]   sharing the gospel with them,
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.080]   spending time with those senior residents.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.080]   So if you have--if you look at your calendar
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.080]   and you happen to have time that morning,
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.080]   if you could come and join us to be a part of that,
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.080]   we can share the gospel with them.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.080]   All right, well, if you have a physical offering,
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.080]   there's an offering basket--or a box in the back,
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.080]   or you can give it on our online methods.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.080]   Would you bow your heads with me,
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.080]   and I'll pray for offering.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.080]   Oh, Father, we thank you.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.080]   Lord, even as our Taiwan team is out and about
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.080]   and making their way back to us now,
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.080]   Lord, that you have given us opportunity,
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.080]   even in the giving of our offering,
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.080]   to further your kingdom.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.080]   Lord, that we know that your desire
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.080]   is for your name to be made known
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.080]   to the ends of the earth.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.080]   And so, Father, I pray that our heart would be the same.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.080]   In our smaller capacity sometimes, Lord,
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.080]   we can kind of isolate it.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.080]   But, Lord, that we would have a broader perspective
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.080]   and that we would freely give
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.080]   because we know that that's what matters.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.080]   Help us to give from our hearts.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.080]   Help us to give to what matters.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.080]   Thank you so much, Lord.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.080]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.680]   and let us take this opportunity to greet those around us.

[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.680]   Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.680]   Put on the full armor of God so that you will be able to stand firm
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.680]   against the schemes of the devil.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.680]   For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.680]   but against the rulers, against the powers,
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.680]   against the world forces of this darkness,
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.680]   against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.680]   Therefore, take up the full armor of God
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.680]   so that you will be able to resist in the evil day
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.680]   and having done everything, to stand firm.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.680]   Heavenly Father, I pray, God, that you would help us
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.680]   to see the reality of the enemy today,
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   that it might draw us to not simply fight in the war,
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.680]   but Lord, to cling to Christ.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.680]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:32.680]   I've been studying,
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:37.680]   personally, angels and demons lately.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.680]   And so I might have had some of that conversation
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.680]   with some people, but it has led me to this
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   because as that was going on in me,
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.680]   as I was studying those things,
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.680]   I was trying to prevent myself from going too far into it.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.680]   And at the same time, I realized how much awareness
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.680]   it brought to me.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.680]   It just immediately caused me to be much more sober
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.680]   on a general level.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   And so that's how I ended up on this passage to share,
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.680]   even though I know we've looked at this passage
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.680]   over the last couple years as well.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.680]   I think the problem is not that we don't know
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.680]   that spiritual warfare is real.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.680]   I think the problem is that because it's invisible
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.680]   and we have a tendency to put our eyes on the visible
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   and especially in a westernized setting that we're in,
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.680]   it's simple to attribute things to physical things
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.680]   where the scriptures are very clear
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.680]   that there is a spiritual warfare going on around us.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.680]   And I know that's the case for me
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.680]   because if we look at a passage, for example,
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.680]   like 1 Peter 5.8, it says that your adversary, the devil,
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   he prowls around like a roaring lion.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.680]   He's seeking someone to devour is what it says.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   And if you can imagine with me something like a cage,
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.680]   if you remember those Ringley brothers,
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.680]   the people that worked with that tiger?
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.680]   I can't remember their names right now,
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   but they have a cage here and it was right here.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   There's a cage literally physically up here on stage
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.600]   and there's a tiger in there or a lion or whatever
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.600]   and this is an untamed tiger.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.600]   Let's put it that way.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.600]   And the man comes and just opens it up, opens the door up.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.600]   Every single one of us, if we're not running out that door,
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.600]   we're very, very aware of that lion.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.600]   We're very aware of the danger that's being presented here.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.600]   There's no one that's going to be looking
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.600]   and thinking about what they're going to eat after
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.600]   or having small talk about the baseball game after.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.600]   It's not going to be like that.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.600]   Everyone is watching this lion
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.600]   because that's the obvious response.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.600]   No one has to tell you to do that.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.600]   If it is the reality, that's what comes up out of us.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.600]   It's pretty simple.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.600]   And so that's how I know
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.600]   that I'm not sure if we're fully convinced that this is true.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.600]   It says that the enemy is prowling around like a roaring lion
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.600]   seeking someone to devour.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.600]   And other than just interesting and fascinating thoughts
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.600]   that pass through our minds,
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.600]   we just kind of move on and continue to live our lives,
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.600]   fight against our sin,
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.600]   talk about things that are going on,
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.600]   and it's not very intentionally understanding
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.600]   and remembering and recognizing
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.600]   the power of the enemy that is at work.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.600]   The scriptures say that demons are real,
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.600]   that they are nearby,
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.600]   that they're around, they're at work,
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.600]   they're scheming,
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.600]   they're deceiving.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.600]   The scriptures also describe these demons
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.600]   as intelligent and powerful.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.600]   We looked at it a little bit in Luke,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.600]   a little bit, maybe a few,
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.600]   about a month ago or so.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.600]   And so today I'd like to bring us back to this reality
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.600]   to remember again why it's so vital for us
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   to remember that the enemy is near,
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   that the enemy is real.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.600]   If we forget that he's prowling,
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.600]   then we're going to stop resisting.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.600]   If we forget that he's actually around
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.600]   and that he's trying to do something,
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.600]   then he is going to cause us to be blinded
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.600]   or we are going to blind ourselves
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.600]   or something like that,
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.600]   and our resistance is going to dissolve.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.600]   We're not going to have the ability to stand firm.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   If somebody is telling you,
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.600]   "Be careful, be careful,"
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.600]   and that's all they do,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.600]   they say, "Be careful, be careful," like that.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.600]   I mean, it's just going to be a command that's given
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   and perhaps if you trust in the source,
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   then you're going to be like,
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   "Oh, I've got to be careful about something."
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   But the Bible just simply says
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.600]   he's here and he's near and he's prowling.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   And so we would be careful just by knowing that.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.600]   The scriptures describe a broad perspective
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.600]   of the enemy.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.600]   He's not just a personal enemy.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.600]   He's not just an enemy
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   that goes after us as individuals.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.600]   He's in every layer.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.600]   He's in our families,
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.600]   threatening to tear apart.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.600]   He's in our church.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.600]   He's in the fabric of society.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.600]   He's in our government.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.600]   It's not very difficult to see the fruit of that
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.600]   as the enemy has continued working.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   It isn't the healthiest thing
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.600]   to find Satan under every rock,
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.600]   but the scriptures just clearly tell us
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.600]   what we are struggling against.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   So we'll be going through three points here.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.600]   The reality of the enemy,
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   secondly, the fight against the enemy,
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   and thirdly, the application.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.600]   So first, we're going to look at
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.600]   the reality of the enemy.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   If you could look at Ephesians 6, verse 12 with me.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   Verse 12.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.600]   "but against the rulers, against the powers,
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   "against the world forces of this darkness,
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.600]   "against the spiritual forces of wickedness
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.600]   "and the heavenly places."
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.600]   He clearly states up front
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.600]   that we are not struggling against flesh and blood.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.600]   He has to tell us that.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.600]   Why?
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.600]   Because our eyes just draw to what is visible.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.600]   So if something's going awry,
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.600]   we're looking to see what's going on
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.600]   and we're trying to attribute it to something,
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.600]   but he says, "Hey, it's not against flesh and blood."
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.600]   And then he begins to describe the demonic realm.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.600]   The first word he uses to describe the demonic realm,
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.600]   he doesn't just say Satan and demons,
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   he uses this word "rulers."
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.600]   Rulers.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   It's translated just as that, as rulers
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   or perhaps powers,
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   because they're powerful beings with great authority.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   Did you know that Satan and the demons,
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   they have authority?
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.600]   Not of their own making,
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:55.600]   but one that has been bestowed to them by God.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:01.600]   Rulers can also be translated as the beginning or first.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.600]   Like there's something that would trigger in you
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   an idea of like primacy.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   Now obviously we're thinking Christ is there in that place,
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.600]   but there's a reason why Paul uses the language he does
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.600]   to talk about Christ being the prime one.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:21.600]   Here it's in that word, rulers, he's up top.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   Some will even say that they're heavenly beings
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.600]   fallen from glory, the first created.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.600]   The second word used there is powers, against the powers.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.600]   A similar flair, authorities, powers.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.600]   This word can actually be used to describe a tribunal.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.600]   There's a great power and authority
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   in the hands of this realm.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.600]   And then it goes on to say world forces of this darkness.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.600]   The word forces is another word for rulers.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   World rulers over darkness.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.600]   So they are powerful.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.600]   They're not just rulers of a little place.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.600]   These are world rulers.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.600]   Government rulers.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:08.600]   This is an angelic world that has this authority.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.600]   Spiritual forces of wickedness in heavenly places
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.600]   is the last way they're described.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.600]   Wicked spirits, in other words.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.600]   And they're described as how or where are they
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.600]   in the heavenly places.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:26.600]   See, he chooses to describe this realm.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:30.600]   He doesn't just say, hey, be aware, Satan is here.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.600]   You're not fighting against flesh and blood,
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.600]   you're fighting against Satan.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.600]   He doesn't say that.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   He doesn't say you're fighting against demons.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.600]   He doesn't say things like that.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.600]   He's talking about all of these forces
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.600]   that are kind of coming together.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.600]   That evil co-mingles and that demons have a power
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:51.600]   and authority ascribed to them by God.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   You can say that they have power, authority,
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   dominion, and rulership.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.600]   We're going to look at a number of passages here.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.600]   What I want these passages to do
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.600]   is to remind us of the reality of the enemy.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.600]   I know we know in our minds
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.600]   that some of these passages are not going to be new to us,
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.600]   but we have to not treat the text
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.600]   as some ancient text filled with fables or fantasy.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.600]   This is reality.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.600]   Job chapter 1, verse 6, it says,
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.600]   "Now there was a day when the sons of God,"
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.600]   and we know those to be the angelic realm,
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.600]   the angels and the demons,
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.600]   "they came to present themselves before the Lord,
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.600]   "and Satan also came among them.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.600]   "The Lord said to Satan, 'From where do you come?'
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.600]   "Then Satan answered the Lord and said,"
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.600]   and this is frightening.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.600]   He says, "From roaming about on the earth."
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.600]   Now, that's frightening because who roams on the earth?
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.600]   We do.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.600]   We roam on the earth.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:50.600]   And Satan enters into, you know, the throne room of God,
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   and he says, "Where did you come from?"
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.600]   He says, "I was just there on the earth,
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   "roaming around, walking on the earth."
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.600]   Isaiah chapter 14, verse 12 says,
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.600]   "How you have fallen from heaven,
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.600]   "O star of the morning, sun of the dawn!
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.600]   "You have been cut down to the earth,
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.600]   "you who have weakened the nations."
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:13.600]   Again, heaven to earth, cut down to the earth.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.600]   The enemy is prowling like a roaring lion.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   Psalm 82.5 says, "They do not know,
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.600]   "nor do they understand.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.600]   "They walk about in darkness.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.600]   "All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.600]   "I said, 'You are gods,
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.600]   "'and all of you are sons of the Most High.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.600]   "'Nevertheless, you will die like men
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.600]   "'and fall like any one of the princes.'"
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.600]   Now, the next passage we're gonna look at
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.600]   is a story, is a narrative.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.600]   And this was one of the more surprising passages to me
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.600]   because when I stumbled across it,
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.600]   I couldn't remember going through it
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.600]   the many times I've gone through the book of 1 Kings.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.600]   1 Kings is just a narrative
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.600]   of kings going up and down.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   And it says in the middle of this,
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   talking about a man named Micaiah
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.600]   who's a great high priest,
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.600]   in chapter 22, verse 19,
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.600]   Micaiah said, "Therefore, hear the word of the Lord.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.600]   "I saw the Lord sitting on his throne."
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.600]   So the setting is heaven in God's throne room.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.600]   And it says, "All the hosts of heaven,"
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.600]   these are the angels,
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   "standing by him on his right and on his left."
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.600]   This is talking about places of authority.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.600]   "The Lord said, 'Who will entice Ahab
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.600]   "'to go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?'
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.600]   "And one said this while another said that."
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.600]   What a funny picture, isn't it?
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   I don't know if funny is the right word for this.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.600]   This is very, very fascinating.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.600]   You have these spirits,
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.600]   these angels who are beginning to talk with one another.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   "Then a spirit came forward
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   "and stood before the Lord
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.600]   "and said, 'I will entice him.'
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.600]   "The Lord said to him, 'How?'
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   "And he said, 'I will go out
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   "'and be a deceiving spirit
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.600]   "'in the mouth of all his prophets.'
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.600]   "Then he said, 'You are to entice him
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.600]   "'and also prevail.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.600]   "'Go and do so.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.600]   "'Now, therefore, behold,
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.600]   "'the Lord has put a deceiving spirit
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.600]   "'in the mouth of all these, your prophets,
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.600]   "'and the Lord has proclaimed disaster against you.'"
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.600]   So what this narrative is showing
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.600]   is that there are angels and demons
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.600]   who are in the presence of God
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.600]   and that they have been given
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:12.600]   some form of authority, power, dominion, and rulers.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.600]   And this evil spirit, this demonic spirit,
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.600]   had something that he was given to
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.600]   to be able to go and enact something
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.600]   that would be considered evil.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.600]   And this was to a king.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.600]   This wasn't just to some random person.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:35.600]   This was to influence a kingdom.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   So God sovereignly gives them authority to do this.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.600]   And they have great power, then,
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.600]   to deceive those who would place their faith in them.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   And we see such passages in Deuteronomy 4, verse 19.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   It says, "And beware not to lift up your eyes to heaven
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.600]   "and see the sun and the moon and the stars,
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.600]   "all the host of heaven."
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.600]   Host of heaven is a very important phrase.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.520]   We're gonna pass by.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.520]   "And be drawn away,"
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.520]   and he says, "and worship them and serve them,
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.520]   "those which the Lord your God has allotted
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:09.520]   "to all the peoples under the whole heaven.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.520]   "But the Lord has taken you
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.520]   "and brought you out of the iron furnace from Egypt
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.520]   "to be a people for his own possession as today."
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.520]   And so when you look at a passage like this,
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.520]   you have to start doing that work
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.520]   of thinking, like, how would this actually play out?
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.520]   Is it that there was an ancient people
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.520]   and that they looked at the sun and the moon and the stars
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.520]   and then they began just to bow down and worship to them?
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.520]   No, when you see the way it actually plays out,
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.520]   you begin to see, even with the Egyptians,
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.520]   that there are deities ascribed to them, right?
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.520]   There are deities that are connected to them.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.520]   And so the images that we unearth of the Baals,
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.520]   the images that we unearth in ancient Egypt
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.520]   are of actual beings, right?
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.520]   It's just very fascinating stuff.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.520]   And we're not gonna go too deep into that,
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.520]   but the idea is that these people,
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.520]   they looked up to the host of heaven
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:02.520]   and they were worshiping, serving.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.520]   Later on in Deuteronomy, it goes a little bit deeper.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.520]   In Deuteronomy 32.17, it says,
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:13.520]   "They sacrificed to demons who were not God."
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.520]   He just names them.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.520]   They're demons.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.520]   "To gods whom they have not known,
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:23.520]   new gods who came lately, whom your fathers did not dread."
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.520]   And so imagine the great influence that this enemy has.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.520]   This enemy, they are rulers.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.520]   They are powers.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.520]   We see the lingering reality of this in the New Testament.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.520]   Powerful rulers and authorities.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.520]   Look at 1 Corinthians 2.6.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.520]   "Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.520]   "A wisdom, however, not of this age,"
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.520]   and he says, "Nor of the rulers of this age
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.520]   "who are passing away.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.520]   "The wisdom which none of the rulers of this age
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.520]   "has understood.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.520]   "For if they had understood,
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.520]   "they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.520]   It's talking about these rulers of this age.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.520]   And my temptation was always just to look at words like this
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.520]   and just be like, these are kings.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.520]   These are humans who are placed in powers
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.520]   or perhaps they're just governments.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.520]   But 1 Corinthians talks about the rulers of this age.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.520]   If you look at Colossians 2.15, it says,
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.520]   "When he had disarmed the rulers and authorities,
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.520]   "he made a public display of them,
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:31.520]   "having triumphed over them through him."
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.520]   We know in Scripture that there's a cosmic war going on right now.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.520]   We know that that happens.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.520]   We know that the angels are there to aid men.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.520]   And when we look at these passages,
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.520]   it shows us this reality of the demonic.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.520]   And so to bring us to Ephesians.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.520]   We're in Ephesians 6.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.520]   We're going to look at three different passages
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.520]   in Ephesians that lead to it.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.520]   Look at this.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.520]   Ephesians 1.20, "Which he brought about in Christ
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.520]   "when he raised him from the dead
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.520]   "and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places."
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.520]   So there's very something specific
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.520]   that God is trying to portray here.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:17.520]   That God defeated the power of death.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:21.520]   The forces of evil, he defeated it.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.520]   And he raises Christ at the right hand where?
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.520]   In the heavenly places.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.520]   And he says in verse 21, using specific words,
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.520]   "Far above all rule, all authority,
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.520]   "and power, and dominion."
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.520]   And he says, "Every name, every name,
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.520]   "not only in this age, but also in the one to come."
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.440]   "And he put all things in subjection under his feet
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.440]   "and gave him as head over all things to the church."
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.440]   And again, this is not just talking about humanity.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.440]   He is talking about everything.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.440]   "When Christ is ascribed this authority,
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.440]   "it means that he is the king of all kings,
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.440]   "Lord of all lords.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.440]   "That he is going to be the one,
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.440]   "whether on heaven, or on earth,
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.440]   "or under the earth."
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.440]   And we're like, what, who, who, and who?
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   We just think about these things.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.440]   We think like, oh, it's just all creation,
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.440]   all humans, things like that.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.440]   This includes the angelic realm.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:22.440]   That Jesus came to disarm the rulers and authorities.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.440]   Man, they have great power.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.440]   Ephesians chapter two, verse one.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.440]   "You were dead in your trespasses and sins
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.440]   "in which you formerly walked
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.440]   "according to the course of this world,
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.440]   "according to the prince, the power of the air,
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.440]   "of the spirit that is now working
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.440]   "in the sons of disobedience."
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.440]   If there are sons, then there is a father.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.440]   So it talks about Satan as the father of lies.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.440]   It talks about the prince of the power of the air.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.440]   That humanity and the evil angelic
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.440]   is going to come together,
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.440]   co-mingle in rebellion against God.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.440]   Ephesians chapter three, verse 10.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.440]   "So that the manifold wisdom of God
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.440]   "might now be made known through the church."
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.440]   To who?
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.440]   "To the rulers and the authorities."
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.440]   Where?
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:12.440]   "In the heavenly places."
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.440]   See, this enemy,
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.440]   if we could kind of think about the reality of the enemy,
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.440]   if we go to the next slide.
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.440]   The enemy exists.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.440]   There's a reality of an enemy.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.440]   The enemy is strong
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:28.440]   and the enemy is incredibly cunning, deceiving.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.440]   But the reason why we need to look at all these passages
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.440]   is because we can't look at it
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.440]   like it's a past tense thing.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.440]   We have to remember that this very same enemy
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.440]   that we see in the Old Testament,
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.440]   the very same enemy that we see in the New Testament,
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.440]   the ancient serpent of old,
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:45.440]   is today prowling amongst us.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.440]   He is here and he is...
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.440]   Oh, thank you.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.440]   He is strong today.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:56.440]   He is cunning today as ever.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.440]   He hasn't waned in power and authority
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:02.440]   that God has described to him.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.440]   I wonder if it's grown,
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.440]   especially as the days have grown so evil.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.440]   You can, again, see quite a lot of fruit
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:17.440]   in today's society and culture.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.440]   He exists today.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.440]   He is strong today.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.440]   He is cunning today.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.440]   And you can't just think,
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.440]   you know, he's like way over there.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:32.440]   There's a reason why he says this to the church.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.440]   What does this mean?
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.440]   In our work, in our personal lives,
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:40.440]   what does this mean for us in our church?
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.440]   That if there's an actual enemy at work,
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.440]   what does it mean?
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.440]   What's he going to do?
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.440]   How would he take us down?
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.440]   How would he strategize?
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.440]   What does this mean for our world?
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.440]   The way we see what's going on in this world,
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.440]   do you think that the enemy is not involved?
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.440]   Of course he is.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.440]   It's not even just a speculation.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:07.440]   Of course he's involved.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.440]   All over the world,
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.440]   in governmental authorities,
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.440]   that's why they're called rulers and authorities.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:17.440]   They have some God-given level of power and dominion.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.440]   And so in Psalm 2, verse 1, it says,
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.440]   "Why are the nations in an uproar
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.440]   "and the peoples devising a vain thing?
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.440]   "The kings of the earth take their stand
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.440]   "and the rulers take counsel together
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.440]   "against the Lord and against his anointed."
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:33.440]   That was the reality of the enemy.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.440]   Which brings us to our second point,
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.440]   the fight against the enemy.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:44.440]   The fight against the enemy.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.440]   If I could read this passage again.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   "Finally, be strong in the Lord
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.440]   "and in the strength of his might.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.440]   "Put on the full armor of God
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.440]   "so that you will be able to stand firm
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.440]   "against the schemes of the devil.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.440]   "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.440]   "but against the rulers, powers,
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.440]   "world forces of this darkness,
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.440]   "against the spiritual forces of wickedness
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.440]   "and the heavenly places.
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:01.440]   "Therefore, take up the full armor of God
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.440]   "so that you will be able to resist in the evil day.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.440]   "And having done everything to stand firm."
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.440]   Three imperatives given here.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:10.440]   Be strong, put on, take up.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.440]   Those are the three imperatives
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.440]   that are found in this passage.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.440]   These are commands.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.440]   And so letter A, the command is to be strong.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:24.440]   The command is to be strong.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.440]   Even that idea of put on, take up is what?
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.440]   Is of the armor.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:29.440]   Put on the armor.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.440]   Take up the armor.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.440]   And armor is strong.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.440]   It's not weak.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.440]   It's not brittle.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   You wanna put on like weak, brittle cardboard armor?
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.440]   He's saying put it on
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.440]   because he wants you to be strong.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.440]   He wants us to be strong.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.440]   And it is a command.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.440]   It is not an optional thing.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.440]   By the way, put on and take up,
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.440]   it's called an heiress imperative.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.440]   Something, basically the idea of it
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.440]   is that it should never be taken off.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:59.360]   It was put on in the past and it stays on.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:07.360]   If you continue looking at this passage
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:08.360]   in verse 10 there,
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.360]   it says be strong in the Lord
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.360]   and in the strength.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.360]   And he says of his might.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.360]   It's needless repetition.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.360]   Be strong in the Lord
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.360]   and the strength of his might.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.360]   Trying to show the strength and power.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.360]   He's saying be strong.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.360]   The word strong is dunamai.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.360]   It's powerful.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.360]   It's packed.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.360]   It's forceful.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.360]   Verse 11 has a very interesting word.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.360]   It's the word able.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.360]   We would just skip right over it
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.360]   if we didn't do a proper study.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.360]   But it says in verse 11,
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   put on the full armor of God
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.360]   so that you will be able.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.360]   That has the exact same root as be strong.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.360]   Not so that you will just be able
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.360]   to stand firm.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.360]   It's that you will be strong
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.360]   to stand firm.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.360]   That you will have the strength
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.360]   to stand firm.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.360]   In verse 11 he uses the word resist.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.360]   To resist, it has that idea
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.360]   of being strong.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.360]   To go against.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.360]   To exert power against something.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.360]   Continuing in verse 11,
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.360]   he says stand firm.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.360]   It's the word histemi.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.360]   When used in the military sense,
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.360]   it means to hold a critical position
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.280]   while under attack.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.280]   It's to hold.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   Be strong.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:27.280]   That word is again used in verse 13.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.280]   By the way, the word resist
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.280]   is also another interesting word.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:34.280]   The word resist is anti-histemi.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.280]   So it's the same word
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.280]   as histemi, stand firm,
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.280]   except it has the word anti meaning
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.280]   stand firm against the one
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:43.280]   who it's standing against.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.280]   These are all strong words.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.280]   And there's some strength
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:49.280]   that is being called for.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.280]   Has anyone ever told you
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:54.280]   be strong?
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.280]   What was the setting?
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.280]   What was the context
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.280]   as to why someone would have
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:02.280]   to tell you to be strong?
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.280]   Because you feel the trembling
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.280]   at the foundation, right?
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.280]   Because you feel the temptation
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.280]   inside of a friend
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.280]   who is going to go after
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.280]   the wrong person romantically.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.280]   Who is going to do the wrong thing.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.280]   Make the wrong decisions
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.280]   in their lives.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.280]   Who is going to,
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.280]   you can see something
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.280]   shaking inside of them
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:23.280]   and so you say be strong.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   Don't slack and don't be weak.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.280]   A year ago I watched
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.280]   the Rocky movies again.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   Rocky movies.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.280]   I think maybe about half of us
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.280]   probably know it now.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.280]   But Rocky movies were great.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.280]   Those were my childhood movies.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.280]   I loved it.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.280]   My favorite ones were one and four.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.280]   It got me to thinking about this
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.280]   because in Rocky four
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.280]   there's this guy named Ivan Drago.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.200]   He's a Russian boxer.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.200]   He's roided up.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.200]   That means steroids.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.200]   He has steroids
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.200]   coursing through his body.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.200]   And then he's just
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.200]   the whole thing.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.200]   Half the movie is a montage
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.200]   of them like working out,
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.200]   getting strong,
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.200]   running on these treadmills,
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.200]   pulling things.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.200]   It's an incredible thing to watch.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.200]   You just get motivated
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.200]   watching it while you're
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.200]   just sitting on a couch
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.200]   eating chips.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.200]   So ridiculous.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   But you're watching them do this
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   and they're getting stronger
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.200]   and stronger and stronger.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.200]   Rocky's doing the same thing.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.120]   Except he's doing it
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.120]   the humble way.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.120]   So he's going about
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.120]   getting bigger and stronger.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.120]   And by the time
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.120]   they get to the ring
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.120]   you know that he's ready
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.120]   to engage in this battle.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.120]   It's all leading up
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.120]   to this climax
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.120]   where Rocky gets into the ring.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.120]   He takes off that robe
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.120]   and you're just like
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.120]   wow, he is strong.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.120]   And in the middle
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.120]   of this movie
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.120]   as they're boxing
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   I remember this.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.120]   This is why
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.120]   I'm bringing this image.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.120]   Ivan Drago sits down
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.120]   at the corner
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.120]   and he goes
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.120]   this man is like iron.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.120]   I'm like yeah,
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.120]   he's like iron.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.120]   Didn't you see
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.120]   what he was doing?
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.120]   He was waking up
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.120]   at the crack of dawn.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.120]   He was eating things
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.120]   that were--
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.120]   they weren't showing him eating
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:54.120]   but I'm sure
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:55.120]   he was eating things
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.120]   that were like
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.120]   good for his body.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.120]   He wasn't sitting there
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.120]   like stuffing himself
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.120]   with carbs and sugar
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.120]   and you know
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.120]   whatever he wanted.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.120]   He wasn't like
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.120]   I'll do it tomorrow.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.120]   He was--
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.120]   this was just discipline.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:12.120]   This was a strong man.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.120]   So strong
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.120]   that this man
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.120]   basically like just
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.120]   towers over Rocky
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:21.120]   would be taken down.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.120]   There was a strength
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.120]   that came not just
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.120]   with his body
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.120]   but with his mind.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.120]   And so I bring up
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.120]   this story.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.120]   I bring up
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.120]   this example
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.120]   to just kind of
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.120]   bring it back
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.120]   to where we are.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.120]   Are we strong?
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.120]   Like what does it mean
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.120]   when you come across
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.120]   an imperative
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.120]   from God?
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.120]   Where God commands us
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.120]   be strong.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.120]   And it's almost
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.120]   like we're so blind
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.120]   that he needs to say
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.120]   things like be strong
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.120]   in the strength
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.120]   of his might,
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.120]   resist, stand firm,
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.120]   stand firm, be strong.
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.120]   Put on the armor,
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.120]   get ready,
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.120]   be strong.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.120]   It's--
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.120]   what does that mean?
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.120]   If you came across
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.120]   this passage
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:07.120]   just like I have
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.120]   and I looked at it
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.120]   does it rebuke you
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:13.120]   just like it did to me?
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.040]   You go like oh yeah
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.040]   I'm supposed to be strong
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.040]   there's an enemy
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.040]   move on.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.040]   Is that what happens?
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:23.040]   What is the application?
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.040]   The enemy is prowling
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.040]   to take down
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.040]   not only the individual
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.040]   but the church.
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.040]   He is prowling
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.040]   all over the planet
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:38.040]   scheming, conniving.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.040]   The rulers,
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.040]   the authorities
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.040]   of this age
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.040]   given some level
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.040]   of power and dominion
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:50.040]   and rule.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.040]   What are we?
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.040]   Are we Christian
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:57.040]   couch potatoes?
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.040]   Looking for the next
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:04.040]   movie to come out?
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.040]   I was trying
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.040]   not to say it
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.040]   because it rebukes me
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.040]   but like you know
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:11.040]   so much Dodgers right now.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.040]   Pastor Peter he brings
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.040]   it up because of me
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.040]   I think.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.040]   He brings up
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.040]   that example
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.040]   and he stares straight
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:22.040]   at me in the sermon.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.040]   You know our bodies
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.040]   might be physically strong.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.040]   We live in an age
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.040]   like people are watching
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.040]   Physical 100
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.040]   and things like that.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.040]   We live in an age
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.040]   where everyone's
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.040]   trying to be strong
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.040]   and like they're
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.040]   going to the gym
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.040]   and we're running
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.040]   we have people
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.040]   we have a running club
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.040]   here in Birmingham
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.040]   did you know that?
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.040]   They're crazy
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.040]   they're absolutely insane
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:41.960]   they run 50 miles
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:42.960]   and laugh afterwards
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   you know it's crazy.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:48.960]   Our muscles
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:49.960]   physically can be strong
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   we can grow
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:51.960]   in strength
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.960]   like with our cardio
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.960]   and we can be
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.960]   so spiritually weak.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:56.960]   We could be so disciplined
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.960]   about what we put
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.960]   into our bodies
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:51:59.960]   about when we wake up
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:00.960]   so that we can go
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:01.960]   and make our bodies strong
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:02.960]   and we could be
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.960]   spiritually weak.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.960]   The enemy would laugh.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:08.960]   The enemy salivates
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:13.960]   at things like that.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:14.960]   We could be
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:15.960]   mentally strong
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:16.960]   intellectually
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:17.960]   putting more
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:18.960]   and more into our heads
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:22.960]   growing in every way
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:23.960]   mentally
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.960]   but be spiritually weak.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:27.960]   This is the call
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:31.960]   to be spiritually strong.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.960]   Everything else
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.960]   has some benefit
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.960]   this is what we need
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:36.960]   for godliness
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.960]   to stand in a war
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:40.960]   to understand what it means
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.960]   not to fall
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:45.960]   to civilian affairs.
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:46.960]   More on this in a moment.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:47.960]   Letter B
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:48.960]   the command is not just
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:49.960]   to be strong
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:53.960]   but to be strong in god.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.960]   What is strength biblically?
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.960]   When we tell someone
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:58.960]   to be strong
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:52:59.960]   is it just like
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:00.960]   be strong
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.960]   and like you know
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:02.960]   you muster up willpower?
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.960]   What does it mean
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.960]   to be strong biblically?
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:05.960]   Well it says
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:06.960]   for when I am weak
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.960]   then I am strong
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.960]   and that drives me crazy.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:10.960]   This passage drives me
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:11.960]   up the wall
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:12.960]   because he says
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:13.960]   when I am weak
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:14.960]   then I am strong
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:15.960]   so what are you
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:16.960]   asking me to do?
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:17.960]   So am I supposed
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.960]   to be weak
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.960]   or am I supposed
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:24.960]   to be strong?
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.960]   But if you're a Christian
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:26.960]   you know exactly
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.960]   what this is talking about
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.960]   because if you're a Christian
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.960]   you know
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.960]   you have experienced
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.960]   this first hand
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:35.960]   that it is at our
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:36.960]   weakest points
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:37.960]   that we know
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:38.960]   the strength of God
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.960]   coursing through us.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:41.960]   That those are the times
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:42.960]   when we turn to God
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.960]   the most.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.960]   That those are the times
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:46.960]   where we feel
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.960]   so weak in our flesh
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.960]   and yet we feel
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:50.960]   so strengthened
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.960]   because those are the times
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.960]   in my weakness of flesh
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.960]   that my strength
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:57.960]   comes from the Lord.
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.960]   In verse 11
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:00.960]   chapter 6 verse 11
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:01.960]   he says
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.960]   in the Lord.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:08.960]   Did you know
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.960]   that's a passive imperative?
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:10.960]   It's passive.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:11.960]   It means
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.960]   be strengthened.
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:16.960]   It means
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:17.960]   you have the responsibility
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:18.960]   but he needs
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:19.960]   to do the work.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.960]   That's what it says there.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:22.960]   He says
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:23.960]   be strong
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.960]   in the Lord.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:26.960]   In verse 11
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.960]   he says
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:28.960]   in the strength
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.960]   of his might
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.960]   not my might.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:33.960]   In the strength
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:34.960]   of his might
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:35.960]   in verse 12
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:36.960]   he talks about this armor
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:37.960]   as not just being
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:38.960]   some armor that the Bible
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:39.960]   just talks about.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:40.960]   It's the armor
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:44.960]   of God.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:45.960]   To find strength
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:46.960]   in the Lord
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:47.960]   and the strength
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.960]   that he can provide.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:51.960]   In Philippians 2.12
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.960]   it says
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:53.960]   so then my beloved
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:54.960]   just as you have always obeyed
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:55.960]   now as in my presence only
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:56.960]   but much more in my absence
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.960]   work out your salvation
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:54:59.960]   with fear and trembling.
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.960]   Here's our responsibility.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:01.960]   And then in verse 13
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:02.960]   he turns it around
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.960]   and he says
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:04.960]   for it is God
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:05.960]   who is at work in you
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:06.960]   both to will and to work
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.960]   for his own good pleasure.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:09.960]   It's his will at work.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.960]   It is his work at work.
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:12.960]   But he says
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.960]   you work it out.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:16.960]   Why?
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:17.960]   Because this is
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.960]   the essence of faith.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:25.960]   Faith is a place of surrender.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:26.960]   That it causes us to cling
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.960]   to the one who can.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:29.960]   And he's talking about this.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:33.960]   And look at Joshua chapter 23 verse 5.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:34.960]   It's a little bit of a longer text
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.960]   but I think it's good.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.960]   The Lord your God
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.960]   he will thrust them out before you
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.960]   and drive them from before you
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.960]   and you will possess their land
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:44.960]   just as the Lord your God
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:45.960]   promised you.
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:46.960]   And I want to remind you
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:47.960]   that in the Old Testament
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:48.960]   in the narrative
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.960]   before the kings
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.960]   the driving out of people
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:53.960]   had a lot to do yes
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:54.960]   with the Canaanites
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:55.960]   and the people
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:56.960]   and things like that
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:57.960]   but because of the gods
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:58.960]   that they worshiped
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:55:59.960]   he always links
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:00.960]   these two things together.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:01.960]   It's not just the people
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:02.960]   because there are people
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:03.960]   who are sinful.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.960]   It's because there is evil reigning
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:06.960]   and he is saying
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.960]   drive them out.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.960]   And so he says this.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.960]   He says you will possess their land
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:11.960]   just as the Lord your God
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:12.960]   promised you.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:13.960]   That's great.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:14.960]   Verse 5 is great
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:15.960]   because all it does
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:16.960]   is gives you a promise
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.960]   and that goes
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:18.960]   I could kick back.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:19.960]   I could just receive
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:20.960]   the promise now.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:22.960]   And then he says verse 6
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.960]   be very firm.
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.960]   He says be very firm then
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.960]   to keep and do
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:30.960]   all that is written
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:31.960]   in the book of the law of Moses
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:32.960]   so that you may not turn aside
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:33.960]   from it to the left
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:34.960]   from the right hand
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:35.960]   or to the left
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.960]   so that you will not associate
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:38.960]   with these nations
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.960]   these which remain among you
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:41.960]   or mention the name
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:42.960]   of their gods
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:43.960]   or make anyone swear by them
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:44.960]   or serve them
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:45.960]   or bow down to them
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:46.960]   but you are to cling
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:49.960]   to the Lord your God
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.960]   as you have done to this day.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:53.960]   We are weak people.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:56.960]   It's not like we have to become weak.
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:57.960]   We are weak people.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.960]   And so we have a tendency
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.960]   as weak people
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.960]   who are created to worship
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.960]   to go after things of strength
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.960]   because we don't have ability.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:07.960]   We will cling to those
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.960]   who proclaim to have ability.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:10.960]   And so we'll go after the ones
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.960]   who are going to be able
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.960]   to give me what I want and need.
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:14.960]   And so we will go to idols
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.960]   and say if this gives me security
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.960]   then I will surrender to this
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.960]   and I will give my life
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   to this thing.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.960]   If it is to the pleasures
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:23.960]   of the world
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:24.960]   then I will give myself
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:25.960]   to these things
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:26.960]   and we weaken
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:27.960]   and we weaken
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:28.960]   and we weaken
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.960]   as we continue to live a life
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:31.960]   that looks just like everybody else
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:35.960]   in this world.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:36.960]   But that is not who we are
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.960]   as Christians.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.960]   He says you are to cling
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:42.960]   to the Lord your God.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.960]   You are weak.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.960]   Be strong in your clinging.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:47.960]   Strongly cling.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:48.960]   In your faith
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:49.960]   you have nothing to offer
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:50.960]   so cling with everything
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.960]   that you have
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:52.960]   to the one
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.960]   who can do it for you.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:55.960]   Verse nine,
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.960]   "For the Lord has driven out
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:58.960]   "great and strong nations
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.960]   "from before you
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:00.960]   "and as for you
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:01.960]   "no man has stood
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:03.960]   "before you to this day.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:04.960]   "One of your men
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.960]   "puts to flight a thousand.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:07.960]   "For the Lord your God
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:08.960]   "is he who fights for you
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:10.960]   "just as he promised you.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:11.960]   "So take diligent heed
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:12.960]   "to yourselves
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.960]   "to love the Lord your God."
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.960]   See strength against the enemy
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:18.960]   and his schemes comes
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.960]   not as you just get ready
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:20.960]   to fight against the enemy
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.960]   but when you cling to the Lord
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:23.960]   as you see the enemy
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:24.960]   for who he is.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.960]   He is strong.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:28.960]   Let's not get that weird thing
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:29.960]   in our heads
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:30.960]   where we say we have
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:31.960]   the name of Jesus
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:32.960]   and so we just pronounce
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:33.960]   the name of Jesus
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.960]   and we could bind.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.960]   It's too elementary.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   That is too naive.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:39.960]   The Bible describes the enemy
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:42.960]   as having great strength.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:46.960]   Great power.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:47.960]   And so you cannot use
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:48.960]   the name of Jesus in vain.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:49.960]   Say in the name of Jesus
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:50.960]   and whatever it is
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:54.960]   we have to cling to Jesus.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.960]   Jesus is the one who drives.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:01.960]   When we come to difficulties in life
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:02.960]   it's not all about
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:03.960]   just receiving counsel
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:04.960]   and executing it
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.960]   that these are the things
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:06.960]   that I need to do.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:07.960]   It's about yielding.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.960]   It's about surrendering.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:10.960]   Sometimes it's about
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.960]   just straight up desperation.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.960]   It's about recognizing
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:15.960]   our own weaknesses
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:16.960]   and blindness
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.960]   and biases, sins.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.960]   You cannot do this on your own.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.960]   You cannot fight
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.960]   with your own strength.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:26.960]   You cannot give
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:27.960]   that kind of counsel either.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:28.960]   Like, oh, you're struggling with this?
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.960]   Well, this is what I did.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:31.960]   You go and do that.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:32.960]   So they go, oh, I gotta do this,
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:33.960]   this and this and this.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:34.960]   Then you are telling
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:35.960]   a young man to go
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:41.960]   and fight with his own willpower.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.960]   No, the fight is to cling to God
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:45.960]   and all of these things
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.960]   to point to Him
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:48.960]   because He alone
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.960]   can give us strength.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:53.960]   When He tells us to be strong
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.960]   it means to cling.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.960]   It means to surrender.
[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:58.960]   We come before Him in prayer
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.960]   asking for strength.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.960]   Don't ask Him for strength
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.960]   to change
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.960]   if you are not willing
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.960]   to yield and to surrender
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.960]   and to change.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.960]   Philippians 4.13 says,
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:12.960]   I can do all things through Christ
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.960]   who strengthens me.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.960]   This brings us to letter C.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.960]   The command is to be strong in God
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.960]   so that we might stand firm.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.960]   There's a so that here.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960]   There's a purpose.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   It's not just a strong to be strong.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.960]   It's not just be strong in the Lord
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.960]   so that you can be strong in the Lord.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.960]   It's like, great.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.960]   No, there is a purpose to it.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.960]   There is something
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.960]   we are trying to accomplish
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.960]   but because there is a war
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.960]   it's to accomplish this
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:40.960]   so that we might stand firm.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.960]   If we do not stay strong in God
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.960]   we will not stand firm.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.960]   If we are not walking with God
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:48.960]   we cannot stand firm.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.960]   If we are just trying to live
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:51.960]   a Christian religious life
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:55.960]   you cannot stand firm.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.960]   In verse 11 it says,
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.960]   so that you will stand firm.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.960]   In verse 13,
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.960]   so that you will be able to resist.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.960]   There's a resistance of standing firm.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.960]   It's a current of water flowing down
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:09.960]   and you're fighting against it.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.960]   It's a gale of wind
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:12.960]   that is going against you
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.960]   and you are putting every exerted effort
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.960]   to fight against the pressure
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:17.960]   that is coming this way.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.960]   He says, so that you might stand firm.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:21.960]   It's not just standing still.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.960]   It's moving forward.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:24.960]   There is movement.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.960]   There is actual direction.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:26.960]   There's a force direction.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.960]   If you're a math, physics person
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:30.960]   there's an arrow, a force arrow
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:37.960]   that is going against this.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.960]   So is this happening in our lives?
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.960]   Are we heeding God's command to be strong
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.960]   so that we might stand firm?
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.960]   Or are we looking for comfort?
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.960]   Are we looking for security?
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:55.960]   Are we living for this age?
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.960]   Have our minds and hearts
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:03.960]   and our bodies grown weak?
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.960]   And we've used this day and age.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.960]   We've used Orange County.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:08.960]   We've used America.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.960]   We've used what we have around us
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.960]   to justify.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.960]   It's very challenging to me.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.960]   We have to keep reminding each other of this.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.960]   I want to remind you that it says
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.960]   so that we might stand firm.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.960]   We have to stand firm.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.960]   This is not just God to you.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.960]   We have to say as a church
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:38.960]   that we amen this concept.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.960]   And so we will not allow each other
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.960]   to be drifting into these things.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.960]   We stand firm together
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.960]   against the schemes of the enemy.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:50.960]   Letter D.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.960]   The command is to be strong in God
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.960]   so that we might stand firm
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.960]   against the enemy.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.960]   That's what it says in verse 11.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.960]   The schemes of the enemy.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.960]   The word schemes, methodia
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.960]   is where we get our word method.
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.960]   Crafty scheming with the intent to deceive.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.960]   Looking to pounce.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:06.960]   Looking for an opportunity.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.960]   Did I use a hunting image yet?
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.960]   Was that the last?
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.960]   Did I say anything about hunting?
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.960]   I didn't, okay.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.960]   So there was a time
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.960]   when I watched videos of hunters.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.960]   I don't know why.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.960]   They were hunting deer.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.960]   And it was just kind of like fascinating to me.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.960]   I would never do it
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.960]   because they have to just
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.960]   like lay down in the brush for hours
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.960]   and it's agonizingly boring to me.
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.960]   Watching them was fun.
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.960]   And so they're just in the brush
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:35.960]   and they have the gun trained
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.960]   and looking to see.
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960]   It's like a salt lake.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.960]   There's like deers that would come through
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:40.960]   and things like that.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.960]   And so they have the scope there
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.960]   and just waiting and waiting and waiting.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.960]   They don't even take their eyes off
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.960]   and finally a deer comes.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.960]   It's a very fascinating battle.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.960]   There's trees
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:50.960]   and so there are moments
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.960]   when that scope is on that deer
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:53.960]   but the tree is kind of in the way
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.960]   but I'm like but you can get its butt right there.
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:56.960]   It's like right there.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.960]   You can just kind of hit that end.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.960]   But he doesn't.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:00.960]   He just waits.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.960]   Sits there and waits.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.960]   There's a moment
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:04.960]   where he kind of shifts his weight
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.960]   and goes and then the deer goes like this
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:07.960]   and looks up.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.960]   He's just kind of looking around like a deer.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.960]   And as he's doing that
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:13.960]   you would think like
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.960]   this is going to run away.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.960]   Sometimes I'm rooting for the deer.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.960]   Run.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:17.960]   It's like Bambi.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.960]   Run.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.960]   And then sometimes you're rooting for the hunter.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.960]   It's just a weird confusing thing.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.960]   So as this is happening
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:26.960]   they play this game
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.960]   where it's like he looks around
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:32.960]   and then the hunter just sits there quietly.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.960]   And the deer's like okay.
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:35.960]   Maybe I just heard something.
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.960]   I don't know.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:37.960]   Just goes back to his life
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.960]   and he goes and he starts to eat his grass
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.960]   or whatever it is
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.960]   and then again he senses something.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:44.960]   He looks up and they do this
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.960]   and finally he kind of comes out into the clearing
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.960]   and then bam.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.960]   The hunter shoots.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:53.960]   I took a moment to kind of paint that picture
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.960]   because when it says
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.960]   that there are schemes of the enemy
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.960]   there's methodea.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.960]   It's crafty scheming.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:00.960]   It's plotting.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.960]   It's desiring to pounce.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.960]   And it's not when you expect it.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:05.960]   It's not when someone is on guard.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.960]   It's when they are least guarded
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:12.960]   that the enemy is waiting for that in our lives.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.960]   And you know
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.960]   if you're a Christian
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.960]   you have sensed this.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:17.960]   You have fought this before
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.960]   that sometimes it's when we are the most guarded
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.960]   or least guarded.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.960]   It's when we are feeling
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.960]   like the danger has passed.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.960]   It's after a retreat.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.960]   It's after some period of time in life
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.960]   where you feel like you've grown
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:36.960]   that the enemy comes and pounces.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.960]   And it's not pounced like a kitty
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.960]   pounces cutely on a ball.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.960]   This is a roaring lion
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:48.960]   who will tear you apart.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.960]   How can we not stand engaged?
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.960]   Stand strong.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.960]   We have to remember
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.960]   that there's a war.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.960]   If you don't see this
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.960]   then we're just going to relax and let go.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.960]   We're going to shrug.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960]   We're not going to be equipped
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.960]   with the right mentality
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.960]   and sight and world view
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.960]   of an enemy that is strong.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.960]   Remember that this enemy
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.960]   is scheming against us.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.960]   There's many ways that he can scheme.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.960]   He can say you fight your sin on your own.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.960]   That there are methods that you can take.
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.960]   Boundaries that you can put up.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.960]   That you can do this work.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.960]   And all the while in the name
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.960]   of doing what is right before God
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:30.960]   we have turned our backs on God
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:34.960]   forgetting that he himself is our strength.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.960]   I'm good.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.960]   Christ is our strength.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.960]   James 4.7 says submit therefore to God.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:47.960]   Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.960]   This is a present continuous.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.960]   Today, today, today.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.960]   Tomorrow when you wake up
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:54.960]   you say today, right?
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:55.960]   It's today.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:56.960]   Then today.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:57.960]   It's every single day.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.960]   It's saying resist.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.960]   I say this because we have heard of men fall.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:06.960]   Pastors who fall all over the place.
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.960]   And we wonder.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:09.960]   The question that comes to my mind
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:10.960]   same as I'm sure with yours.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.960]   How do we get to that place?
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.960]   How does a man get to that place?
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:16.960]   You know what?
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.960]   It's a lot less confusing.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:26.960]   It's a lot less mysterious to me than I realize.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.960]   Because when we put down our guard.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.960]   When we forget what's going on.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.960]   You will find a man who is not standing firm.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.960]   As soon as we become a Christian.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.960]   We are called to strive to enter the rest of Christ.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.960]   Because until we go to glory.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:48.960]   We are going to be fighting in a battle.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.960]   We have to keep fighting.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.960]   Does that sound exhausting?
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.960]   Does this passage exhaust us?
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:00.960]   But the scriptures simply paint a reality.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.960]   There's no other way to look at this.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.960]   Otherwise we're just going to eat our chips
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.960]   and watch the Dodger game.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.960]   It's just going to happen.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.960]   We wonder how people get to these places.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.960]   No.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:21.960]   Some of us are in these places.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.960]   There is no other option.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:28.960]   We have to stand strong.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.960]   Max Turner says in his new Bible commentary.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960]   Note too that Paul.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.960]   I'm sorry it's long.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.960]   I like long quotes.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.960]   Note too that Paul has a particular sort of battle in mind.
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.960]   One to hold a strong position.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:42.960]   His exhortation does not prepare soldiers to make a quick moving attack.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.960]   And the Roman soldiers key attack weapons.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:45.960]   The twin javelins are missing.
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:46.960]   But to take stand.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.960]   To stand your ground and to stand firm.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.960]   They hold the crown of the hill as it were.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.960]   And the enemy must weary itself in constant uphill attack.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.960]   The strong position Paul has in mind.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.960]   Will be clear to the reader.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.960]   It is our union with Christ.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960]   The head over all things.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.960]   Far above all principalities and powers.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.960]   And the resurrection power of God at work in us.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.960]   Even the armor and weapons turn out to be a mixture of God's very own.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.960]   With those of his Messiah.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.960]   And yet Paul shows no triumphalism here.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.960]   Listen to that.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.960]   He shows no triumphalism here.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:18.960]   The decisive victory won by Christ lies in the past.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.960]   And the very fact that believers now fight on Christ's side.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.960]   Is clear testimony to that.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.960]   But complete victory still lies in the future.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.960]   In the meantime it is a day of evil.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.960]   That appears to dominate the scene.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.960]   And by the way that's what it says previously in Ephesians chapter 5.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:39.960]   Make good use of your time for the day is evil.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.960]   This quote is telling us.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.960]   That the strength that we have is found in Christ.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.960]   The victory is in Christ.
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:48.960]   That then if we are not clinging to him.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.960]   Then what's going to happen to us?
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.960]   We will fall.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.960]   As believers there is forgiveness.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:03.960]   There is discipline.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.960]   But if Christ is not our strength.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.960]   Then that's going to happen.
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.960]   It's going to happen in a moment of indiscretion.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.960]   It's going to happen when your patience is done.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.960]   After your kids have been driving you crazy sometimes.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:20.960]   You've been patient.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.960]   You've been patient.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.960]   You've been patient.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:23.960]   Trying to be godly.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.960]   Trying to be godly.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960]   Trying to be godly.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960]   And then boom.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:33.960]   All of that effort turned into a force of anger.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.960]   The more patient you were the more angry you can get.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:43.960]   When you look at the things of this world and all that it might give to us.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.960]   We have to stand firm.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.960]   We have to fight at every moment.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.960]   It's not a fighting that happens just at that moment of engagement.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.960]   It's a fighting that happens.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.960]   It's a preparatory fighting that is going on.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.960]   So that in the moment of battle we are ready.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:06.960]   Rocky did not wake up and go look at my abs.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:11.960]   It took him months of preparation to fight and get there.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.960]   To resist.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.960]   1 Thessalonians chapter 3 verse 5 it says,
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.960]   "For this reason when I could endure it no longer I also sent to find out about your faith.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.960]   For fear that the tempter might have tempted you and our labor would be in vain."
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.960]   That there is a very present danger.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.960]   That the tempter might tempt us and the work done is in vain.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.960]   And it says in Revelation 2 verse 24,
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.960]   "But I say to you the rest who are in Thyatira who do not hold this teaching,
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.960]   who have not known the deep things of,"
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.960]   very specifically he's talking about Satan as they call them,
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.960]   "I place no other burden on you.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:50.960]   Nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come."
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.960]   Hold fast.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.960]   Cling tooth and nail.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.960]   Glue yourself.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.960]   "He who overcomes and he who keeps my deeds until the end."
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:05.960]   And he continues in this word to Thyatira.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.960]   We have to engage in this war.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.960]   We are not in peace time.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.960]   Having peace in Christ.
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.960]   Having peace in God.
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:19.960]   Does not mean we are living in peace time right now.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.960]   We are in war.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:28.960]   Maybe we aren't interested in the armor because we're not engaged in battle.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:31.960]   It's a command to take up the full armor of God.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.960]   Finally then our application.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.960]   We can skip the quote there to go to letter A.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.960]   So here's our first application.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.960]   We must recognize our weakness.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.960]   You cannot do this on your own.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.960]   You need God.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.960]   How much more elementary can we get?
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.960]   You cannot do this on your own.
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.960]   You need God.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.960]   We can't stand against the enemy's schemes on our own.
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:56.960]   We need God.
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:01.960]   We need him telling us his truth through his spirit.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:04.960]   We have to understand and see this reality.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   We are so weak.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:12.960]   In 1 Corinthians 10, 12 it says let the one who thinks he stands take heed lest he falls.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.960]   We have to recognize our weakness.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.960]   Secondly, we must be dependent then.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.960]   And we think that if we recognize our weakness then we would be dependent.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.960]   But many times we don't link it.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.960]   We have to then be dependent on God.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.960]   We have to turn our eyes to God.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:29.960]   Or in our weakness we will turn our eyes to things.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.960]   To people.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.960]   We have to depend on God.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:35.960]   We have to cling to God every day.
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:38.960]   Not be satisfied with the fact that I was clinging to him yesterday.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.960]   It has to be today.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.960]   Not be satisfied that I'm clinging to him today.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.960]   Getting ready to cling to him tomorrow and the next day until he comes back.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:51.960]   That's part of the thing that magnetizes us to the return of Christ.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.960]   Communion is helpful for that.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:59.960]   Until the day he returns we will continue to live in remembrance together.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.960]   To cling to him.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.960]   And again for those of us who feel like this is exhausting.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.960]   There was a time when I saw this passage that we look at as exhausting.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.960]   And then I don't think so anymore.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:17.960]   Because what I realize is if this call to fight and to depend on God is not exhausting.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.960]   When the whole application then is to cling to Christ.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.960]   Because that's the very thing that I want to do.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.960]   So if somebody said do this, do that.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.960]   Obey this, obey that.
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.960]   Kind of be dependent.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.960]   But if it's like love Christ.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.960]   Oh, okay.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:44.960]   It just boils it all down to this very, very basic faith.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:46.960]   Because I love Christ.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:47.960]   That's not hard.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:50.960]   If somebody comes and commands me to love my wife.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.960]   Who do you think you are commanding me to love my wife?
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:54.960]   It is.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.960]   It just exists.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.960]   I do love my wife.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.960]   Thirdly, we must be disciplined.
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.960]   That means that everything we do in our disciplines is to cling.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.960]   It's to be dependent.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:12.960]   You can see how quickly we can use our disciplines to use our own strength, right?
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.960]   That's what we quickly run to that.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.960]   And so we just check things off.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:21.960]   And we're like, oh, maybe but because I did there's an extra dose of blessing that God will launch at us from afar.
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.960]   No, reading the word is because we're clinging to God.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.960]   Praying is because we're clinging to God.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.960]   Meditating is because we're clinging.
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:31.960]   Memorizing is because we're clinging.
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:36.960]   We're reading books because we're clinging to Christ.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:44.960]   The time we spend with each other playing basketball, volleyball, watching movies together, to cling to Christ.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:46.960]   Everything that we do is to cling to Christ.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:52.960]   So even in these disciplines, we can't allow them to take control of us where we think that it is our strength moving us forward.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.960]   Our disciplines are meant to bring us to Christ where we find our actual strength.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:01.960]   Letter D, finally, we must remember the victory.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:07.960]   This isn't just a thing that we tag on at the end like, oh, yeah, Jesus won it all.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:09.960]   This is the thing that glues everything together.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.960]   Remember that the victory is promised.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.960]   When he says it is finished, it means that it's finished.
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.960]   We're in a waiting period.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:16.960]   Jesus is coming back.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.960]   We will return to him.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.960]   He has already secured the victory.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.960]   And so stand strong.
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:28.960]   Stand strong in whatever it is that you've been doing in your life lately.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.960]   Ask yourself, what have I been standing strong in?
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:36.960]   And let's move that to make sure that we're saying I'm standing firm in Christ.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.960]   Let's pray.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:44.960]   Heavenly Father, we pray, Lord, for strength that can only come from you.
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:49.960]   And I pray, God, that we wouldn't be asking you for strength apart from you.
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:54.960]   But, Lord, that in our asking for strength, we are simply asking for you.
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.960]   God, we need you.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.960]   We are in desperate need for you.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:05.960]   And, Father, we need that to flow to the top of our fellowship, our church.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:08.960]   God, it has to be all about you.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.960]   Otherwise, our church is going to fall.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.960]   So, Father, I pray for our private lives.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.960]   I pray for our corporate fellowship.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:24.960]   God, I pray for all the churches that reside in this world.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:31.960]   God, that we would stand strong, clinging to Christ, engaging in battle, putting on the armor.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:37.960]   Father, recognizing that this all can only be done with a God who has already promised and secured victory.
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.960]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:47.960]   Let us stand together for the closing song.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:18.960]   Christ in me is to live, to die is to gain.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:31.960]   Christ in me is to live, to die is to gain.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:34.960]   Christ in me.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:49.960]   Christ in me is to live, to die is to gain.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:19:03.960]   Christ in me is to live, to die is to gain.
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:18.960]   He is my king. He is my song. He is my life. He is my joy.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:36.960]   He is my strength. He is my soul. He is my peace. He is my Lord.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.960]   Christ in me.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:20:06.960]   Christ in me is to live, to die is to gain.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:19.960]   Christ in me is to live, to die is to gain.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.960]   One last time.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:36.960]   Christ in me is to live, to die is to gain.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:51.960]   Christ in me is to live, to die is to gain.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:21:06.960]   He is my king. He is my song. He is my life. He is my joy.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:23.960]   He is my strength. He is my soul. He is my peace. He is my Lord.
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:40.960]   Christ in me is to live, to die is to gain.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:45.960]   May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God our Father,
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:48.960]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us all
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:51.960]   to empower us to live in such an aware manner,
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.960]   both for now and forevermore. Amen.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:00.960]   God sent His Son.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.960]   They called Him Jesus.
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:15.960]   He came to love, heal, and forgive.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:25.960]   He lived and died to buy my pardon.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:35.960]   An empty grave is there to be my Savior then.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:45.960]   Because He lived, I can face tomorrow.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:55.960]   Because He lived, all fear is gone.
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:05.960]   Because I know He holds the future.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:13.960]   And life is worth the living just because He lived.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.960]   He is worthy.
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:23.960]   Holy, holy is the Word made flesh.
