[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.480]   Well, the study through 1 Peter I think has both been super good in terms of its depth,
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.600]   but part of it again has been kind of tough.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.560]   And I think part of that is because although we hit many sections where the scriptures
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.640]   in 1 Peter was giving us specific commands, there was a lot about 1 Peter that actually
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.040]   was reiterating in repetitive fashion, was trying to give exhortation not on the way
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.040]   of like, "I need you to do this specifically," but on the way of thinking and having an attitude
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.000]   that's more godly.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.880]   Especially having a worldview, a perspective on life, a perspective on God, a perspective
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.800]   on who we are, a perspective, etc., etc., about how we're supposed to interpret the
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.720]   world as we perceive it, especially because, again, the people that he's talking to, his
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.640]   audience are people who's going through a whirlwind of difficulty, especially intense
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.860]   persecution, right?
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.920]   So by way of quick review, I want to go through certain perspectives that Apostle Peter challenged
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.720]   the Christians to have in order to have an appropriate attitude, that as they go through
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.320]   this season, these hurdles over their lives, that come out through it, not just simply,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.640]   "Oh my gosh, we just need to pound out and like bear through this," but rather actually
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.520]   thriving in Christ.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.680]   So the first thing, we studied in chapters 1 and into chapter 2, that there was a great
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.920]   calling and salvation.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.360]   So this is for your fill in the blanks right here.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.360]   That there was an incredible calling and salvation.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.120]   Remember he started off by saying, "You who are scattered," and gave this long list of
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.160]   areas that they've been spread out to in the diaspora, so to speak, and he says, "But you've
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.360]   been called and chosen."
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.920]   And he reminds them that this salvation that they've been given, it wasn't a spur of the
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.720]   moment, but it was planned long ago, and even angels and prophets would look intently into
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.960]   this salvation that they have.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.440]   And from that flows the expectation.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.880]   So there was a great calling and salvation and a great expectation.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.880]   And God gave them many expectations in terms of who they are to be in their character,
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.680]   in their love, in their hunger for the Word, and et cetera, et cetera, right?
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.340]   Number two, then after giving that kind of preface, he says, "God is doing a great work
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.800]   in you," and so he challenges them, "You need to be who you are, who God has made you to
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   be."
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   So it's be who you are, okay?
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.520]   Be who you are.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.160]   And that's that section where he starts to say, "And God is purposing to do this and
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.480]   as you're coming to the cornerstone," he says, "you are, as it were, living stones being
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.160]   built up into a spiritual house.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160]   You're a powerhouse of God," right?
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.560]   He says, "You are a holy nation.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.360]   You're a royal priesthood.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.440]   You're God's own possession.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.600]   And so you have an incredible purpose to offer spiritual sacrifices to God.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.240]   You have a purpose to give God glory and proclaim His excellencies," and he goes on about, "You
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.320]   need to be who you are, who God has made you to be," right?
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.760]   And that's a perspective that we have to have.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.840]   What's more, he went on to a lengthy section where he started to describe different categories
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840]   of people.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.320]   This is number three, starting from chapter two, verse 13, he describes to them what is
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.560]   real strength found in submission, found in submission, okay?
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.320]   So there's your word.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.600]   And he says, "So every single one of you submit to governing authorities, whether governors,"
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.320]   and then he talks about the workers or even slaves, and he says, "Even to those masters
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.280]   who seem unfair, unjust, submit."
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.640]   And then he says, "To the wives, even if your husband is disobedient to the word, learn
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   to submit."
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:06.360]   And he gives the example of Christ saying, "Look what Christ has done, voluntarily surrendering.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.800]   This is real strength."
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.960]   And then lastly, starting from the end of chapter three into chapter four at the tail
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.480]   end of it, he basically says, "Glorify God since the end is near."
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.440]   He puts it in other terms by saying, like, "Just don't suffer for being silly.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.440]   Don't suffer for your own sins."
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.280]   He says, "If you're going to suffer, suffer for the glory of God.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.480]   Suffer for doing what's right.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.160]   Suffer for what He's pleased by," right?
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.840]   Now in all of this, I'm kind of setting the pace that, so all of this, what Apostle Peter
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.600]   has been doing, as I summarize the whole book for us right now, is he's been giving us
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.200]   a perspective of mind.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.040]   Where yes, maybe some people are just looking for a way out.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.960]   Maybe they're just looking for just a small glimmer of hope from Apostle Peter, but he
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.080]   says, "No, I'm going to challenge you to go above and beyond what you thought was natural
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.040]   to you by giving you a big perspective of what God is doing in you."
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.120]   And challenging you to have a perspective, like, "We need to live up to this calling."
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.720]   And what's more, God has given us an immense purpose, even through what's really confusing,
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.800]   which is our persecution and our suffering, right?
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.440]   That God's going to use all this.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.000]   So all of that then empowers the Christians to go through these sufferings with a different
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.300]   attitude.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.720]   Not one of dragging their feet, complaining, and wishing there was somebody else.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.440]   Maybe even being tempted that they would not name the name of Christ, but rather that they
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.520]   would have power to go through.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.920]   And tonight, it's the carry-on of that theme of the right perspective and the right attitude
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.320]   going through these tough times.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.600]   And what are the two things, the attitudes that Apostle Peter wants us to have?
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.120]   Well, let's take a look at the passage and then we'll jump forward, okay?
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.600]   Starting from verse 5.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.560]   First Peter chapter 5, verse 5.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.680]   He says, "You younger men likewise, be subject to your elders, and all of you clothe yourselves
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.760]   with humility toward one another.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.080]   For God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.120]   Or humble yourself under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time,
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.320]   casting all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.200]   Be of sober spirit, be on the alert.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.800]   Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.600]   But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.960]   being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.560]   After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:40.000]   eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.520]   To Him be dominion forever and ever.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.520]   Amen.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.800]   Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, for so I regard him, I have written to you briefly,
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.120]   Stand firm in it.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.160]   She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greeting, and so does my son,
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.160]   Mark.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.440]   Greet one another with a kiss of love.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.720]   Peace be to you all who are in Christ.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.960]   From this passage, I emphasize again that Apostle Peter wants us as concluding marks
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.000]   to have a certain perspective and an attitude resulting from that perspective.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.240]   And the two I want to highlight today are the ideas of humility and trust.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   Humility and trust.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.640]   So I'm giving you two words just to hang our hats on and think about for tonight.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.880]   Let's pray and we'll jump into the study.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.320]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your grace.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.280]   I ask, Lord, that you will continue to do a powerful work in us.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:48.000]   For God, we want to have the characteristics, the maturity, the wisdom, the transformation
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.680]   that you desire in us.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.080]   Ultimately, God, we want to exhibit the characteristics of Christ.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.920]   And Father, we know that oftentimes through the various circumstances of life, it becomes
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.920]   so difficult.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.840]   And Lord, we battle with our flesh, we battle with the sin in our hearts and in our minds,
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.120]   but we ask, Lord God, that by your truth and by your spirit working through your truth,
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.320]   Lord, that you would strengthen us.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.240]   That we might truly exhibit the power of the gospel in our lives.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.240]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.240]   Amen.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.240]   Okay.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:27.800]   So, in this, what I've done when I walk through this passage is on your packet, I made some
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:33.120]   notes on the superscript and then underlined and bolded the main commands.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.640]   Just to show you that in this last section, Apostle Peter just does one of those bam,
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.120]   bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, and gives lots of commands.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.240]   But if you look at it in total, again, he's giving many summary commands that aren't so
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.960]   specific as to, oh, I want you to give this money to this, or I want you to, you know,
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.980]   apply this word like this, but it's a lot of general insertion of an attitude that we're
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.680]   supposed to have.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:03.520]   And this perspective and attitude carries on from long ago, back in chapter 2, 13, where
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:10.320]   he started saying, even though you're suffering, I want you to learn how to submit as Christians.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.280]   And so he says, likewise, right, just like he said before, he says, be subject to your
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.680]   elders and all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.280]   For God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:27.200]   Therefore, humble yourself under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you at the proper
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   time.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   Okay.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.880]   So in this first two verses, verse 5 and 6, we notice just a very plain and obvious truth
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.600]   and command.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.880]   God desires us to have the attitude of humility.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.160]   And the command simply is, he wants every single individual, not just the young men,
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.440]   although he calls them out and says, I want you to learn to submit to your church elders.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   Right.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.720]   Now, that part, we get it.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.480]   Young men typically are ambitious.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.080]   Young men can be stubborn.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.680]   Young men could have desires for leadership, whatever it may be.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.080]   And then he commands them again, just like he commanded the previous categories of people,
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.280]   learn to submit.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.720]   But the application goes to everybody, right?
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.960]   There is a uniform, one size fit all dress code.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.520]   I don't know if you guys have gone to high school or something where there's a uniform,
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.520]   everybody looks the same.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:24.080]   There's a sense in which Christianity has a uniform dress code where he says, he wants
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.680]   you to be dressed with humility.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.680]   Okay.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.240]   Now, as we just look at that simple command, I'm not going to sit here and then go like,
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.960]   okay, what is humility, all this kind of stuff.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.720]   I'll do that a little bit later.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.040]   Let's make an observation of the text.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.200]   Let's make an observation of the text and let's identify.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:48.760]   As we walk through verse 5 and 6, what are the reasons apostle Peter gives as to why
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.680]   we should be humble?
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.160]   Why we need to humble ourselves?
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.080]   So I want to throw that question out to you guys, if you guys would just shout it out
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.160]   or raise your hand or just raise your hand.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.800]   What are the observations in terms of why apostle Peter makes this challenge that we
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.760]   should humble ourselves?
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.160]   Yes.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.080]   Excellent.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.520]   Okay.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:27.200]   You can put that in there as in your pride, you are going to be weak against your enemy.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.600]   Okay.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.520]   That is when the enemy has his claws into you.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.920]   That is when he's going to set a stumbling block for you.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.920]   Very good.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.920]   What else do you see?
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   Excellent.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.520]   God gives grace to the humble, but he opposes the proud.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.560]   Right.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.880]   He opposes the proud.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:53.920]   Man, if you think about reasons enough, my goodness, worst thing in the world to have
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.800]   the most powerful being you can possibly imagine who supersedes all that you can imagine be
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   your enemy.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   Right.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   Best thing in the world.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.920]   God gives grace to those who are humble.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:12.560]   What else?
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.560]   And you can look at the whole section together.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.240]   Let's see.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:28.480]   When you look at verse 5, 6, 7 together, that whole concept right there is challenging us
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.960]   to have humility.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.280]   What other concepts do you see?
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:41.200]   So sorry, I didn't mean to just cut it short at verse 6, but inclusive of the other stuff.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.760]   Oh, very good.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.760]   Okay.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:51.200]   So God has a prerogative and his own timetable and he essentially commands us that we need
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.240]   to humble ourselves because God's going to be the one who will exalt, not us.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.240]   Very good.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.240]   Others?
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.240]   Okay.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.680]   Good.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.640]   So we have a couple of those things there and all of those things then come off, just
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.380]   jump out from the passage to us.
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:20.920]   Apostle Peter reiterates twice, you know, that we should humble ourselves.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.700]   In verse 5, telling us to clothe ourselves and verse 6 telling us to humble ourselves
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.860]   underneath the mighty hand of God.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.840]   So if we were to just make, you know, small detail observations, you can add in their
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:38.080]   concepts of because God's mighty hand is over us or just a simple fact because God actually
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.160]   cares for us, right?
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:46.000]   And so these reasons for why we need to humble ourselves start mounting up.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.280]   Now as we think about that command then, this is not just a small command for us, this is
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.340]   an imperative that carries an incredible amount of weight.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.600]   And I want to give a little bit more description here about even that term.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.960]   In verse 5 where it tells us to clothe ourselves with humility, the verbal imagery is pretty
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.600]   profound, okay?
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:15.560]   The literal term in the Greek means to tie oneself either with like a knot or a band,
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.560]   right?
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.480]   And so typically, what do you wear that has some kind of string that you draw or whatever
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.120]   and it's something like an apron, right?
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.480]   A servant who puts on an apron to serve or whatever it may be or an individual who's
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.040]   getting ready to work and so they put on something and they tie it around, right?
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.640]   And so there's this imagery there.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:40.400]   But what's more, we know that Apostle Peter has had an incredible imagery shown to him
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.160]   by Jesus Himself.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:47.080]   Let's turn our Bibles to John chapter 13 verses 1 through 17.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.760]   Story we know well, story definitely worth us giving special attention to as we talk
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:57.680]   about this important topic of humility, okay?
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.680]   So I'm going to start reading for us as now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.160]   knew that His hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.280]   Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.920]   During supper when the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:20.160]   son, to betray Him, Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:25.400]   and that He had come from God and was going back to God, rose from supper.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.640]   He laid aside His outer garments and taking a towel, tied it around His waist.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.080]   Then He poured water into a basin and began to wash disciples' feet and to wipe them
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.600]   with a towel that was wrapped around Him.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.480]   Just a quick note there, I just, this story is beautiful and this story hits so many of
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.200]   the topics that we're going to talk about today.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.400]   I mentioned today's topic is humility and trust.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.520]   Interestingly enough, it even talks about Jesus' trust of the Father in this story.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.080]   Continuing on, verse 6, "He came to Simon Peter who said to him, 'Lord, do you wash
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   my feet?'
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.240]   Jesus answered him, 'What I am doing you do not understand now, but after you will
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.480]   understand.'
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.840]   Peter said to him, 'You shall never wash my feet.'
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:12.000]   And Jesus answered him, 'If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.'"
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.740]   Just a note there, you look at the reason why Peter did not receive Jesus' humble service
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.740]   of washing his feet.
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.760]   And we're going to talk about that a little bit later, so just keep that in your mind.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.280]   Verse 9, "Simon Peter said to Him, 'Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.280]   head then.'
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.320]   Jesus said to him, 'The one who has bathed does not need to wash except for his feet,
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.400]   but is completely clean and you are clean, but not every one of you.'
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.600]   For he knew who was to betray him, that was why he said, 'Not all of you are clean.'
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.760]   When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments, resumed his place, he said
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.040]   to them, 'Do you understand what I have done to you?
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.820]   You shall call me teacher and Lord and you are right, for I am, so I am.
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.400]   If I then, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   feet.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.760]   For I have given you an example that you should do just as I have done to you.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.960]   Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.000]   greater than the one who sent him.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.320]   If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.'"
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.320]   Quite profound.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.640]   Already, there is this challenge for us to clothe ourselves in humility, that the term
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.720]   itself is incredibly vivid and you could almost hear all the tones of all that Peter experienced
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:32.160]   with Christ and there is this challenge from Christ's Word Himself asking this question
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.040]   that's so convicting.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.720]   When it comes to humility, you need to clothe yourself and as he's teaching that to his
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.520]   disciples, he gives this incredibly convicting question.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.680]   A master isn't lower than his slave.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   A slave isn't greater than his master.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.020]   A pupil isn't greater than his teacher, is he?
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.120]   And there is this question even for us when we think about humility, when we think about
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:03.640]   our willingness to put ourselves in a lower, lowly position, do we sometimes think that
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.160]   we're too good to serve in certain capacities?
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.720]   Do we sometimes think that we're too good to stoop down before a brother?
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.600]   Maybe even especially like an actual sibling?
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.600]   Do we sometimes think that we're too good to wash the dirt off of a brother's feet?
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:26.480]   Did Jesus say, "No, blessed are you when you understand that this is what marks a Christian,
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.280]   a follower of Christ, I've set you an example to do."
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.840]   And so it comes down to our perspective because Jesus in asking that question, asked a very
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:42.120]   pointed question about what we think of ourselves, that's the lesson learned.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.920]   How do you think of yourself and in you answering that question that either prevents you from
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:53.440]   following the example of Christ or that's going to allow you to say, "No, I never held
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.040]   on to such a high esteem.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:00.880]   I never thought of myself so greater than my brother that I would have put myself there.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:06.800]   And definitely, most definitely, I'm not greater than my master."
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.760]   So there is this humility that is a challenge for us.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.720]   But we would voluntarily not only give respect where respect is due, but give respect in
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.100]   all places that God desires.
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.040]   Give respect wherever God has placed us.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.560]   Not only we're being humbled because God is humiliating us and putting through all kinds
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.880]   of pain and hurt, but just like Christ as He sees His disciples, as He sees what God
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:36.560]   has given and as He sees what God has placed before Him, He is more than willing to clothe
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:42.600]   Himself, tie the apron so to speak, and serve the disciples before Him.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.160]   So there's a simple truth, right?
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.560]   Let's be humble, you know.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.480]   But can I tell you honestly for me, like, you know, one of the struggles in terms of
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.880]   sins that I had early on was just, man, I was such an arrogant individual.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:06.640]   And back when I was a new believer and stuff, I really felt like, man, because I struggle
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.200]   with pride and arrogance so much, I just kind of assumed you either are like born with it
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.200]   or you're not.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.480]   Meaning I almost got to a point where I just kind of said, like, "You think a certain
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   way.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.480]   I'm not going to change."
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.480]   You know?
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.840]   And I remember a time where every time, you know, as a young believer, you're like super
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.880]   gung-ho and you want to serve the Lord or you start learning like, you know, four guitar
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.960]   chords and you think you're the bomb, like whatever it may be, everything in church started
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.600]   turning into pride and pride.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.080]   And sometimes you learn theology and then you, you know, go pick a fight with your pastor.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.760]   I did all of that, you know?
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.400]   And I remember just thinking, like, some people are just humble and some people are not.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.560]   I was in the category of pride.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.120]   That's how I thought, just being honest with you, right?
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.240]   But truthfully speaking, that is not the way the Scriptures speak to us.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:00.760]   The Scripture is challenging us with the simple truth that us as followers of Christ all need
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.480]   to hold ourselves.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.600]   And it is an imperative that we need to do.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:11.720]   It is a, what I like to call, the reflexive verb where you humble yourself, right?
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.400]   You put yourself under the mighty hand of God.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.980]   You put yourself willingly under other people and you teach yourself.
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.240]   You have to wrestle with yourself.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.480]   And I just want to, you know, as I was thinking about this passage, I was sitting here thinking,
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.440]   "Oh my goodness, you know, like, oh my goodness, you know, like, this is the beauty of the
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.920]   Scripture where, like, part of me didn't want to teach this because, yeah, I'm being, talking
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.320]   about humility for a guy who struggles so much with a perception of self.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.800]   Like, how do people see me wanting to succeed, afraid of failure, all that kind of stuff.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.620]   There's so much pride in me.
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:50.060]   And then to teach on this subject, I didn't know how to think of it, you know?
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.060]   And there's a question that I was asking as I was preparing this, like, how do I take
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:58.740]   this simple truth where you need to be humble and not allow it to just simply skim at the
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.020]   surface and just say, "Okay, we get that, right?
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.900]   We're all going to be, you know, trying to be humble, okay?"
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.680]   And just let it go.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.940]   And so what I'm going to do right now is do two part.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:13.540]   One, let's really think deeply about what humility is by also being convicted about
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.980]   the various ways we actually are prideful.
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:23.340]   But what's more, what always is going to cause us to see that sin of arrogance and pride
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:29.260]   in its right perspective, and we're talking about perspective today, is when we realize
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.300]   how God sees that pride in us.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:38.860]   Another way to put that is how much is pride despicable in the eyes of our God?
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:45.900]   So at this time, I'm going to put up some verses on here on the PowerPoint for us, just
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:50.920]   so that we can get through a good amount of passages and talk about this question.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:57.300]   We want to be convicted that surely we want to be people marked by an attitude of humility.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.020]   Then in terms of the opposite, the pride in us, what is it?
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.020]   Okay?
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.620]   First, pride seeks self-satisfaction.
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.100]   Pride seeks self-satisfaction.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.340]   There's a passage from Hosea chapter 4 verse 9.
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.580]   Oh nice, thank you.
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.580]   Okay.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:30.300]   And I'm going to read Hosea chapter 13 verse 4 through 9.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.980]   And it says, "But I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt.
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.920]   You know no God but me, and besides me there is no Savior.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.420]   It was I who knew you in the wilderness and the land of the drowned.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:45.740]   But when you had grazed, they became full, and they were filled, and their hearts were
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:46.940]   lifted up.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.600]   Therefore they forgot me.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.860]   So I am to them like a lion, like a leopard will lurk beside the way.
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:59.060]   I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of her cubs to tear open their breasts.
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:05.500]   And there I will devour them like a lion as a wild beast would rip them open."
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.980]   Quite scary, is it not?
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:13.020]   When there is this arrogance in us that says, "I had my fill, now I don't need you, so forget
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.020]   you."
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:20.660]   He says, "I will be to you like a huge bear, mother bear who's just been robbed of her
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.660]   cubs."
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:26.100]   That's incredibly like, you know, vivid, you know?
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:30.300]   I'm not sure if you guys have seen that gruesome movie, Revenant or whatever, Revenant, I forgot
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.300]   how to pronounce it.
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.460]   It's a gruesome sight, right?
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:42.660]   So you ask that question, when it comes to how much God detests an arrogance.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:46.340]   An arrogance where you say, "Because I have enough, I don't need you, I don't need him,
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.340]   I don't need them."
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.980]   And I don't know if you guys have ever interacted with people like that.
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.440]   It will boil you inside.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.560]   People who use people, people who just simply are dismissive because, "Hey, if you're not
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.320]   for me, if you're not held to me, then I don't need you in my life."
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.560]   God describes it in very vivid terms.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.720]   Here's another passage.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.360]   The point here is, pride believes in self-sufficiency.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.960]   Pride believes in self-sufficiency.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:19.080]   Let's turn our Bibles to Deuteronomy, chapter 8.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.080]   And I'm going to read from verse 15 through 18.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.800]   Okay, Deuteronomy, chapter 8, verse 15 through 18.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:28.040]   Remember, the nation, after they've been traveling through the wilderness, sorry, in front of
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.040]   the plains of Moab, getting ready to go over into the land of Canaan, and Moses is saying,
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.320]   "You guys need to listen up.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.720]   Because so far, it's just been sin, sin, sin, and I need to reiterate God's law to you so
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.240]   that we can have success when we go in."
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:45.720]   Well, as he's talking about that, look at the convicting words that he says, starting
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.720]   from verse 15.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.920]   "Who led you," or he's going to describe to them how they have houses and all this kind
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.600]   of stuff, they've multiplied and everything, but God's the one who's doing this, but they're
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.600]   forgetting God.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.560]   God's the one who led you through the great and terrifying wilderness with its fiery serpents
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.720]   and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water, who brought you water out of
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:12.920]   the flinty rock, who fed you and the wilderness with manna that your fathers did not know,
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.000]   that He might humble you and test you to do you good in the end.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.760]   Beware, lest you say in your heart," what do they say?
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.920]   "My power and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth."
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:30.960]   So he says, "You shall remember the Lord your God, for it was He who gives you power to
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.960]   get wealth."
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.960]   Right?
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.680]   The heart of the arrogant, the heart of those who are prideful constantly think, "I am capable.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.680]   I can do this."
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   Right?
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.640]   It's the mantra of, "If I just believe hard enough, if I just try hard enough, I probably
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.080]   can."
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.160]   Not only that, but just thinking, "I am sufficient in myself."
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.760]   What's more?
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.760]   Pride puts self above instruction.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.160]   Okay?
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.520]   Pride puts self above instruction.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.520]   What do we mean by this?
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:08.240]   Well, when you take a look at Jeremiah chapter 13, verses 8 through 10, okay?
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.360]   Jeremiah chapter 13, verses 8 through 10.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:17.520]   I'm going to take a moment to turn there real fast.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.520]   He says this, "Then the word of the Lord came to me.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:26.120]   Thus says the Lord, 'Even so, I will spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.500]   Jerusalem.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:32.560]   This evil people who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their heart and have
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:38.120]   gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth which is
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.600]   good for nothing.'"
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.600]   Right?
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:46.000]   When you think about that again, you hear the frustration in God as He speaks to the
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.160]   prophet to the nation.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.440]   You asked for prophets.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.080]   You asked for prophecies.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.400]   You know the people were always in custom of going to the prophets any time they went
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.800]   into battle, any time they had a change in leadership, any time they did anything profound,
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   they would ask God for counsel and blessing.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.640]   But in the end, they just do whatever they want.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.640]   Right?
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.000]   In the end, they just continue to do whatever they think is best.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.600]   Typically, those who are arrogant continue to put themselves above instruction.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.600]   They're insubordinate.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   They think they know.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.600]   Right?
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.160]   And there are sometimes people who I find even in modern day, they'll come to me for
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.160]   counsel.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.080]   They'll come to Pastor Peter for counsel.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.480]   And they'll come to an older brother for counsel.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.880]   Then they'll come to an elder for counsel.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   And in the end, they'll just do whatever they want.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.120]   And I'm sitting there like, "Oh, my goodness.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.120]   Why?
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.640]   Why did you even ask everybody?"
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.200]   A lot of times what they were doing was they were trying to wait to find or ask around
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.880]   to find someone who would say what they wanted to hear.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.360]   The fact of the matter is, what that reveals is, they're still wanting to do whatever they
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.360]   want.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.920]   What's more, pride takes the glory.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.960]   Okay?
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.960]   Pride takes the glory.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.800]   You guys remember the story of Daniel and King Nebuchadnezzar?
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:07.200]   King Nebuchadnezzar essentially was a madman in many ways because he set up like a huge
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.680]   statue of himself and he expected everybody to worship.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:15.280]   And in the end, as King Nebuchadnezzar continued to have his kingdom grow, he was standing
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.040]   upon his palace looking out and all of a sudden he had a moment of glory.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.360]   And this is what it says.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.840]   Verse 29, "At the end of the 12 months, he was walking on the rooftop of the royal palace
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.040]   of Babylon.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:33.000]   And the king answered and said, 'Is not this great Babylon which I have built by my mighty
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.620]   power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?'"
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:42.120]   And then it says, "While the word was still in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.800]   heaven, 'O King of Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken, the kingdom has departed from
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.800]   you.'"
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.120]   And God literally puts his face on the ground and makes him graze on the grass and makes
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.000]   him into like a beast.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.560]   And then later on the king realizes like, "What in the world was I thinking?"
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:06.560]   And once he comes to his senses, if you scroll down to verse 37, this is what, or 36 and
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.760]   37, this is what King Nebuchadnezzar says.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.800]   36, "At the same time, my reason returned to me and for the glory of my kingdom, my
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.480]   majesty and splendor returned to me.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:20.320]   My counselors and my Lord sought me and I was established in my kingdom and still more
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.400]   greatness was added to me.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:27.600]   But now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven for all his works
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.960]   are right and his ways are just and those who walk in pride, he is able to humble."
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.960]   Okay?
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.580]   He is able to humble.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:42.420]   We ask that question again of just how detestable is pride in the eyes of God?
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:47.040]   And scripture teaches us repeatedly that God will not stand for that.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.720]   As a matter of fact, even in the passage that we're looking at, it says very specifically
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:56.080]   and he quotes verbatim the Old Testament saying, "God is opposed to those who are arrogant
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.080]   and prideful."
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:04.920]   What's more, Jesus himself taught against haughty eyes and pride that seeks the praise
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.920]   of men.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.000]   So the next point is pride seeks the praise of men.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.680]   Jesus said in Matthew 23 verses 6 through 12, okay?
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:20.040]   Matthew chapter 23 verses 6 through 12, "And they," that is the Pharisees, "love the place
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.040]   of honor."
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.080]   They love the places of honor at the feasts, the best seats in the synagogues, and greetings
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.440]   in the marketplaces, and being called rabbi by others.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.760]   "But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher and all are brothers.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.800]   And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father who is in heaven.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.600]   Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.840]   The greatest among you shall be your servant.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.480]   Whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:55.600]   Man, and then you actually, if you look at the rest of that chapter, he goes off and
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.760]   he says, "Woe to you hypocrites.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.720]   You look so great on the outside.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:06.120]   You clean everything so that everybody can see, but you're just filled with wickedness
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.120]   and vile things."
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.120]   Right?
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:14.600]   Those were Christ's harsh words to those who had this desire for the praise of men.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:20.400]   So we ask the question of, man, how, again, I'm just kind of being repetitive here, but
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:24.620]   I want to add the weight of how much Scripture talks about this.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:30.520]   In terms of asking how God is angered and frustrated, not frustrated as in like, "Oh
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:35.480]   man, he's threatened by our pride and what we can accomplish."
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:40.160]   In many ways, there's indignation of God toward those who are prideful.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.280]   And there was a clear example of this in the book of Acts chapter 12 verses 20 through
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.280]   23.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.280]   Okay?
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:51.200]   Basically, King Herod, who was frustrated because Apostle Paul and other people were
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.880]   constantly teaching and he felt like he couldn't, he was in a bit losing control.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:02.640]   And as he was moving from one city to this area in Tyre, the people regarded him in high
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.640]   honor.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.680]   And this is what happens, verse 20.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:10.920]   "Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:15.720]   And having persuaded Blastas, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.600]   depended on the king's country for food.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:24.000]   On an appointed day, Herod put out his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.080]   delivered an oration to them.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.280]   And the people were shouting, 'The voice of God and not a man!'"
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.000]   You know, they're shouting, "Oh, this must be a God!"
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.960]   But then look at this, verse 23, "Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.400]   he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last."
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:46.220]   Lastly, I want to make this statement.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:52.780]   So far we went down this idea of how selfish pride is, how self-sufficient pride is, right?
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.840]   How insubordinate, unyielding, you know?
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.040]   How just kind of like stubborn and whatnot.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:06.240]   But as we go through this, we realize pride continues to compete with God for His glory.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.500]   Pride continues to compete with God for His agenda and His will.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:15.240]   And if that continues to happen, what will happen is that pride will ultimately oppose
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:19.800]   the very existence of God.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:24.740]   Pride will oppose the very existence of God.
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:30.160]   In Psalm chapter 10, verse 4 and on, this is what the Scripture says, okay?
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:35.400]   "In the pride of His face, the wicked does not seek Him.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:39.120]   All His thoughts are, 'There is no God.'"
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.700]   Did you catch that?
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:47.180]   For those who are prideful in His thoughts all day is, "There is no God, there is no
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:48.180]   God."
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.180]   Why?
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:50.180]   They can't be!
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:55.140]   If I'm seeking glory of men, if I feel like I deserve worship, then God is a threat to
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:58.580]   me, right?
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:02.620]   God has no place in my perspective.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:09.020]   What's wrong with the heart of pride is there is then no room for the majesty of God.
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.920]   There is no room for the will of the Father.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:16.280]   And so pride stands very opposed to God's presence Himself.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.940]   And the only final solution to that is, "I need to get rid of God."
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:25.020]   You can say that many people cried out for the crucifixion of Jesus because they were
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.020]   selfish.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.720]   They wanted a Savior who was going to give them power, right?
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.380]   But if you look at the heart of the Pharisees, they got rid of Jesus because they were jealous
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.380]   of His power.
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.380]   They were jealous of His glory.
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:40.340]   There was no room in their religion for the Christ.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:45.340]   Because Christ had to become greater and everybody else had to become less.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:51.340]   And so likewise, if we allow arrogance and pride to reside in our life, you will, you
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:56.620]   will by nature of your pride, push God out.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:02.700]   You will by the nature of your pride continue to minimize His power, continue to minimize
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:09.300]   His will, and everything in terms of perspective will cater to your glory.
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:14.940]   And so that's why the passage says, "You need to humble yourself, for God opposes the
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.620]   problem, gives grace to the humble.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:27.780]   And if not, you make yourself as one who stands, stands, challenging the God Almighty."
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:34.340]   Now that first section then, I hope that I wanted to give just an encouraging and also
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.260]   a convicting challenge.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.980]   There are times when we repent of certain sins because we see it as heinous.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:47.220]   If any of you have felt the conviction in your heart after maybe you said a lie, if
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:51.500]   any of you have ever felt a conviction in your heart after you did something hurtful
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.580]   and your brother or sister in church or your family member or somebody was in tears because
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.020]   of your sin.
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:01.140]   If ever you had felt a sense of brokenness because maybe of sexual sin or whatever and
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:05.180]   you felt like, "Oh, that was dirty."
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.220]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:13.580]   Have you ever felt a sense of brokenness where the same kind of weight, same kind of remorse
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:17.900]   hits you because of words of arrogance that came out of your mouth?
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:21.540]   Because you realize the kind of arrogance that's in your heart really stands opposed
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:26.900]   to God Almighty and in terms of the things that He hates, pride stands of one of the
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.580]   top things that He absolutely abhors?
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.260]   Do we have a perspective like that?
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:36.980]   Not only are the sins that are heinous the ones that cause the greatest amount of pain
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:43.060]   to me and my friends, but the sins that are actually truly heinous are the ones that really
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:47.020]   challenge God, right?
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:50.580]   And where we think the next best runner up for God is ourselves.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:54.460]   When was the last time you were broken over arrogance?
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:58.220]   You were broken over your pride?
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:05.140]   I want to make a transition into the next section.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:11.920]   You will notice that as He talks about the arrogance and as He talks about the humility
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:17.660]   that we need to have, the challenge for us to clothe ourselves and humble ourselves under
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:23.340]   the mighty hand of God, there's also this concept that runs so closely into it.
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:27.900]   He says that He may exalt you in the proper time and what's more, He says casting all
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:33.380]   your anxiety on Him because He cares for you, right?
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.980]   Because He cares for you.
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.980]   And earlier when I asked that question, what were the motivations that you observed in
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:44.780]   this passage that taught us to be humble, that those motivations all pointed to our
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.860]   trust in the Father?
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:52.180]   Whether it be our trust in the might of His hand, but also our trust in the care of His
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.540]   hand.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:59.460]   And so what you see is that the attitude Apostle Peter wants us to have is an attitude of trust
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.380]   in verse 6 and 7.
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.580]   But I ask this question.
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.640]   This is super important for us to understand.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:11.340]   As we think about the challenge for us to be humble in our hearts and also as we think
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:17.740]   about this challenge where He says in verse 7, "Cast all your anxiety upon Him," right?
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.420]   How do the two intersect?
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:26.540]   Meaning what's the relationship between our humility and our ability to trust in God,
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.540]   right?
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.540]   Our ability to trust in God.
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:36.700]   Because the passage and even in its own grammar joins the two like it's supposed to be attached.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.340]   What do I mean by that?
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:44.380]   Well in some versions of the Bible, those of verse 6 and verse 7 will be separated.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:50.580]   But that verse actually is one long sentence and the thought continues on.
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:54.320]   Well the way I want to ask is this.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.980]   We obviously know that, you know, just from the grammar and all that kind of stuff and
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:07.900]   just intuitionally, yeah, if I don't believe that God is mighty, then I'm not going to
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.540]   you know like trust Him.
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:13.580]   We instinctually know if I don't believe that God is caring, then of course I'm not going
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.740]   to trust Him, you know?
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:20.660]   But my question is not so much, okay, you have to have that humility to trust or whatever,
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:25.320]   or sorry, sorry, not so much that you believe in His might or whatever, but there is this
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:31.460]   question where the challenge for you to humble yourself underneath that is tied in with your
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.780]   ability to trust.
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.820]   What am I saying here?
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:41.300]   There's a sense in which talking in a counseling manner, talking in the respective of our own
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:46.100]   lives, there are times where we have anxieties, there are times when we have fears.
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.820]   Could it be that in those moments it's not just a simple issue of, "Well I just need
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.380]   to trust."
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:56.620]   Could it be that there are deeper issues and the deeper issues that I'm talking about are
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:00.460]   issues of pride, right?
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:05.220]   That moments when we're not enjoying the peace of God, moments when we're not enjoying that
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:10.620]   kind of confidence in our Father, the thing that's keeping us away from that could be
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.700]   because there's an arrogance with us.
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:18.420]   There's maybe not so much like a bombastic, "Hey, look at me," kind of arrogance, but
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.300]   maybe there's a resilient pride.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:26.060]   Maybe there are things that are causing us to not be able to overcome that hurdle towards
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.340]   having confidence and trust in God.
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:32.740]   So again, asking the question, and I want you guys to just think about this.
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:36.100]   Why does trust in God equate with our humility?
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:42.340]   Or another way to put it is, why is humility a prerequisite, required for us to exercise
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.340]   trust in God?
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:47.060]   Well here are two points underneath that question.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:56.920]   The first, for us to actually have trust in our Father, we have to accept a lowly reality
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:02.020]   of ourselves.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:07.660]   When we are exercising trust in our Heavenly Father, there is an acceptance of the reality,
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:12.620]   "I do not have X, Y, and Z, or I cannot do X, Y, and Z.
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:18.620]   In the position that I'm in, I admit and confess, I am in need.
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.620]   I am vulnerable.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:24.100]   I require help."
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.420]   This is a humble admission that we need to understand, and that is why Jesus, when He
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:31.660]   talks about those who are blessed, He will say, "Blessed are those who are meek.
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.380]   Blessed are those who are poor."
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.580]   Because they understand reality.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.620]   They understand how things actually are.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:43.500]   And the lie that we often believe is, "No, you don't need.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.500]   I don't need Him.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.500]   I don't need Her.
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.500]   And definitely, I don't need God."
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.500]   Right?
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:50.780]   That's the kind of lies that sometimes we're attacked by.
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:56.900]   But secondly, our ability to trust comes with the high reality of God.
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:57.900]   Right?
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.820]   The high reality of God.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:07.260]   Only in humility can you understand in faith the supreme power of God.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:12.260]   Only in humility can you just acquiesce and then give that and relinquish that kind of
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.180]   authority, that kind of credence to God Almighty.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.420]   And that's what we're talking about right now.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:25.220]   And right here, at this point, is where our enemy seeks to devour.
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:32.020]   At this point is where our enemy works his most, you know, devious schemes.
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.660]   Is through lies.
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.260]   Lies about yourself.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:39.300]   Lies about God so that you cannot trust.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:44.740]   Every time I counsel an individual, whether it be through the struggles of life, of anxieties,
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:49.880]   again, my honest belief is every single one of us, because we're struggling with the flesh,
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.300]   we are afraid.
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.420]   Right?
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:56.980]   Even those individuals who come off like they're the man, you know, they have fears.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:01.980]   Every man struggles with the fear of failure, you know, just going to confess that.
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:06.100]   When it comes to their work, their labor, the greatest fear is like the fear of having
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.740]   their work not amount to anything.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:11.300]   Fear of feeling like they're not being productive.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:15.700]   Fear of not being able to provide, not being able to produce, you know what I mean?
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.240]   There's fear of being disrespected because of all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.100]   We have fears and anxieties over the things that we don't know.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.260]   We have fears and anxieties over the future.
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.420]   We have fears and anxieties over rejections.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:30.300]   And people are so afraid of stuff like that, that that's why people have things, silly
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:35.740]   things like fear of, you know, stage, being on the stage, fear of sharing and speaking,
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:36.740]   you know?
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:40.000]   And that kind of stuff really, really grips us.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.620]   We struggle with that.
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:42.620]   Right?
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:48.220]   But as we think about that, every time we try to tackle one of those fears, we realize
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.660]   those are the moments.
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:57.100]   And our enemy latches on and tries to give us lies, especially about the reality of how
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.340]   we view in a grand scale ourself and God.
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:04.740]   So for example, the fear of future, you're never going to get a job.
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.780]   You're never going to amount to anything, you know?
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.460]   And people exaggerate that kind of stuff all the time.
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:14.860]   I'll ask people who are very, very like in a moment of despair, like I haven't found
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:15.860]   a job.
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:20.060]   And they'll say stuff without even knowing, like I'm never going to find a job.
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.100]   What does that do to your hope?
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.420]   What does that do to your psyche?
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.420]   Satan's over there saying, "That's right, give up, you know?
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.300]   That's right, just throw in the towel.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.780]   It's pointless anyway."
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:36.420]   This is the moment Satan desires to devour you.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.420]   What else?
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.420]   Lies.
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:39.420]   Lies.
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:40.420]   Lies about God.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.420]   God doesn't care.
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.420]   God doesn't care.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:50.020]   I don't know how many people, this simple verse in 1 Peter I had to use and then talk
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:54.580]   to people and say, "This passage is so powerful for you."
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:58.700]   Because whether you're willing to admit it or not, by the way you talk, the little subtle
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:04.380]   things you say, you have believed a huge, huge lie.
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.620]   Great deception of Satan.
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:10.020]   Convincing you God doesn't see you.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.820]   God totally missed you.
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:12.820]   God doesn't care about you.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:13.820]   He doesn't want to use you.
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:14.980]   He doesn't have a purpose for you.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:18.180]   He just doesn't care about you.
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.180]   What a lie.
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.780]   What a lie.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.580]   But often times it's through struggle and hardship where Satan will use that and say,
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:27.740]   "See, I told you.
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:28.740]   Nobody cares."
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:29.740]   You know?
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.260]   And then people will actually come to me.
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.540]   They'll come to me and say, "Pastor, I'm thinking about leaving this church."
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.540]   "Why?"
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.540]   "Because nobody cares."
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:37.540]   "Nobody cares?
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:38.540]   Really?
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.540]   Like I don't care.
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.540]   I'm someone in the church.
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.540]   You think I don't care?"
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:42.540]   You know?
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:43.540]   And they're like, "Not you, but nobody else cares."
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:44.540]   You know?
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:45.540]   "But that's what you said.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.540]   Did you hear yourself?"
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:47.540]   "Let me ask you a question.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:48.540]   Did you go around serving everybody?
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:49.540]   Can I just ask you a question today?
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:50.540]   Do you care?"
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:51.540]   You know?
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:52.540]   But no, what has Satan done?
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:53.540]   He lied to you.
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.540]   This is how, I ask you this question for homework.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:55.540]   How does Satan in real life try to devour you?
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:56.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:57.540]   He devours you with lies.
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.540]   And this is where we need to fight.
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:46:59.540]   Right here in the moment of faith.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.540]   And that's why he'll even talk about that in his passes, does he not?
[00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:01.540]   Because he's a liar.
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:02.540]   He's a liar.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.540]   He's a liar.
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:04.540]   He's a liar.
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.540]   And I want to tell you something.
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:06.540]   I want to tell you something.
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:07.540]   I want to tell you something.
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:31.540]   He devours you with lies.
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:38.540]   And I want to tell you something.
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:39.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:40.540]   He devours you with lies.
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.540]   And I want to tell you something.
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:42.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:43.540]   He devours you with lies.
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   And I want to tell you something.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:45.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.540]   He devours you with lies.
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.540]   And I want to tell you something.
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:48.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:49.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:50.540]   He devours you with lies.
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:51.540]   And I want to tell you something.
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:52.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:54.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:55.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:00.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:01.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:04.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:05.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:07.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:08.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:09.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:10.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:12.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:13.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:16.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:17.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:18.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:20.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:22.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:23.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:26.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:27.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:28.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:29.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:32.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:33.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:34.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:35.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:36.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:37.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:38.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:39.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:40.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:42.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.540]   He devours you with deception.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:50.300]   In the scriptures, in Isaiah chapter 51 verse 12, and I would like you to turn to this passage
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.140]   because it's very important.
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:49:02.420]   God is going to combine this idea of humility and trust and commend us as you're going through
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:07.020]   the hardest times of your life, as you're going through great difficulty.
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:11.140]   You need to have both these attitudes.
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:12.180]   And this is what God says.
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:16.540]   So Isaiah chapter 51 starting from verse 12.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:22.260]   He says, "I, I'm he who comforts you.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:27.500]   Who are you that you are afraid of man who dies?
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:32.260]   Of the son of man who is made like grass and have forgotten the Lord your maker who stretched
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:36.780]   out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth and you fear continually all day
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:41.740]   because of the wrath of the oppressors when he sets himself to destroy?
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.300]   And where is the wrath of the oppressors?"
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:49.420]   This is a really interesting passage, but essentially what is happening is the people
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:54.700]   have failed to trust God and they are living in fear, running away from their enemies.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.340]   And God doesn't say, "Oh, you poor thing."
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:57.340]   He rebukes them.
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.340]   And what does he say?
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:03.340]   He rebukes them and says, "How prideful you are.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.100]   Who do you think you are?"
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.860]   That's the question God asks.
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.180]   Who are you?
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:14.060]   Who are you that you're afraid of man?
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.220]   Now we asked the question, why is God asking that question?
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:22.660]   Because when you do not trust, you indirectly accuse God.
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:28.060]   When you do not have this confidence, you indirectly doubt.
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:29.060]   You accuse God.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.740]   Are you really mighty?
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.540]   Are you really in control?
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:33.540]   You accuse God.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.780]   Do you really care?
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:42.140]   Our inability to have confidence in God is arrogant.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:43.140]   It is.
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:46.700]   I mean, imagine regular people talking to each other that way.
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:52.340]   As a matter of fact, there was this one time I went to an interesting retreat with an interesting
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:53.780]   group of people.
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:54.940]   And it wasn't the recent one.
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:56.300]   It was a long time ago.
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.180]   And there was this young lady who I started doing small talk with.
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:01.900]   And for some reason, I felt like I couldn't get beyond the small talk.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:06.380]   Well, by the last night, I went by and I was like, "Oh, you know, it's the last night.
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:07.380]   How are you doing?"
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:08.380]   You know, she was like, "I'm good."
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.260]   And I was like, "Cool."
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.460]   And I started trying to do this more small talk.
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:14.300]   So I said, "You learning this stuff?"
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:20.900]   And she was kind of like, "I don't know what to say."
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:23.700]   So I was like, "Oh, maybe it sounds like you're not doing that well."
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.380]   She was like, "I'm just tired of the small talk."
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:28.860]   I was like, "Okay.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:29.860]   Why?"
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:31.820]   You know, "I'm just trying here."
[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:33.060]   And she was like, "It's so fake."
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:38.260]   I was like, "Dang."
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:43.300]   And I kind of looked at her and I said, "Well, you judged me for being fake.
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.060]   I'm going to judge you for being arrogant."
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:48.300]   "Man, I don't even know what to say to you.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:52.780]   You just judged me for being fake because you didn't believe I actually asked you.
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:56.140]   Yes, it's small talk, but I actually asked you because I care."
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:52:00.420]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:03.740]   Sometimes we treat God like that.
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:11.100]   Where in our lack of confidence, where God says to the Scriptures, "Believe me, trust
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.420]   me, reside in me, take my comfort, let me heal you."
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:18.540]   But we let that blow off and we keep seeking to protect ourselves.
[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:23.340]   We keep seeking to put up our fences, to put up our defenses, to retaliate, whatever it
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:28.180]   may be, when we don't realize that every single one of those efforts actually is accusing
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.180]   God.
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.660]   You have to trust that you care.
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:35.780]   But if you talk like that to anybody else at church, then you're just going to blow
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:36.780]   off everybody.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.220]   "You're fake, you're fake, you don't really care.
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.220]   Don't ask me questions."
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.940]   What is that?
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.460]   Isn't that arrogance?
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:52.700]   And so, we make this challenge and we start to understand, how is our trust in God connected
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.700]   to our humility?
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:53:01.540]   When we have pride in our hearts, we neglect ourselves, we void ourselves of the privilege
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:05.660]   of having that sweet peace and confidence in God.
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:11.020]   So that's why God is saying, especially in this moment when you're going through great
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:15.220]   persecution and suffering and all the pains that you're going through, go through this
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.220]   with humility.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:20.780]   And one of the most humble things you can do, believe it or not, is to be carefree with
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:21.780]   God.
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.740]   Is to be care resolved.
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:26.500]   There are things that I'm anxious for, there are things that I'm worried, there are things
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:32.340]   that I'm fearful, but I have a resolution in the character and the power of God.
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:35.540]   That's humility expressed.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:41.340]   As we believe that God truly is both mighty and that He truly does care for us.
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:46.100]   And so by a way of final exhortation, we as Christians are going to wrestle with that
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.100]   all the time.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.700]   We're going to wrestle with our pride and then we're going to wrestle with our confidence
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:51.700]   in God.
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:52.980]   And that's what Paul the Peter is going to say.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:59.740]   Be sober, be clear minded, be alert, be ready, so that you would stand firm in the strong
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:00.740]   belief.
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:07.200]   That you would stand firm in the belief that God absolutely cares for you.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:12.660]   Even if all of life, everything's going sour and one by one things are starting to collapse
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:15.980]   and you just feel like, man, I feel like God has it out for me.
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:19.940]   I feel like I'm the target of God's attack even.
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.020]   Believe and stand firm.
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:27.420]   God has chosen you, given you an amazing calling and an incredible purpose to use you.
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:32.540]   So that as we believe this, as we understand God, we would rid ourselves of all the defenses,
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:37.540]   all the prideful talk, all the like, you know, stern face, thick skin, and all things would
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:41.980]   be released so that we would enjoy the fruit of a church that's really humble with God
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:43.460]   and humble with each other.
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:48.660]   Where we're not being defensive with each other, so cautious walking on eggshells.
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:52.280]   We're actually humble, receiving, open, vulnerable.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:57.660]   Enjoy the benefits of not competing with each other, looking out for each other, right?
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:01.780]   But rather that we're actually in peace with one another.
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:06.860]   And so I pray that just as Apostle Peter has said, that we would be able to go through
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:11.700]   every experience and every season of our lives with a great perspective.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:17.100]   God is the one with a mighty hand and a careful hand in which we can entrust ourselves.
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.100]   Amen?
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:25.700]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:31.020]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you so much, God.
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:40.500]   Just to think that you are so relentless to teach those who often are stubborn.
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:43.580]   We confess, God, that sometimes we can be slow to change.
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:46.420]   We can be slow to come around.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:52.500]   But I ask that we would be ever growing and trying to understand truly how powerful you
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.780]   are and truly how loving you are.
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:58.460]   And that, God, we would continue just to be forgetful of ourselves because we trust you
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.460]   so much.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:04.300]   That, God, we don't sit here wringing our hands about what we're going to do, what's
[00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:09.860]   going to come of us, and what's going to happen to us because we absolutely trust you.
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:14.220]   I pray, Father God, that you would grant to us great faith so that we can continue to
[00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:22.580]   withstand the attacks of our enemy who continues to seek to put into our hearts filth, filth
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:27.180]   of arrogance, filth of thinking way too highly of ourselves.
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:31.740]   I pray, Father God, that more and more rather than making much of our own lives, Lord, we
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:34.060]   would make much of your great love.
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:38.580]   Father, we thank you so much and pray again that through the week you would grant to us
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:40.540]   just a constant steady trust in you.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:41.900]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:42.340]   Amen.
