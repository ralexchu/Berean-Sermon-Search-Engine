[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240]   Well, did Abraham laugh God off in unbelief?
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.000]   It's a great question and it comes to us from Jessica who lives in the Netherlands.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.680]   "Dear Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.800]   In Genesis, we read of Abraham going along with Sarah's plan with Hagar to make Ishmael
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.800]   his heir."
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.320]   That's Genesis 16, verses 1 to 16.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.960]   "Later, when God tells him, he and Sarah will bear a child at 190 years old, respectively,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.440]   he seems to laugh it off in unbelief."
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.680]   That's Genesis 17, 17.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.520]   "Therefore, how is it that in Romans chapter 4, Paul celebrates Abraham's unwavering faith?"
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.400]   Does it tell us anything about how God views our own wavering faith in the end?
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to Jessica?
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.700]   This is a good example of how careful we should be not to read into a text something from
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:06.340]   our own experience that makes an interpretation seem likely, but rather let the context decide
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.560]   whether it's likely or not.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:18.380]   So the question is, did Abraham's laughter in Genesis 17, 17 signify the kind of weakened
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.920]   faith or unbelieving doubt, wavering as she calls it, because that's the way it's translated
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.760]   in Romans, that Paul said Abraham did not have?
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.560]   Is Genesis 17, 17 in conflict with what Paul says?
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.060]   So the Old Testament context goes like this.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.340]   This is Genesis 17, 15 following.
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:50.340]   "God said to Abraham, 'As for Sarai, your wife, you shall not call her name.'"
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.860]   Is somebody chopping down a tree?
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.860]   Yes, they're sawing somewhere.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.400]   I hope it's not one of my trees.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.080]   Well stop now.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.520]   Let's see if we can continue.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.900]   Go ahead and pick it up where you left off.
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.000]   The Old Testament context goes like this.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.240]   This is Genesis 17, 15 to 17.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:18.240]   "God said to Abraham, 'As for Sarai, your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.240]   Sarai shall be her name.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   I will bless her, and moreover, I will give you a son by her.'"
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:34.200]   Now this is at 90 years old for her and barren all her life, and now postmenopausal, according
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   to 1811.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:44.600]   "I will bless her, and she shall become nations, kings of peoples shall come from her.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.760]   Then Abraham fell on his face."
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.760]   This is the key verse.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.760]   This is verse 17.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.900]   "Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said to himself, 'Shall a child be born to
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.400]   a man who is a hundred years old?
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.560]   Shall Sarah, who is 90 years old, bear a child?'"
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.960]   Now here's what Paul says about Abraham's faith at that time, and the reason this matters
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:18.240]   for us is that Paul makes clear in Romans 4.23 that these words were not spoken just
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.200]   for Abraham, but for us also, so that the righteousness that was imputed to him might
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.720]   be imputed to us through faith alone as well.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.160]   So this is not a merely marginal illustration for Paul.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.320]   This is central to our own faith.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.800]   So here's Paul's description of Abraham's response to God at that time.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.360]   Here's Romans 4.17.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.960]   "God says to Abraham, 'I have made you the father of many nations in the presence
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:56.400]   of the God in whom you believed,'" referring back to 15.6 of Genesis, "who gives life
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.000]   to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.280]   In hope he believed against hope that he should become the father of many nations, as he had
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.400]   been told, 'So shall your offspring be.'
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.360]   He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead since
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.640]   he was about a hundred years old, or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.640]   womb.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.520]   No unbelief made him waver."
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.440]   Now literally the translation there is, "He did not doubt in unbelief concerning the promise
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.320]   of God, but he grew strong."
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.000]   Literally, he was strengthened—passive voice—"he was strengthened in faith, giving glory to
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.840]   God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.600]   That is why faith was counted to him as righteousness."
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   Now that's the end of Paul's assessment of Abraham's faith there in Genesis 17.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.560]   So six times Paul affirms Abraham's faith in response to God's promise that he would
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.400]   have an heir from his own 100-year-old body and from Sarah's 90-year-old barren body.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.240]   One, he says, the presence of God in whom he believed.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.040]   Two, in hope he believed against hope.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.840]   Three, he did not weaken in faith.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.320]   Four, he did not doubt in unbelief.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.840]   Five, he was strengthened in faith.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.240]   Six, he was fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   That's amazing.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.960]   That is really clear, right?
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.640]   You know what Paul thinks anyway about Abraham's faith from Genesis 17.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.280]   Now here's an interesting possible confirmation before we turn to the Old Testament context
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.440]   for a minute.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.880]   Here's an interesting confirmation from Jesus.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:01.600]   In John 8, 56, Jesus says to the Jewish leaders, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.080]   day.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.360]   He saw it and was glad."
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:18.640]   What does gladness refer to when Jesus says Abraham saw the day of Christ and was glad?
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.400]   Would it be the laughter of Genesis 17, 17?
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:35.400]   God gave Abraham a glimpse of Christ in the sense that Genesis 17, 1 to 19 says repeatedly
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:44.840]   six times that Abraham would have offspring of his own who would be the heir of the promise.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.880]   And we know that Paul in Galatians saw that offspring as Christ.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:57.640]   So I just can't help but wonder when Jesus said, "He saw my day and was glad," he
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:05.560]   might have had in mind, "He saw my day in the promises of Genesis 17 and he laughed
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.440]   aloud with gladness."
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.440]   Well, I can't prove that.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:18.840]   But what is clear is that Paul sees Abraham's faith as strong and exemplary for us, even
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.520]   though not perfect.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.320]   So here's the question.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.760]   Whether the clues in Genesis are sufficient to say, "Paul got this right."
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.560]   I mean, that's what Jessica is asking, because when she reads verse 17 of Genesis 17, it
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.360]   sounds to her like Abraham is just blowing it off, like he's laughing it out of court.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:46.000]   That can't be, which sounds like a wavering of faith, a weakening, a doubting of faith.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.480]   So let me just give a list of clues that I think Paul got it right.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.400]   In other words, if I ask myself, "What did Paul see?" in the context, this is what
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.800]   I think he saw.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:05.760]   In Genesis 15, 6, Abraham looked at the stars, listened to God, and believed the promise
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.760]   that his descendants would be like that.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.760]   He said so.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.760]   He believed God, and God counted it to him as righteousness.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:18.280]   Second, Abraham asks God what evidence God would give him that the covenant would be
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.280]   kept.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:25.600]   And amazingly, in Genesis 15, 18, God acts out a kind of covenant ceremony in which animals
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:32.360]   are cut in half, and God passes between them as if to say, "May I be cut in pieces if
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.720]   I don't keep my half of this covenant to make your seed nations."
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:47.680]   Third, God renews the promise in Genesis 17, 4 that Abraham would father many nations,
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:54.160]   and he changes Abraham's name from Abram to Abraham to show how certain this is.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.080]   This is as good as done.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.840]   You have a name, and Abraham embraces that.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.640]   And then fourth, in verse 17, it doesn't just say that Abraham laughed.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.800]   This is really significant, I think.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   It says, "He fell on his face."
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.680]   It already said that once in verse 3.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.120]   "He fell on his face and laughed."
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.800]   And falling on your face before Yahweh is a sign of reverence and respect and awe and
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   fear.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:30.360]   It's not the posture you would assume if you were cynically laughing off the possibility
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.520]   of what God just said.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:43.320]   And fifth, finally, as soon as the encounter with God is over in chapter 17, Abraham immediately
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.920]   obeys the terms of the covenant and has all the males circumcised.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:55.320]   So it seems to me that we have good reason not only from the New Testament but also from
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.040]   the context of the Old Testament that Abraham's faith really was astonishing.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:09.520]   And when Paul said in Romans 4.20 that Abraham was strengthened—passive voice, strengthened
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:16.040]   in his faith, giving glory to God—that passive voice is intended to draw our attention to
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:23.920]   the fact that this amazing work of faith in Abraham was not just his doing.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.880]   It was the work of God in him.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.840]   And that probably is the central lesson for us.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:39.520]   Paul is trying to make clear that sinners like us come into a right relationship with
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:47.160]   God by trusting him, believing, having faith, not by working for him.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:55.880]   And even more pointedly, Paul is showing us that this faith itself is a work of God so
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:05.200]   that in the end God gets all the glory, not just because of our faith calling attention
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:13.480]   to his total trustworthiness and all sufficiency, but also because the faith itself is a mighty
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.400]   work of God.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.640]   Well, tell us if it was one of your trees.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   That was our tree.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.640]   Oh my.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.240]   Oh, that's like losing a loved one.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.320]   How old is that tree?
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.480]   It was there since we moved in here 40 years ago.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.240]   And it must have been diseased.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.640]   I saw a green X on it and I thought, "Oh no, no, they've taken it down.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.440]   It had a lot of dead branches in it.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.960]   That means all my shade in the afternoon is going to disappear and I will leave a legacy
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.960]   with a small tree."
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.960]   Oh man.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.840]   Well, I think your legacy will be more than a sap link, but that's still sap.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.600]   Well, that's a bummer way to end today's episode, but that's how it's going to end.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.080]   Thank you for listening to this unexpectedly interrupted episode.
