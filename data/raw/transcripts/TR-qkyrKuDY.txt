[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:38.460]   - Hello?
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.460]   Oh, there we go.
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.460]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.460]   As a introductory note,
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.460]   would like everybody to know
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.460]   that we did remove the two front rows
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.460]   so that when we, after the time of singing praise,
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.460]   if you'd like to come up and kneel to pray,
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.460]   you can fill the front area as you please,
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.460]   and if there's no room,
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.460]   you can just come up right up to the stairs as well.
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.460]   As an additional note,
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.460]   not as any kind of requirement,
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.460]   but as a suggestion,
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.460]   I do suggest you to pray audibly,
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.460]   meaning articulate your words.
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.460]   That's not to say that God does not hear your silent prayers
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.460]   or that he does not know your mind,
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.460]   but although God knows your heart and every need,
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.460]   he desires you to ask,
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.460]   and if we're gonna confess,
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.460]   then we should confess with our mouths,
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.460]   and what's more,
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.460]   in the same way that we sing with passion,
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.460]   we should be praying with passion as well,
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.460]   and so again, not as a requirement
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.460]   or not trying to make you do something
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.460]   you're not accustomed to,
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.460]   but my guess is it's difficult to concentrate
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.460]   and focus in silence for 30 minutes,
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.460]   but it actually takes that much more concentration
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.460]   and focus to put into words
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.460]   all that we're thinking, feeling, and desiring
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.460]   for God to hear, amen?
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.460]   So would you join with me now in a word of prayer
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.460]   as we begin service with time of praise?
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.460]   Let's pray.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.460]   Our Heavenly Father,
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.460]   we thank you so much, God.
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.460]   Although we are undeserving,
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.460]   to know that you, as the God of the universe,
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.460]   you hear our every individual prayer.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.460]   It's astounding.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.460]   We know, Father God,
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.460]   that you bestow on us your love,
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.460]   you give to us mercy every single day in Christ.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.460]   Thank you, God, that you hear us,
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.460]   and I ask, Father Lord,
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.460]   that we would then have such a sense of privilege,
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.460]   we would have the sense of gratitude,
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.460]   we would be always in wonder and amazement
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.460]   and at all of the kind of care that you show us,
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.460]   and we pray, God, that as we join together,
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.460]   uniting our voices to sing to you,
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.460]   to pray to you,
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.460]   Lord God, this would be a blessed time.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.460]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.460]   Church family, let's all stand together
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.460]   as we come before God in worship.

[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.460]   about such a common problem that it feels like
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.460]   we can have an amazing week in the Lord
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.460]   and just fall into it the day after.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.460]   And I am talking about the problem of apathy.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.460]   You know, when we think about our hearts,
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.460]   sometimes because there are circumstances and situations
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.460]   where we're just fatigued,
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.460]   or actually when we think about the things of God
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.460]   like Sunday worship, Bible study, and even prayer meetings,
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.460]   there is the problem of repetitiveness, redundancy,
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.460]   or something that seems so routine.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.460]   But we recognize that upon examination of our hearts,
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.460]   and we need to do it often,
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.460]   the problem isn't that we have the same thing
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.460]   every week or every month.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.460]   Because we're gonna come into worship every week.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.460]   Because even when we think about our prayer meetings,
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.460]   are we not gonna pray over the same things
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.460]   that we've prayed over before?
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.460]   We're gonna be praying over our sins and confessing them.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.460]   We're gonna be praying over the topics that people share.
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.460]   We're gonna be praying over the things that we struggle with
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.460]   and the needs of the church, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.460]   And so I wanna give just a first encouragement
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.460]   that we have to center our minds
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.460]   on fighting this common problem that happens so regularly,
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.460]   even aside from the fact that yes,
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.460]   we are participating in things that we commonly always do.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:26.460]   The scripture says in Isaiah chapter 29, verse 13,
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.460]   "Then the Lord said, 'Because these people draw near me
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.460]   "with their words and honor me with their lip service,
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.460]   "but they remove their hearts far from me,
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.460]   "and their reverence for me consists of tradition
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.460]   "learned by rote.'"
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.460]   We're familiar with this because Jesus quoted it himself,
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:49.460]   that God is incredibly, for lack of better words,
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.460]   annoyed, is distasteful,
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.460]   when there is just simply lip service.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:00.460]   God is not accepting of just ritualistic traditions.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.460]   It is not okay if we just simply show up on time
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.460]   because it's time.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.460]   It's time to worship, it's time to pray.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.460]   So my challenge tonight is going to be let us pray
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.460]   that things like this we have the proper attitude.
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.460]   Let's pray that we don't grow tired or worrisome
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.460]   of services or times like this,
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.460]   but rather we see it as an attitude
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.460]   of true, unique privilege, amen?
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.460]   This is for me.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.460]   Let's have that kind of attitude.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.460]   And I wanna put up a couple of prayer points,
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.460]   things to put off and things to put on for us.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.460]   We wanna take time to examine,
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.460]   we wanna take time to evaluate,
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.460]   are there certain thoughts or attitudes in my heart
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:50.460]   so that we guard against any kind of apathy that is growing?
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.460]   First and foremost, as you would commonly suspect,
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:58.460]   the greatest source of apathy is undelt sin.
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.460]   So as in previous maybe times of coming together to pray,
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.460]   I wanna ask, are there sins by which we have not confessed,
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.460]   either past or present, or even if it feels like,
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.460]   well the moment has passed, it's already been two weeks,
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.460]   whatever it may be, if somewhere in your mind
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.460]   you thought of your sin as it's just a bruise
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.460]   and I'm gonna heal, you're deceived.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.460]   It leaves God completely out of the picture.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.460]   Let's take time to confess.
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.460]   Why?
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:31.460]   Because any unconfessed sin causes us to be careless.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.460]   You recall back in the Old Testament
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.460]   that when an individual thought, you know what?
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.460]   I know this lamb is blemished, the lamb is blind,
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.460]   the lamb is this, but let's just offer it up.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.460]   He'll take whatever we give.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:49.460]   That kind of carelessness is indicative of apathy.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.460]   What's more, I ask you this question.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.460]   By chance do you come tonight with a level of disappointment?
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.460]   With a level of no expectation?
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.460]   I come, I pray, nothing happened last time.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.460]   What's the use?
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.460]   A level of discouragement.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:12.460]   A level of kind of like almost there to quit mentality.
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.460]   Pray for perseverance.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.460]   Pray for a heart that's willing to wait on the Lord.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.460]   And then there's this question of is there any part of you
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.460]   that is no longer, or in this time,
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.460]   amazed at the incredible grace God has given you?
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.460]   Is there a level of thanklessness in you?
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:34.460]   Please take time now just to think about where your heart is
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.460]   if any part of you have come into this place
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.460]   with a sense of apathy.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.460]   I'm gonna give you some time to privately pray.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.460]   Let me lead us by saying a quick word.
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.460]   Let's pray.
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:53.460]   Father God, you have taught the people from long ago
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:59.460]   not to come into your presence completely burdened to come,
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.460]   but rather, God, with amazement, with thoughts of you.
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.460]   I pray, Father God, that as we have joined together,
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:13.460]   let our hearts rise to you and do a spiritual work in us, God,
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.460]   that you would challenge us to fight, to guard our hearts
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.460]   against all forms of apathy.
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.460]   We pray now, God, you would hear our prayers. Amen.

[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.460]   if anybody would like to come up to kneel and pray,
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.460]   please go ahead and do that now for the next five minutes.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.460]   Again, the topics that are right behind me,
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.460]   please go ahead and pray over the things that we need to put off,
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.460]   the questions to examine our hearts,
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.460]   and then in about five minutes, we'll continue on with more worship.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.460]   Thank you.

[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:29.940]   ♪ As a pleasing sacrifice ♪
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:35.740]   ♪ Lord, I offer you my life ♪
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:49.520]   - Okay, continuing on with just the thought
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.060]   of guarding our hearts against any kind of apathy.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:58.100]   We know that should we lose sight of why, purpose,
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.400]   or meaning behind whatever we're doing,
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.600]   we can't stay motivated.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.120]   And so, if our hearts are growing apathetic,
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.700]   there's this question.
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.940]   The grand purposes of God for his kingdom,
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.200]   the joy of God's heart for salvation,
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.120]   we have to pray for that.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.160]   If there is any kind of apathy in your heart
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.800]   where you feel like kind of frustrated
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.760]   because you are doing technically all the right things,
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.920]   all the expected things, the Bible study,
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.480]   the sharing, the discussion questions, all of that,
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.600]   let's pray for this.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.160]   On the screen, we're gonna put up
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.560]   a couple more prayer topics.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.040]   First, the passage from Matthew.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.180]   Jesus said, "What do you think?
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.860]   "If any man has a hundred sheep
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.940]   "and one of them has gone astray,
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.280]   "does he not leave the 99 on the mountains
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.140]   "and go in search for the one that is strained?
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:51.280]   "If it turns out that he finds it,
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.580]   "truly I say to you, he rejoices over it
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.920]   "more than over the 99 which have gone astray.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:02.460]   "So is it not the will of your Father who is in heaven
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.660]   "that one of these little ones perishes?"
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.600]   So, in highlighting this passage,
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.320]   Jesus is talking not about a strategy,
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.440]   but just simply the joy of God's heart
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.360]   in seeing one lost sheep coming to salvation.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.980]   So, let's pray.
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.680]   Let's pray that our hearts are enlargened,
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.560]   our spiritual sight is just blown away
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.000]   by the incredible heart of God,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.960]   and that our heart then would be in accordance with his
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.960]   for the grand kingdom that he is building.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.940]   And so now, also, let's pray all the names
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.220]   that come to your mind of loved ones,
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.880]   all the individuals in your immediate vicinity,
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.800]   the people that you come across
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.680]   who need to hear the message,
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.200]   who have heard or perhaps aren't coming around.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.080]   Let's lift them up in prayer at this time.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.840]   Please go ahead and go right into it,
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.040]   and I'll come back to give the next segment.

[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:10.580]   (gentle piano music)
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:17.580]   - Allow me to pray to close off that topic.
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.580]   Heavenly Father, we sang together
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.580]   that you would use everything in our lives.
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:29.580]   And so Father, we pray that at our church, God,
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.580]   we're so blessed with equipping and preaching.
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.580]   Use it, Lord, for your glory.
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:37.580]   Lord God, we're blessed with fellowship, community.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:39.580]   Use that, Lord God, for your glory.
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:42.580]   And Lord, everything then we have in life,
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.580]   all the resources you've blessed us with,
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.580]   use that for your glory.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:49.580]   As we take time to think, Lord God,
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.580]   that our church has hundreds of kids.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:55.580]   Use us, Father God, to show them faith
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:59.580]   and the love of the Lord Jesus that conquers everything.
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:03.580]   And I pray, Father God, we would have eyes to see,
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.580]   not just cute kids, precious kids,
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:09.580]   not just individuals who are attendants and new visitors,
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.580]   but God, help us to see with spiritual eyes,
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.580]   as you do, Lord, that we would see the lost
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.580]   and their desperate need.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.580]   But Lord God, then that we would be convicted and moved
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.580]   to do everything in our power to show them
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.580]   the glory of Christ.
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.580]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:31.580]   As we think about guarding our hearts against apathy,
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:35.580]   you know, one of the greatest just lines
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.580]   of biblical counseling is just simply this,
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.580]   what do you want?
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:43.580]   The moment we are apathetic about the Lord Jesus
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:46.580]   is because foolishly we want something else.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.580]   And God had given us this warning in the scriptures
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:53.580]   in Matthew chapter six, verse 20, it says,
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:58.580]   "But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.580]   "where neither moth nor rust destroys
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:04.580]   "and where thieves do not break in or steal.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:08.580]   "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:11.580]   Jesus taught us this treasure principle.
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.580]   In as much as we're staring at the building of the account,
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.580]   in as much as we have hope of collecting and collecting,
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:20.580]   and the more that we have our investment,
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.580]   and the more that we admire that investment,
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.580]   there our heart will be.
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:29.580]   And so, what is it that we want?
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:34.580]   What is it that we're staring at that we admire so much?
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.580]   What are some of these treasures?
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:40.580]   Another way to put it, A.W. Tozer said in a book,
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:44.580]   he says, "There is this principle also of being impressed.
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.580]   "The way Satan gets us to be apathetic
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:51.580]   "is to simply impress us with all the lesser things of life."
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:56.580]   So, the exact same thing stated another way is,
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.580]   what are you impressed with?
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:02.580]   Are you so impressed with the things shown on YouTube?
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:06.580]   So impressed with people's, whatever it may be,
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:09.580]   their homes, their makeovers, their this and that,
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:11.580]   how they do things, their sports,
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:13.580]   their performances, their songs.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:17.580]   Are we so apathetic because we're so impressed
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:19.580]   with all the wrong things?
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:23.580]   So, as we put up the next set of prayer topics
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:24.580]   and the passage there,
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:28.580]   please pray with these evaluation questions,
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:32.580]   and if you brought your notebook or something to write on,
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:35.580]   this is the time to get real specific.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:38.580]   What is it in your heart that's a precious treasure?
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.580]   You feel at an incredible loss if you don't have it.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.580]   What are your personal ambitions
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:48.580]   to such a degree where you've been planning,
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.580]   you've been researching,
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:51.580]   you've been giving all of your attention
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.580]   to that particular thing?
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.580]   What are you coveting in other people
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:55.580]   where you're so impressed
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:58.580]   because the people that you feel like have made it
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.580]   or have succeeded
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.580]   are the people who have actually fulfilled your ambitions?
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.580]   If that's you, as you evaluate,
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.580]   let's pray for humility.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.580]   Let's pray in actual submission to say,
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:14.580]   "Lord, rather than asking you to rip this out of my hand,
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:15.580]   "here it is first.
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.580]   "I volitionally surrender it to you."
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:20.580]   Are there any areas where you lack trust?
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.580]   You're just in fear,
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:23.580]   particularly if you're parents,
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:26.580]   you're afraid your children will not be happy,
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.580]   your children will not be as educated,
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.580]   your children will fall behind.
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.580]   Are there any areas where you're lacking trust
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:34.580]   in your own personal arenas?
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.580]   In your own advancement?
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:39.580]   In your own happiness?
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:44.580]   In these things, please take time as you pray
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.580]   to get very specific.
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.580]   Sometimes we raise questions like this
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:49.580]   and it's so broad.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.580]   Basically, I can summarize it,
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.580]   "What are you struggling with?"
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.580]   But this is the time to get really specific with God
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.580]   and say, "God, I trust you with my salvation.
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.580]   "I trust you with everything else
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.580]   "but here in this arena,
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.580]   "I have a hard time trusting you."
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:11.580]   Be honest, be confessional, be candid.
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:13.580]   Are you distracted?
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:16.580]   As again, I brought up how A.W. Tozer put it,
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:19.580]   "Are you distracted and impressed by the world?"
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.580]   Let's pray.
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:23.580]   Let's pray as King David did when he said to God,
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:27.580]   "I will put no unworthy or worthless thing
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.580]   "before my eyes."
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.580]   That is your choice.
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:32.580]   That's your action.
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:33.580]   That's your decision.
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.580]   What will you put before your face?
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:39.580]   What will you enjoy and pass the time?
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.580]   But rather, let's pray for a great, great vision
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.580]   before the Lord that we would have
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:45.580]   an ongoing meditation
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.580]   and growing knowledge of our Lord Jesus.
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.580]   Please go ahead and take those topics and pray.

[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:27.580]   - In our last segment of our prayer time,
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:29.580]   after I explain the topics,
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:32.580]   I will break you guys up into the three,
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:35.580]   or you can just pray if you're here with your family.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.580]   But we have a lot of stuff going on,
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.580]   but these are just some highlights
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.580]   of some corporate prayer topics.
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:44.580]   One, as you guys know, the college ministry,
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:45.580]   their summer is wrapping up,
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.580]   and they have already been gearing up
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.580]   for the ministry on campus,
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.580]   getting ready for the influx of new students,
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:55.580]   and this year they're going to different campuses as well.
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.580]   So let's really pray for,
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.580]   at the start of the calendar academic year
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.580]   for effective ministry,
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.580]   let's pray that those opportunities
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.580]   to engage the students are really fruitful.
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.580]   They have planned various events
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.580]   from welcome lunches, et cetera.
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:13.580]   So let's pray that all of those will be effective.
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:18.580]   Secondly, as each period goes by,
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.580]   we do hear of a lot of individuals
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.580]   where they're either learning that
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:26.580]   beloved family members are either sick severely.
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:29.580]   We sometimes hear that there are passing of loved ones,
[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:32.580]   whether it's grandparents or even father, mother.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:35.580]   If you are aware, in the little pod,
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:36.580]   you can bring it up and pray,
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:40.580]   but also we would request one prayer for Elder James.
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:42.580]   So as you guys know, Diane was pregnant,
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.580]   but she suffered from preeclampsia,
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:48.580]   and when she went in on emergency notice,
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:50.580]   soon after she had to deliver,
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.580]   but the baby was only 26 weeks.
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.580]   So that's roughly three months early.
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:58.580]   So let's pray for health both for Diane and the baby.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.580]   The baby's name is Clement.
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:03.580]   Because the baby is so young and so small,
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:06.580]   there is still like a worry for complication.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.580]   Sometimes there are breathing complications
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.580]   and various difficulty.
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:12.580]   So let's really lift them up to the Lord.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:15.580]   Finally, the Taiwan missions team,
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.580]   we've been meeting this month.
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:21.580]   We have our next training and meeting just in a week or two.
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:23.580]   As the team goes out in October,
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.580]   please pray that it will be a successful trip
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:29.580]   where we can have divinely appointed opportunities
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:32.580]   to meet and converse with the people there.
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.580]   We will be primarily working with college students.
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.580]   Just about every day we'll be on campus,
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:42.580]   either doing a cultural exchange, English corner,
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:45.580]   discussion time, tours of the campus,
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:47.580]   tours of classrooms,
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.580]   and then we've also planned a time to whoever we meet
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:51.580]   to have an all-day activity.
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:54.580]   We're going and doing a hike and a long walk together.
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:58.580]   So let's really pray that God will prepare our hearts as a team,
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:01.580]   prepare hearts of the people that we'll talk to,
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:05.580]   and have a really fruitful time of ministry out there.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:09.580]   So I'm going to go ahead and request that you guys look around,
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:11.580]   take initiative to get into pockets of three.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:12.580]   We'll pray over these things
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:14.580]   and then close off with a closing song.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:15.580]   Thank you.

[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:25.580]   - Let's pray together.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:29.580]   Father God, we do want to, with all of our hearts, thank you.
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.580]   God, thank you that you are the one
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.580]   washing us with your word,
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:36.580]   challenging us to mature and grow.
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:38.580]   I thank you, God, with your fatherly love,
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:41.580]   your putting away the things that are ignoble
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:45.580]   and causing us to be all the more conformed to your son.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:47.580]   And it is our prayer that you will cause us to mature
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:51.580]   in both our mind, the conviction, Lord God,
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:53.580]   of the principles of scripture,
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:56.580]   but also, Lord, maturing our hearts,
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:59.580]   that we will be passionate about the right things,
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:01.580]   that, God, we would never be apathetic
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:03.580]   about the kingdom of the Lord
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:05.580]   or the things that have to do with Christ,
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:08.580]   but rather we will grow, we'll grow in faith and love.
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:10.580]   We thank you, God, this day that you heard our prayers.
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:13.580]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:14.580]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:17.580]   As a final couple announcements, number one,
[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:21.580]   the shuttle service to the far lots will be going,
[01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:23.580]   but will stop at 9.30,
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:25.580]   so after you have time of fellowship,
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:28.580]   please make sure you make your way out to the lot.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:33.580]   Also, we need your help to reset our sanctuary back for service.
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:35.580]   Please help us roll away the carpet
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:39.580]   to that side of the sanctuary for the storage,
[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:41.580]   and please do help us on either side.
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:43.580]   We have brown chairs that we need to reset
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:44.580]   and put the tables back in.
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:46.580]   Thank you so much.
