[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hello, everyone.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.240]   We're back studying the book of Ephesians.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.360]   Today, we're gonna be talking about some practical matters
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.120]   and some instructions for the home.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.120]   Let's take a moment to pray before we jump into the study.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.880]   Lord, we thank you for your grace again,
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.520]   and we do pray that as you give to us
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.960]   your instruction and your word,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.080]   help us, Father God, to have the wisdom
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.200]   to see how to apply.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.120]   And what's more, help us to have courage and strength.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.160]   And Father God, help us to also think biblically,
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.880]   to see, Father Lord, that this fruit of obedience to you
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.840]   far exceeds any kind of fruit this world has to offer.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.840]   We thank you, Lord, and pray for a fruitful time of study.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.640]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.880]   Okay, today we're looking at Ephesians chapter five,
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.240]   verse 22.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.640]   I'm gonna read all the way down to verse 33,
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.200]   as it is one cohesive section.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.360]   So let's take a moment to read this together.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.040]   And it says, "Be subject,"
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.720]   oh, sorry, I'm starting from verse 21.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.400]   "And be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.040]   "Wise, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.420]   "For the husband is the head of the wife,
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.920]   "as Christ also is the head of the church,
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.520]   "he himself being the savior of the body.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.160]   "But as a church is subject to Christ,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.400]   "so also the wives ought to be
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.460]   "to their husbands in everything.
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.920]   "Furthermore, husbands, love your wives
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.160]   "just as Christ also loved the church
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.080]   "and gave himself up for her,
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.120]   "so that he might sanctify her,
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.140]   "having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.240]   "that he might present to himself the church
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.200]   "in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.600]   "or any such thing,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.340]   "but that she would be holy and blameless.
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.820]   "So husbands ought also to love their own wives
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.280]   "as their own bodies.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   "He who loves his own wife loves himself,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.220]   "for no one ever hated his own flesh,
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.080]   "but nourishes and cherishes it,
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.400]   "just as Christ also does the church,
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.040]   "because we are members of his body.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.380]   "For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.380]   "and shall be joined to his wife,
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.000]   "and the two shall become one flesh.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.220]   "This mystery is great,
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.640]   "but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.760]   "Nevertheless, each individual among you
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.500]   "also is to love his own wife, even as himself,
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.600]   "and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband."
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.680]   Now, by way of just review in that previous paragraph,
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.360]   recall that the challenge for the church
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.320]   was to walk carefully and to walk in wisdom, okay?
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.600]   To put aside the kind of foolishness
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.460]   that exists in the world.
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.040]   At the end of that paragraph, he commanded,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.040]   "Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ."
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.760]   So if you link the two ideas, it is a wisdom of God.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.480]   It reflects our wisdom to be able to think like Christ,
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.760]   to think with the realities
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.840]   that God has given us in the spirit,
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.200]   to be able to subject ourselves to one another.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.700]   And as you think about that,
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.980]   it totally makes sense that within the gospel
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.360]   and our understanding of Jesus Christ,
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.880]   a huge exhortation is to be able
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.100]   to love sacrificially like Christ,
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.100]   where we are willing to mitigate
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.080]   our own rights and preferences,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.820]   where we are willing to reduce or to put down
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.720]   and subject our own importance
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.180]   for the sake of somebody else, okay?
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.140]   And then if you think about it for a moment,
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.320]   this applies in so many other areas of life.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.780]   Where else are we challenged
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.860]   to practice submission to one another?
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.140]   Well, if you think about it, obviously in the military,
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.860]   clear ranking order, in government, it's your workplace.
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.640]   What's more, even in school or classrooms,
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.480]   there is need for authority and submission.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.500]   What's more, even in communities, in society,
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.680]   in essentially relationships that we have
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.260]   amongst neighbors or even friends,
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.820]   one might think you're supposed to be completely equal.
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.540]   Well, actually, if you look at most friendships,
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.420]   a lot of friendships end up looking like siblings,
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.300]   where you have an individual who is maybe
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.780]   like providing care, exhorting, encouraging.
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.100]   And what's more, even in communities,
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.060]   you have community leaders.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.280]   I mean, I think that's kind of funny,
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.340]   but even in the ideas of games and leisure,
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.980]   you realize that sometimes in leisure,
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.060]   there are things like dance classes and you have instructors
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.820]   and when you think about which classes are the best,
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.540]   and typically the classes that are the best
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.460]   are the classes where the instructors are good,
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.580]   where the individual who is teaching,
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.500]   the individual who's guiding, when that person is capable,
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.080]   is able to control the classroom,
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.280]   is able to direct for the purpose of you learning,
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.820]   those are actually the most enjoyable times.
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.620]   You even think about church
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.100]   and the scripture challenges the believers
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.740]   to submit to the elders of the church,
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.540]   that there will be order in the church,
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.260]   that there will be also this thought,
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.940]   like if you think about how to conduct oneself
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.460]   in the household of God, in the book of Titus,
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.820]   it says actually the younger men
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.500]   should be respectful to the older,
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.340]   that the older ladies should be instructing
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.440]   and setting an example for the younger.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.160]   There is so much in terms of submission,
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.180]   there is so much in terms of authority,
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.820]   so much in terms of seeing this kind of,
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.620]   what sounds like almost a bad word, hierarchy.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.940]   And we realize that no, that's not a bad term,
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.900]   but actually embedded into the design of God,
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.420]   such things exist, authority and submission.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.300]   More so here in this passage specifically,
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.620]   we realize it also applies
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.780]   to the home between husband and wife.
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.980]   Now the problem is that sin tends to pervert
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.220]   and ruin these relationships.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.660]   It ruins the relationships amongst teachers and students
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.340]   in the home between husband and wife, parent and child.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.460]   Sin tends to pervert things.
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.700]   Sin takes something that's good, like authority,
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.300]   where you need authority in order to make sure
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.260]   that you are instructing well,
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.660]   to guide and to protect sometimes even from oneself.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.740]   But then that authority is perverted to selfishness,
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.200]   competition, greed, abuse.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.060]   Sometimes our sins causes these relationships
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.180]   to be completely loveless and authority is practiced
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.260]   where we essentially simply subjecting people
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.140]   without any care or consideration of the individuals.
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.580]   So we realize again, that a massive hindrance
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.300]   to the idea of authority and submission
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.220]   is because it a lot of times goes sour.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.140]   We're afraid that authority will be abused
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.860]   and that we won't be loved.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.660]   And Satan seeks to pervert the design of God
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.300]   and especially ruin the home.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.860]   Satan desires to essentially tell us otherwise,
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.780]   that no, the design of God is actually unholy.
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.520]   You need to fend for yourself.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.620]   You need more freedom.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.580]   You need more safety.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.620]   You need more protection.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.540]   You need more liberating.
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.600]   Forget the family, right?
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   That I believe is the kind of thought and concepts
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.100]   that Satan would love to have.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.140]   But rather we want to make sure that we abide
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.220]   by scripture's expectations of the home.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.820]   That the home is a place where God has designed
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.220]   for there to be great holiness.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.540]   That there are supposed to be great levels of joy,
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.580]   family unity, things like trust, intimacy and harmony
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.740]   and levels of love between husband and wife,
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.940]   parent and children.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.340]   But all of that comes with great responsibility
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.700]   and self-sacrifice.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.740]   All that comes from deep commitment and high risk.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.140]   And so scripture typically tells us
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.220]   that the context by we're supposed to be practicing
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.700]   these things is in the context of God's design.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.540]   And so if there is an area where in connection
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.580]   with the previous passage in the previous paragraph,
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.700]   the connection in the previous paragraph said walk wisely,
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.880]   we need to be all the more careful
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.480]   to know the instruction of God and walk wisely in the home.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.400]   And I'm very much convicted by that just from the get-go.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.960]   Because truthfully speaking, what is sometimes very common
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.400]   is that where we are comfortable
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.260]   is that in the home, we're actually the most careless.
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.440]   Typically in the home, we're very careless with our words.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.880]   And scripture actually predicted this by saying,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.840]   where there is familiarity, there's contempt.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.560]   And even with Jesus, when he was in his hometown, he said,
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.840]   "The prophet has no welcome in his hometown."
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.240]   Because they just assumed, "We know this person.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.520]   "This child is the son of who?"
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.940]   But if you think about it actually, God says,
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.720]   "No, especially in the home,
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.640]   "God has given very clear instructions
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.060]   "and we are to make sure we walk carefully
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.820]   "and wisely in them."
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.400]   The very first point I wanna think about
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.000]   is actually the context of the commands that are to come.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.200]   What do I mean?
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.480]   Well, I would like to have you think about the idea
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.160]   of the commandment then, the commandment now,
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.560]   and God's design.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.400]   The commandment then and the commandment now
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.340]   and God's design.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.180]   Why?
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.760]   Because we understand actually that these commands
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.480]   that we read, where it called upon the wives
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.760]   to be submissive to their husbands,
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.760]   this was given at a time when the sentiment towards women
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.240]   was so ungodly.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.520]   Rather than seeing women as a fellow image bearer,
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.320]   men or women, fellow image bearer,
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.960]   that we are both heirs of Christ if we're Christian.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.840]   Within the era, there was so much abuse and neglect.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.320]   What's more specifically to the Church of Ephesus,
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.160]   whether it was the Turkish area or the Greek area
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.680]   or the Roman era, there was such abuse.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.200]   History has it that there was so much
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.320]   of a measure of corruption
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.840]   and there was so much oppression towards those who were weak.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.640]   And Scripture, and not only Scripture,
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.080]   but also outside history records the fact.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.640]   And I'll just briefly mention that at that time,
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.560]   there was such a practice where essentially people would pray
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.900]   and thank the gods that they were not slaves or women.
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.640]   In ancient Greek society,
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.960]   there were so many vices in the world,
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.320]   such as the practice of having many concubines
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.840]   or the practice of going to the temple idol,
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.800]   temple worship and hiring prostitutes
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.920]   for their sexual pleasure.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.440]   And so a lot of Greek men found no reason
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.000]   to divorce their wives.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.840]   Why?
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.440]   It was no pain to them to just have them around.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.520]   Their wives were simply there to bear legitimate children
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.640]   to keep the lineage going.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.320]   And so when males, when the men felt the need
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.920]   for sexual gratification, they would turn to prostitution.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.960]   They would turn to sexual promiscuity
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.560]   and all kinds of immorality were rampant in the day.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.160]   To that era, this command was given,
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.400]   love your husbands and submit to them.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.800]   Which is very, it's just kind of,
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.800]   we have to think and understand
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.000]   that the command of God then nevertheless
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.760]   is still the same.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.940]   This command applies then and this command applies now.
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.840]   Perhaps we may feel that now it's controversial
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.600]   because now things have changed,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   because now there's more legal protection.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.800]   Now women are not seen as property.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.560]   They're protected by the law and successful economically.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.560]   But does that mean then
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.700]   that God's commandments have changed?
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.860]   Actually, I would argue that that commandment
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.580]   probably was harder to swallow at that time than now.
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.420]   Right?
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.340]   That's what I would think.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.300]   What's really interesting is throughout time,
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:32.300]   God has always wanted more than political
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.780]   and I guess more than social change.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.540]   He wanted marriages to be Christ-like and holy and godly.
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.500]   God did not just vie for legal change,
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.980]   but he wanted a growth of God likeness
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.380]   for children of light to behave like children of light,
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.420]   most importantly, within the home.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.900]   God desired the marriage relationship
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.820]   to be holy and permanent, like his own character and love.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.340]   God's desire that marriage look radically different
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.180]   from the culture and the generation.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.820]   And so what's really interesting is that in God's design,
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.380]   the concepts of love, authority, submission has no conflict.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.940]   It doesn't just simply conflict internally,
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.820]   but it's supposed to actually conflict
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.780]   with the entire generation and age.
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.380]   So as we think about this,
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.180]   I just want to highlight the fact that
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.540]   the kind of love marriage relationship that God has designed
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.780]   where there is supposed to be such a humility,
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.420]   such a Christ-likeness, such a selfless purpose
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.420]   to not come to be served, but to serve,
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.140]   that is all possible only in Christ.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.180]   And so I'll take a moment to give one of those quick advice,
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.220]   particularly for the ladies,
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.340]   since we're talking about ladies,
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.860]   especially right now, if you're single, please listen up.
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.980]   This design of God where love, authority, and submission
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.060]   somehow stands in perfect harmony
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.700]   and accomplishes God's design,
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.020]   we're saying this is only possible in Christ.
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.900]   And so when you are thinking about dating
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.980]   and getting involved in a romantic relationship,
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.780]   do not settle for somebody who is just Christian by name.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.900]   Why?
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.700]   Because the kind of love that is beautiful, holy,
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.380]   and Christ-like will not be possible.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.220]   And already in a vulnerable position
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.220]   as a woman who is called to be submissive,
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.420]   you will cause yourself to not only be vulnerable,
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.500]   but to perhaps endure great pains.
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.620]   I want to advise you, make sure he understands
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.100]   and knows the love of God in such a way
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.100]   that he has beheld the holy, holy love of God
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.620]   that has descended to reach
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.980]   a pitiful, wretched sinner like us,
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:52.860]   and he is just genuinely broken by the mercies of God.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.180]   That's the kind of guy that you want,
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.820]   the guy who's seen the incredible love of God.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.380]   Only then can he practice it.
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.780]   All right, moving on.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.980]   In this passage, we see the clear command to the wives,
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.260]   and the command is this.
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.260]   Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.340]   Later on down the line,
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.060]   he talks about how this mystery is great,
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.420]   but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.820]   Nevertheless, each individual among you
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.740]   also is to love his own wife, even as himself,
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.460]   and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.020]   So I want to highlight for you
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.940]   the two commands that is given within this paragraph,
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.020]   verses 21 through 33.
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.580]   And the two commandments are that you be subject
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.900]   to your own husbands as to the Lord,
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.020]   and that the wife must see to it
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.220]   that she respects her husband.
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.860]   Giving you a little bit of an outline of the passage,
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.740]   those two commandments are emphatic,
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.580]   and then the rest of the section that we're looking at
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.180]   gives you the rationale for the husband
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.660]   is the head of the wife.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.500]   And then it gives you the model,
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.700]   but as the church is subject to Christ.
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.860]   So it gives you the rationale and the model
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.100]   in verse 23 and 24.
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.020]   Let's take a look at these two commands,
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.780]   be subject and be respectful.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.060]   First, when we think about be subject,
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.460]   again, this term, be subject,
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.260]   is a connection to the previous command in verse 21
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.820]   that says be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.100]   And that term most frequently is used
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.860]   in the military context.
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.700]   That term means to place under, okay?
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.020]   To place under.
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.140]   This is the idea of being submissive.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.260]   And because it is used frequently in the military context,
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.700]   it is thinking about arranging individuals
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.780]   in terms of rank, okay?
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.300]   And I just like to put it into simplistic terms.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.620]   I mean, we could sit and think deeply and meditate
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.700]   about what does submission mean?
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.660]   What does submission mean, right?
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.180]   But essentially when Jesus says,
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.860]   "Not my will, but yours," that's submission.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.420]   I'm not gonna lead, you lead.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.900]   That's submission, right?
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.940]   And so that, in terms of a kind of simplistic definition,
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.460]   you have it there.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.260]   Also, in tandem with that, the passage says to respect.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.260]   And the concept of respect is the word phobia, right?
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.780]   Which where we get that, like the Latin terms
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.900]   and the English word phobia, which means to fear.
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.420]   The most frequent or most commonly used translation
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.620]   of this term is fear, but in context of certain things
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.860]   like fearing of the Lord, fearing of people,
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.260]   we get the ideas of reverence, respect, and honor, okay?
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.620]   There are some cross-references
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.460]   I would like to highlight for you.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.980]   And the first cross-reference comes
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.700]   from Colossians 3, 18 through 19.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.900]   This passage says, "Wives, be subject to your husbands
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.340]   "as is fitting in the Lord.
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.400]   "Husbands, love your wives
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.940]   "and do not be embittered against them."
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.780]   Here's another passage that I'm gonna refer to
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.740]   a couple times, so I'm gonna read it for you here,
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.660]   and it's important for us.
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.920]   It says, 1 Peter 3, verse one through six,
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.960]   "In the same way, you wives,
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.720]   "be submissive to your own husbands,
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.280]   "so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word,
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.880]   "they may be won without a word
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.060]   "by the behavior of their wives,
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.720]   "as they observe your chast and respectful behavior.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.000]   "Your adornment must not be merely external,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.320]   "braiding the hair and wearing gold jewelry
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.100]   "or putting on dresses,
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.900]   "but let it be the hidden person of the heart,
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.400]   "but the imperishable quality
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.480]   "of a gentle and quiet spirit,
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.800]   "which is precious in the sight of God.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.320]   "For in this way, in former times,
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.540]   "a holy woman also, who hoped in God,
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.240]   "used to adorn themselves,
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.360]   "being submissive to their own husbands,
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.040]   "just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.280]   "And you have become her children
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.860]   "if you do what is right
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.720]   "without being frightened by any fear."
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.560]   Okay?
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.560]   So what you have there is you have some
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.200]   cross-references and other passages
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.080]   that describe the element of submissiveness,
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.280]   and more importantly, in the 1 Peter passage,
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.040]   it talks about how there's this respectful behavior
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.920]   in the way that Sarah treated Abraham.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.080]   Now, giving you a couple tangible examples,
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.160]   I wanna give you a tangible respect
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.360]   that I sometimes think about,
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.800]   and it's the relationship that I have with our elders,
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.720]   particularly with Elder James, James Hong,
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.080]   and I'm gonna use him as an example.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:27.560]   Did you know that our friendship has gone now 20 years?
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.400]   Okay?
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.360]   He met me when I was a wee little 18-year-old.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.400]   James actually was to me in college an older brother,
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.040]   a true older brother in the faith, okay?
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.440]   He was actually my small group leader.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.160]   He actually helped me sign up for my classes.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.040]   I came into UCI as a bitter child
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.440]   who didn't get into the school that he wanted to,
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.680]   and I was procrastinating signing up for classes,
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.760]   and he helped me and showed me the ropes.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.440]   He also helped me and showed me the ropes around the school,
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.120]   and he also challenged me in my faith,
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.840]   'cause I was essentially a recent convert, so to speak,
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.960]   just a year into my faith.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.000]   And so here's a small group leader of mine
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.600]   who's been kind of guiding me.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.840]   Being an old brother, I would crash at his house,
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.400]   he would let me just use his stuff, all that kind of thing.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.160]   I mean, again, I could just keep going on.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.720]   He sold me his bike, all that kind of stuff.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.600]   But the cool thing is his love for me as a brother
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.360]   caused him, when I became a pastor,
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.440]   he immediately just started to call me Pastor Mark.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.800]   I mean, think about how awkward that can be, you know?
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.000]   I never asked him to call me Pastor Mark, he just said it.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.760]   And then as the years went by,
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.200]   he became an elder at the church,
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.440]   and then so I call him Elder James,
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.880]   which essentially in terms of authority at the church,
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.320]   he has greater authority and say
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.400]   as to the direction of the church
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.000]   and the final decisions that we make
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.120]   in the daily operations of what the church is going to do.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.440]   Our relationship is weird.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.640]   But I want you to think about this
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.400]   because the respect is just given mutually.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.000]   The kind of respect we have for each other
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.360]   is in the context of brotherly love,
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.320]   is in the context of best interest for the church,
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.440]   and it can be an awesome thing, right?
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.040]   It can be an awesome thing.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.920]   I think about things like submission
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.040]   and sometimes a lot of people are like, "Whoa."
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.760]   But the thing about it is, again,
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.120]   I'm called to submit to my elders,
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.400]   and I would gladly do it because if you told me,
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.760]   "Mark, you need to submit to your elders,"
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.880]   I'm not gonna sit here and be like, "Say what?"
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.080]   Right, I would sit there and be like, "Gladly."
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:30.920]   And I actually tell them,
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.280]   "Elders, you tell me what you would like to have done,
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.840]   "I'll do it.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.560]   "Say whatever you need, I'll do it."
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.560]   Why?
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.200]   Because that submission and respect
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.160]   happens in the context of trust.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.200]   That submission and respect happens in the context
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.480]   of working together and being like-minded
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.440]   and united in Christ.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.240]   And when that all happens in that context,
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.800]   it's actually a beautiful thing.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.680]   And I love it.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.880]   I'm so thankful, so grateful.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.920]   Okay, now, at the same time,
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.280]   I think some people do,
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.760]   like I can give an example of that,
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.920]   but a lot of people may give example of,
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.680]   "Well, what about this time when authority was abused?
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.280]   "Well, what about this time when we,
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.080]   "when you have these hierarchies
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.880]   "and it's gonna be dangerous for everybody, right?"
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.720]   I get it.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.160]   But in terms of the home,
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.800]   we have to work this way.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.040]   So let me just make a quick, quick hermeneutical note,
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.200]   very fast, okay?
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.440]   Which is one, we have to ask the question,
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.320]   as we're studying Ephesians chapter five,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.480]   chapter five, verse 21 and on,
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.920]   what does this passage specifically say in command?
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.720]   And what's very clear is, again,
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.480]   without definitions of the word,
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.880]   it gives a specific command
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.600]   of what the home is supposed to look like
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.080]   and what the wife is supposed to do
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.520]   in terms of both action and attitude towards her husband.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.320]   And that's what you call the biblical theology
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.520]   of what does this passage say?
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.040]   What does this book in the Bible say?
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:52.880]   Okay?
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.080]   Next, in order to try to understand the concept,
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.760]   we start to do systematic theology
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.840]   where we compare to all the other references in the Bible,
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.800]   right, at this point,
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   we're still just comparing passage to passage.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.640]   And we're saying,
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.600]   how did this contribute to the concept
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.600]   in the whole of scripture?
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.240]   And how all the other passages contribute to this idea?
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.080]   Okay?
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.080]   Only then can you ask the question,
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.160]   well, then how does it apply?
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.360]   And these instances that I see,
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.600]   how am I supposed to actually navigate
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.960]   through the application?
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.280]   That's your practical theology.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.680]   That's your philosophical theology.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.120]   How do you make sense of it in the concept
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.560]   in real world application?
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.240]   But you can't work backwards and say,
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.280]   no, no, no, no, no.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.120]   We're not gonna do that
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.840]   because it doesn't make practical sense.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.880]   That would be backwards.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.400]   The authority of God dictates
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.800]   that we have to work in this fashion
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.480]   where first goes, what did he say?
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.760]   What did he say collectively
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.960]   that gives us the various principles
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.000]   that contribute to my understanding?
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.480]   And then the question becomes,
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.360]   it may be difficult to apply.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.560]   Now, how do I do it?
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.680]   Okay?
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.440]   So part of the reason why I think there can be a problem
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.200]   is because I want to make note.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.280]   This passage you might think is very short.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.520]   And it is.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.040]   Verse 22 to 24, it's just a couple of verses, right?
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.640]   Three verses.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.960]   But notice how this passage tells us
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.080]   that wise we should be subject to your own husbands
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.000]   as to the Lord.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.480]   And if you look at all these terms
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.200]   and the rationale and the model behind it,
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.840]   you realize there are parameters.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.360]   And you kind of noticed that that's what I started to do.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.560]   This command comes to us in a context.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.240]   It does not say, husbands do whatever you want
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.880]   because you rule.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.000]   Do it, right?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.880]   That's not what it said.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.440]   Neither did it say, listen,
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.600]   I want you to be subject to your own husbands
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.800]   as to your boss, to your earthly king.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.200]   That's not what it said.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.680]   It said, as to the Lord.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.360]   I do not think this passage means,
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.720]   and nobody I think thinks that this passage means
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.360]   that all of a sudden you become so subservient
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.200]   to your husband that you are like a child to him
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.840]   as a parent.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.480]   No, your relationship and husband and wife, one.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.360]   There's a oneness between you.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.080]   And within that oneness,
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.240]   there's an embedded authority and submission
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.240]   that is beautiful in the eyes of God
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.880]   as he has designed it, right?
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.200]   And I like to say again,
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.040]   I think people who automatically think that,
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.640]   oh, this means I have to submit to him
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.720]   like a commanding officer.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.320]   This means I have to submit to him
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.720]   like some authoritarian dictator.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.320]   No, I don't think that is the case.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.160]   And then you have to do the work of thinking through
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.640]   what are the parameters here?
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.680]   So we begin.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.640]   What are the parameters?
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.480]   One, your willing submission to your husband as a wife
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.240]   is an act of love and honor.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.080]   Why?
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.800]   Because let's make the observation.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.080]   It says, "Wise, be subject to your own husband's
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.680]   "as to the Lord."
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.560]   Pause there a little bit.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.240]   If your immediate reaction,
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.040]   when you hear the word, "as to the Lord,"
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.400]   is like the Lord, right?
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.520]   Yes, me Lord.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.040]   Like if that's what you're thinking,
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.280]   then now all of a sudden it's like a question.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.680]   It's like, what did you think about the Lord?
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.560]   What is your perception of your Lord?
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.160]   Because some people are like, "Lord," you know?
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.920]   And some people are like, "Lord," right?
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.280]   Like, that's different.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.040]   And so if you felt like Lord meant that guy over there
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:29.000]   who, yes, I'm supposed to submit to and love,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.360]   but him just being there just makes me feel guilty
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.040]   and pressured, I get it.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.560]   I have to submit to him.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.320]   Then yeah, you're gonna feel the exact same way
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.200]   that perhaps your husband, that guy,
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.920]   I know I'm supposed to.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:45.840]   That attitude really should not be the case, right?
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.160]   Because truthfully speaking,
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.680]   when you think about your Lord,
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.680]   you should be thinking, "Precious Jesus who loves me."
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.920]   You know what else I wanna highlight for you?
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.360]   I wanna highlight for you this,
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.200]   just one single word, "Om."
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.760]   And what you'll notice is that in the other passages
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.560]   in 1 Peter, in the passages of Titus,
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.520]   in the other passages that describes marriage,
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.400]   God expects the marriage to be intimate,
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.840]   one, united, exclusive, committed thing.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.040]   It's supposed to be beautiful.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.800]   And you and your Lord are supposed to have that, right?
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.000]   You and your Lord are supposed to have such an exclusive,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.480]   pure, undefiled relationship
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.000]   that your love can freely just flow.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.280]   All the love you have in your heart,
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.000]   you could just give it without like,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.360]   "Is he gonna take advantage of me?
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.720]   Like, is he gonna essentially screw me over?"
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.480]   Like, that kind of fear is not there with Christ
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.160]   because we trust him.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.200]   And the idea here is you need to be subject
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.480]   to your own husband, not to every man out there,
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.560]   not to all the dudes,
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.880]   it's to your own husbands as to the Lord.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.880]   And so this exercise of submission is in that context.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.880]   And here's another observation.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.120]   Notice how it says,
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   "For the rationale is for the husband is the head."
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:06.960]   Okay?
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.800]   And so what you have there is that there is a design of God
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.880]   where he has instilled in the husband position
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.200]   and role a headship.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.320]   And what I'd like to highlight for you
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.400]   is this other passage in 1 Peter 2
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.840]   that describes when we respect the design of God
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.800]   in hierarchy and authority, we are doing him honor.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.880]   We're acting like honorable people.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.720]   Check this out.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.520]   Verse 16 of 1 Peter 2.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.960]   "Act as free men and do not use your freedom
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.760]   as a covering for evil,
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.160]   but use it as bond slaves of God.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.560]   Honor all people, love the brotherhood,
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.200]   fear God and honor the King."
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.040]   You see that?
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.040]   It's like basically do what's right in the eyes of God.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.400]   Respect what he's designed.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.600]   Know how to behave like an individual who is in control
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.640]   and not just, you know, rebellious
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.000]   and doing whatever I want.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.920]   "Servants be submissive to your masters with all respect,
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.960]   not only to those who are good and gentle,
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.040]   but also to those who are unreasonable,
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.760]   for this finds favor.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.040]   If for the sake of conscience toward God,
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:14.040]   a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly."
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.560]   This is honorable.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.560]   And notice this passage doesn't have anything
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.720]   about wives and husbands,
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.840]   but it has everything to do
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.080]   about all the other relationships in your life
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.160]   where authority and submission are exercised.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.400]   Okay?
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.480]   So I want you to think about this again,
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.360]   that the honoring of the design of God in the hierarchy
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.320]   is actually something pleasing in the eyes of God
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.920]   and not necessarily heinous and abhorrent or injustice.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.360]   Now, there can be a counter argument here.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.720]   And the counter argument, it could be,
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.320]   okay, I get that the design is supposed to be such a way,
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.200]   but my husband is not Jesus.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:02.200]   I still know I'm supposed to submit as unto Christ,
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.160]   as fitting as to Christ,
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.680]   but what if maybe you're not married
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.520]   and you're kind of worried,
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.400]   like what if he's so far from Jesus?
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.040]   Like he's not even a third of the man that Jesus was,
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.120]   or maybe you're thinking like,
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.920]   yeah, I wish I could, but he makes it hard.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.120]   I wonder if that could be a counter argument
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.520]   and I understand that part.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.960]   And that leads me into the next point.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.360]   Point number four,
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.600]   your willing submission is a powerful trust in Christ,
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.800]   a powerful, an amazing trust in Christ.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.880]   And that is our faith,
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   where we trust the sovereign power of God in Christ.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.920]   'Cause I get the argument
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.120]   that a man can be insensitive, thoughtless,
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.040]   and just kind of baffling
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.560]   in terms of the kind of harm and pain he could do
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.760]   because he's not thinking,
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.200]   or he could be unintentionally proud,
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.400]   sometimes angry and filled with all kinds of strange,
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.520]   but also perverse desires.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.360]   Why do I say that?
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.040]   Because if I look at myself,
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.400]   I have done all those things.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.040]   Have I been insensitive, thoughtless,
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.200]   very careless and hurtful?
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.560]   The answer is yes.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:12.480]   And I get the argument that he is not Jesus,
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.800]   and so this is difficult.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.080]   Again, understood.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:21.680]   However, notice that this passage,
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.760]   when it says be subject to your own husbands,
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.120]   it has no qualifier.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.080]   There is no, when he's really thinking of you
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.280]   and he acts like Jesus, there's no qualifier.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.200]   What's more, please observe that the passage says
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.760]   that this is the way you ought to behave
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.240]   towards your husbands in everything.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.400]   Well, the reason why I say there's no qualifier,
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.280]   because in everything has no qualifier.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.240]   What's more, the position for the lady I understand.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.680]   Is a position of vulnerability.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.160]   But likewise is our entire salvation.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.800]   Likewise is so many other facets of our lives.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.440]   So what am I saying here?
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.440]   Please understand that yes, this can be very difficult
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.360]   and I wonder sometimes, wow, the lady in the relationship
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.560]   has perhaps an even more difficult expectation from God
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.200]   than of the man.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.280]   Because she must then subject herself to this kind
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.760]   of powerful trust that God will take care of me.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.680]   That obeying God is gonna be fruitful,
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.560]   even if that man's not fruitful.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.400]   And who will honor me is my Lord.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:38.040]   That's a powerful statement.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.280]   And so when I look at this passage,
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.120]   and first Peter, remember I said I was gonna refer
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.800]   to it a lot, look at it, it says,
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.120]   in the same way you wives be submissive
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.080]   to your own husbands so that even if any of them
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.680]   are disobedient to the word, they may be won
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.880]   without a word by the behavior of their wives.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.960]   And then he says, and as they observe your chast
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.720]   and respectful behavior, your adornment must not be
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.720]   merely external, braiding of hair, wearing of gold jewelry,
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.240]   or putting on dresses.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.760]   But you know why he says that?
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.520]   It's because when it's not working,
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.280]   and you're not getting the respect,
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.560]   and you're not getting the kind of love,
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.040]   you could resort to manipulation.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.240]   You could resort to other means to make yourself
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.400]   more desirable to your husband.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.920]   But rather than resorting to human wisdom,
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.160]   rather than resorting to your own flesh,
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.680]   what do these ladies do?
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.480]   They let it be the hidden person of the heart
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.400]   with the imperishable quality of a gentle
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.160]   and quiet spirit which is precious in the sight of God.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.040]   For in this way, in former times,
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.280]   the holy women also, who did what?
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.640]   Who hoped in God.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.880]   They didn't hope that, and again,
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.440]   he's gonna reference Sarah and stuff,
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.000]   they didn't hope that Abraham would come around.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.920]   They didn't hope that Moses would be better.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.240]   They didn't put their hope in themselves
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.840]   or in man they hoped in God, used to adorn themselves,
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.280]   being submissive to their own husband.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.960]   Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord,
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.720]   and you have become her children if you do what is right,
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.200]   if you behave honorably without being frightened
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.440]   by any fear.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.800]   So, truthfully speaking, when we see individuals
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.240]   who do not resort to their human flesh,
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.680]   bitterness, anger, retaliation,
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.720]   but rather entrust themselves over to God,
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.960]   we see an incredible power.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.000]   That's strength.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.400]   And again, I wanna say, continuing on,
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:41.840]   this really is appropriate because
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.640]   in terms of that little statement earlier
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.000]   when I highlighted that he says
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.640]   he himself is the savior of the body,
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.440]   you see the reflection of what's happening here.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.160]   You see the picture that's being painted.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:58.160]   Jesus, man, Jesus is the savior of the church.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.400]   Jesus is the head of the church.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.840]   The position and the role-playing that is happening
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.440]   is reflective of the vulnerability
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.360]   and the dependency that every human being has,
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.320]   but God wants the woman to exhibit it as a model.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.000]   And so I go to my last point, which is,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.320]   your willing submission is a beautiful reflection
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.760]   of the gospel, okay?
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.240]   It's a beautiful reflection of the gospel.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.800]   Why?
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.120]   Apostle Paul straight up says, verse 32,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.280]   "This mystery is great, but I am speaking
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.480]   "with reference to Christ and the church."
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.560]   The rationale given is not so much the rationale,
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.800]   like, guys, this is gonna work out,
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.000]   and then next thing you know,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.800]   you're just gonna have better children.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.360]   You're like, children are gonna be raised in a better home,
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.560]   and it's gonna be great for the, you know,
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.760]   he says, "This is picturing something
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.800]   "of incredible magnitude, which is our salvation."
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.760]   The gospel is so important.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:59.480]   I have now used your role as wife to picture it.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.760]   The gospel is so important.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.800]   I have used the role of the husband to picture it,
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.480]   and therefore, we must reflect the relationship
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.000]   between the Savior and his people.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.200]   That's what he's saying.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.840]   When we recognize the headship role,
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.840]   and we are responding, this volitional act of submission
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:27.080]   is a beautiful reflection of the gospel,
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.000]   and that's why earlier I said, don't think in your mind
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.920]   that when the scripture challenges you
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.800]   to submit to your husband's ask to the Lord,
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.680]   don't think, I'm just submitting to my boss.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.520]   Don't do it.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.360]   You know why?
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.000]   Because that is super duper shy
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.040]   of what God is trying to picture.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.360]   Don't think like, okay, I'm just gonna do what he says,
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.720]   and just whatever, and I'll do it,
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.160]   like he's my commanding officer.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.000]   Don't do that.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.760]   Please don't do that, because that picture of you
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.440]   thinking that you're in the military
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.560]   is super duper shy of the grand picture that he has
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.240]   of the Savior and the church.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.440]   That makes sense, right?
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.760]   And I wanna put it to you in another way.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.960]   When you think about the response,
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.880]   verse 24, observe, is a model for us,
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.880]   and that model is the attitude.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.020]   The model is the manner by which we're responding to Christ.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.240]   We, the church, we're responding to Christ,
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.760]   and you, the wives, the ladies, are responding to that.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.360]   You're picturing it, okay?
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.060]   So I want you to think about that.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.880]   This is a strange way to say it,
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.420]   but have you ever thought about submission,
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.960]   not as like, you know what,
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.800]   I'm gonna do what I don't wanna do.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:43.480]   That is a very simplistic definition of what submission is.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.840]   You have a will, he has a will,
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.560]   and you say, not mine, but yours.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.400]   I gave it to you earlier, it makes sense,
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.080]   that is a definition.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.680]   However, when you conceive of submission,
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:58.300]   have you thought of it like that package of the submission,
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.400]   the submissive heart?
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:03.320]   This is my gift to you in love, right?
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.160]   Have you ever thought about it that way?
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.260]   It was just Father's Day,
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.980]   and you know, there's those commercials
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.100]   where it's like, this Christmas, or this Mother's Day,
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.260]   this Father's Day, give the gift of love,
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.400]   and then it's like, earrings, right?
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.880]   It's a new watch, it's a fishing pole, right?
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.900]   Have you ever thought about, okay, don't get offended,
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.660]   as I said, it's like, this Father's Day,
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.740]   give the gift of submission, right?
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.660]   If you thought about it that way, it'd be kinda weird,
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.300]   but have you ever thought about submission
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.560]   as not just this, like, I'm gonna grind my teeth
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.220]   and just do it, okay, if you need to do that,
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.880]   it's better than nothing,
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.500]   but have you thought about it even better than that,
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.820]   which is, you know what, I'm going to love
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.260]   by giving the submission to you,
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.360]   willingly and freely, why?
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.100]   Why?
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:49.660]   Because that submission is the picture
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.860]   of grace received, grace giving.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:56.700]   Grace received from God, I can give grace blessings
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.100]   to the Lord, bless the Lord who has blessed us,
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.740]   and then we bless everybody else, and we love,
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.680]   and because we've been blessed so richly
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:07.140]   and we're overflowing, you can love and you can love,
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.220]   like, vertical and then horizontally,
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:12.220]   you can do that because of what Christ has done for you,
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.220]   and that, to us, is the picture
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.320]   that our hearts have been changed,
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.040]   because the picture that God has given to us
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.700]   is not a picture where he says, first and foremost,
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.160]   husbands, make sure you subject your wives
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.740]   in submission to you because you're the man.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.980]   That's not what it said,
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.640]   because that would not be a picture of Christ's first advent.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.960]   That's not the picture of the gospel.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.080]   He did not come to be served, but to serve.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.640]   If that were the picture of the gospel,
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.240]   where the husband subjects the wife into obedience,
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.960]   that would be his second coming.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.400]   That would be his return when there is no room for mercies,
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:57.400]   but rather, he is going to make sure every knee bows, right?
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.440]   The picture of his first coming is he has given grace,
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.940]   and we freely say, to you, Lord,
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:09.780]   not my way, but yours, I love you.
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:14.520]   I will gladly say I wanna support you.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.620]   I'll be about your business.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.000]   You take the lead, right?
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.400]   And God wanted a picture of this in our marriages.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.720]   To some, they might think, that's not fair,
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.400]   but rather than thinking about this with fairness,
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.360]   because remember, you tried to stick fairness
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.960]   into the gospel, and it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.420]   whoa, right?
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:41.140]   This is God designed to picture this free giving of love
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.000]   in an incredible relationship
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.820]   where in the context of the relationship,
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:50.460]   authority, submission, and love all work together.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:55.280]   And so, I want to remind you that not only is
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.320]   the relationship between husband and wife a picture
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.440]   of holiness and a picture of purity,
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.840]   it's a picture of salvific truth,
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.360]   and the relationship between Christ the Savior
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.800]   and his church.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.340]   What an incredible responsibility we have, right?
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.360]   And what I wanna say is by way of conclusion,
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.660]   I think about this passage, and I'm like, wow,
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:23.040]   the way that God is in his wisdom working things is crazy,
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.240]   because when you look at the role of the husband,
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.400]   the husband has all these responsibilities,
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.080]   and I've always thought like, you know what, look at this.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.280]   The husband role has like a bunch of verses, right?
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.840]   It's got eight verses.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.460]   The wife's role has three, so, you know,
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.280]   more responsibility and burden on the man.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.640]   But when you think about it,
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:47.540]   what is God trying to do in terms of a goal for the wife?
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:51.840]   When you read this, it says, husband, love your wives,
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.720]   just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her,
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.080]   so that, there's like a purpose statement there,
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.000]   he might sanctify her.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.100]   So God's intention for the wife in this relationship
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.940]   is to sanctify her, having cleansed her,
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.800]   washed her by the word, that he might present to himself
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.420]   the church in all her glory, having no spot, no wrinkle,
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.960]   but that she would be holy and blameless,
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.560]   so the husbands ought also to love their own wives
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.920]   as their own bodies.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.920]   You're like ladies who are feminists,
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.600]   and are like, no, I will not be subject to anybody, right?
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.520]   Like, it's just a wrong, wrong worldview, why?
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:36.120]   Because what God wants to do is subject the church
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.760]   to his holy love,
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.880]   subject the church to his lavishing grace,
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.280]   his sanctifying intent,
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.280]   and his desire to present the church in all her glory,
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.120]   because she's embedded into her his glory.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.520]   And then here she is thinking,
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.720]   no, I'll be subjected to nobody, right?
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.060]   Like, what is that?
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.520]   We can't be thinking like that.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.880]   The way it's supposed to work is this relationship
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.720]   is supposed to show the incredible love of God
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:14.000]   that is radically changing us to be holy and pure.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.040]   And so in this way, when the husband actually has
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.040]   that desire and is thinking like God and saying,
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:23.120]   I'm going to love you with all that I am
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.360]   to the degree that loving you is loving me, right?
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.840]   And when they do this for each other,
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.240]   they become one in such a God-honoring way.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.120]   And so let's commit ourselves to not take
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.160]   the world's thoughts of what is fair,
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.660]   what is right in the home,
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.120]   but to see God's intention and purpose
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.120]   in his beautiful design.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.520]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.760]   Heavenly Father, we recognize God
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.000]   that you are God all wise and all true.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.120]   And Lord, you have called us to know your wisdom,
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.240]   to hear it and to walk in it.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.520]   And I pray, Father God, that we will apply it
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:05.520]   in the places where it exhibits itself the most,
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:09.000]   which is where we live the most of our lives in our homes.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.440]   And I pray that our church, God, we will recognize,
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.280]   Lord, we have to be the ones
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.160]   that recognize, Lord, we have to rise to the call
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.640]   to build godly families
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.880]   that are founded on your love and truth.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.600]   And I pray, Father God, that we will jettison
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.900]   and forsake any selfish ambition,
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.320]   all pride that gets in the way,
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.800]   all attempts at self-preservation,
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.980]   and we would follow after the example of Christ,
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.580]   such selfless sacrifice.
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.700]   And I pray, Father God, that when we do that,
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.820]   we would reap the fruits,
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.580]   we would have the joy of building and establishing
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.380]   the kind of family that you desire.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.260]   And God, then we would have the clarity of mind
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:56.540]   and conscience to know we are pleasing you
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.100]   and we're following after your footsteps.
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.540]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
