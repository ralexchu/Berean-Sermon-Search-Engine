[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:26.680]   - All right, good morning.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.680]   Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.680]   We wanna welcome you to our church.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.680]   We have a few announcements before we get started.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.680]   First of all, our fall Bible study that's starting
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.680]   in September, the 12-week course on the book of Titus.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.680]   It's titled "Life in the Father's House."
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.680]   It's gonna be led by Pastor Peter Chung.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.680]   We are taking sign-ups now.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.680]   So even though you've been attending the same Bible study
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.680]   or home group for many sessions,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.680]   we ask that you sign up because we wanna make sure
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.680]   that we have enough room in the homes
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.680]   and the small group is prepared ahead of time.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.680]   So please sign up as soon as you can.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.680]   And then the first Bible study's gonna start
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.680]   on the first week of September.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.680]   So the sign-up needs to be going on right now.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   So please sign up for that.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.680]   And then again, the Bible study lab,
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.680]   that's starting on first week of August.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.680]   So the Bible study itself in Titus is starting in September.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.680]   The Bible study lab is a one-hour course,
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.680]   I think three weeks or four weeks,
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.680]   being led by Pastor Mark Lim.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.680]   And it's how to do inductive Bible study,
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.680]   which is what we do in Titus.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.680]   So if you don't know how to do that
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.680]   or you need a refresher to help you with that,
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.680]   Pastor Mark is gonna be leading that starting from August 1st,
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.680]   and it's gonna be from two to three o'clock.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.680]   Okay, I think it's three or four weeks.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   Yeah, two to three o'clock.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   It says three weeks.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.680]   So again, if you know of someone that would benefit from that,
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.680]   and it will help you a lot to be able to engage
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.680]   in the Bible study that we do in September.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.680]   So if you just need a refresher
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.680]   or you know somebody that would benefit from that,
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.680]   please have them sign up for that.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.680]   And again, it's on the church app,
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.680]   Facebook page and our church website,
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.680]   and you'll be able to sign up for that, okay?
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.680]   Again, please do that as soon as you can
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   so that we can better prepare.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.680]   We have a members meeting that's coming up,
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.680]   not next Sunday but Sunday after on July 25th at 2.30.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.680]   And again, it is a quarterly meeting that is mandatory,
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.680]   so if you cannot make it, please let us know ahead of time.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.680]   There's going to be a service fair, meaning it's--
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.680]   I think it's ever since we shut down and we got back up,
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.680]   this is the first time we're having our service team
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.680]   and members meeting live, and so it's not going to be online.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.680]   It's only gonna be live,
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.680]   and we will have service team fair outside
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.680]   where you can walk around and see what kind of service teams
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.680]   and what kind of things that are happening in the church.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.680]   And so some of it is being presented
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.680]   because they're trying to recruit people to come help out.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.680]   Some of it is just to present to you
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.680]   that this is what's happening at church.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.680]   This is what's happening in the elementary department.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.680]   This is what's happening in our outreach ministry
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.680]   and for young adults, singles, the seasons.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.680]   You know, there's actually a ministry for people
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.680]   who are a little bit older, okay?
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.680]   So not old, a little bit older.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.680]   So we have a ministry for that as well.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   Usually people who come in a little bit older
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.680]   kind of say, "Everybody's in college,"
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.680]   and you'd be surprised to know how many people
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.680]   are at the age of 40, 50, and a little bit older than that, okay?
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.680]   So it's a presentation of those ministries that are happening.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.680]   So for members meeting, that's gonna be set up outside.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   So please, if you cannot make it, please let us know ahead of time.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   And then BCC's soul safety training meeting.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.680]   So if you are around the children or if you're teaching in any capacity,
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   you have to be safety trained,
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.680]   and that's taking place on July 25th at 1:30 to 2:30 p.m.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.680]   So please mark that on your calendar.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.680]   And if you're one of those people that needs to be trained
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.680]   or planning to serve in that capacity,
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.680]   that's something that you must take.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.680]   So please mark that on your calendar as well.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.680]   I mentioned this last week.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.680]   We have a cafe night that's coming up on July 31st at 7:30,
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.680]   and this is an outreach event that our outreach team,
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.680]   being led by our brother Jun Im, is hosting.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.680]   And so in order to prepare for that, July 17th, 18th,
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.680]   and then a big outing on the 24th, they're doing street evangelism.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.680]   And so if you want to participate in that,
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.680]   and all of this is to prepare for this cafe night.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.680]   So you probably got one of these as you're coming in,
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.680]   and this is so that you can have this with you,
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.680]   and then you can, you know, share it with your friends.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.680]   And even if you're not bringing anybody,
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.680]   and you don't have anybody specific in mind,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.680]   if you could, again, just continue to keep in prayer.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.680]   And as I've mentioned to you before,
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.680]   that because of all the stuff that's been going on around us,
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.680]   whether it's political or whether it's the pandemic or whatever,
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.680]   we've at least sensed that there's a greater interest in the things of eternity
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.680]   that the non-Christian world is more willing to talk about.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.680]   And so we want to take advantage of that.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.680]   And so if you have people around you that are interested,
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.680]   please let the outreach team know.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.680]   And also, again, if you would join us in prayer in preparation for that day as well.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.680]   Okay? All right.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.680]   Okay. Let me pray for us.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.680]   And again, if you have physical offering, please, after the service,
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.680]   you can walk back and put it into the box.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.680]   And again, I want to encourage you,
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.680]   if you are able to use other avenues other than PayPal, Venmo,
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.680]   we want to encourage you to do that because we're having some issues
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.680]   with Venmo.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.680]   So if Venmo is the only avenue you have, we are accepting that.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.680]   But if you are able to do the other, we encourage you to use the other.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:35.680]   Okay? All right. Let's pray.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.680]   Gracious Father, we just want to thank you for your continued grace
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.680]   that sustains us.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.680]   Help us to worship you genuinely in spirit and in truth.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   That whatever it is that we have gone through this week,
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.680]   and I know that there are brothers and sisters who are suffering
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:55.680]   through various illnesses, trials, Lord God, in their lives,
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.680]   and some of us just the daily grind of going to work and taking care
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.680]   of our children and just trying to survive from week to week.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.680]   I pray, Father God, that our worship would cause us, Lord,
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.680]   to see a greater glimpse of who you are,
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.680]   that we would not be entangled with the temporary things of this world,
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.680]   that we would be reminded again the hope that we have in Christ,
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.680]   the eternity that is coming with his glory,
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.680]   that we may truly worship you in our singing, our giving,
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   in every way that your name may be honored.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.680]   I pray that even this offering would be multiplied, given to you in joy,
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.680]   in celebration, in an act of worship,
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.680]   that it may be used, Lord God, to expand your kingdom.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.680]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   We stand and lift.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.680]   We stand and lift up our hands
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.680]   For the joy of the Lord is our strength
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:02.680]   We bow down and worship him now
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:07.680]   How great, how awesome is he

[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   We bow down and worship him now
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:06.680]   How great, how awesome is he
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.680]   Together we sing
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:17.680]   Everyone sing

[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:28.680]   My hope is built
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:33.680]   on nothing less than Jesus'
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.680]   blood and righteousness
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:41.680]   I dare not trust the sweetest frame
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   But wholly lean on Jesus' name
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.680]   On Christ the solid rock I stand
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.680]   All other ground is sinking sand
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.680]   All other ground is sinking sand

[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.680]   His lovely face
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.680]   I rest on his unchanging grace
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.680]   In every high and stormy gale
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:37.680]   My anchor holds within the veil
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   On Christ the solid rock I stand
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   All other ground is sinking sand
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:51.680]   All other ground is sinking sand
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   [Music]
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   His oath, his covenant, his blood
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.680]   Support me in the whelming flood
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   When all around my soul gives way
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.680]   He then is all my hope and stay
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.680]   On Christ the solid rock I stand
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.680]   All other ground is sinking sand
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   All other ground is sinking sand
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.680]   [Music]
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:59.680]   When he shall come
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.680]   When he shall come
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.680]   With trumpet sound
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.680]   Oh may I then in him be found
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:13.680]   Dressed in his righteousness alone
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:18.680]   Faithless to stand before the throne
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.680]   On Christ the solid rock I stand
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.680]   All other ground is sinking sand
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.680]   All other ground is sinking sand
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:37.680]   On Christ the solid rock I stand
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.680]   All other ground is sinking sand
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:48.680]   All other ground is sinking sand
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.680]   Amen. You may be seated.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:27:03.680]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.680]   And I'm going to be reading from verse 18 to 24.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.680]   Hebrews chapter 12 verse 18 to 24.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   Hebrews chapter 12 verse 18 to 24.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.680]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.680]   For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched,
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.680]   and to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.680]   and to the blast of trumpet and the sound of words,
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:35.680]   which sound was such that those who heard begged that no further word be spoken to them.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.680]   For they could not bear the command,
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   even if a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.680]   And so terrible was the sight that Moses said,
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.680]   I am full of fear and trembling.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.680]   But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God,
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.680]   the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.680]   to the general assembly and church of the firstborn,
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.680]   who are enthralled in heaven and to God,
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.680]   the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.680]   and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant,
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.680]   and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.680]   Let's pray.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.680]   Heavenly Father, we pray for guidance.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:22.680]   We pray for the weightiness of your word to strike our thoughts,
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.680]   our hearts, and our very lives.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.680]   Ordain these times, Lord God, that we may see a glimpse of who you are,
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.680]   that we may remember who it is that we worship,
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.680]   who it is that saved us,
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   and that who it is, Lord, that we are hoping to come, Lord God, and redeem.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.680]   So we pray for your blessing. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   I have a tendency, when I watch movies, it's hard for me to stay awake.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.680]   So I have, I think that part of the reason is I don't get good sleep,
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.680]   so I'm kind of perpetually a bit tired.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.680]   And the other part of it is there's like something going on in my head constantly,
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.680]   and it's hard for me to turn it off.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.680]   So as soon as when there's, you know, I get distracted, I tend to relax.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.680]   And so when I relax, I fall asleep.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.680]   You know, so it's a running joke in my house whenever we watch a movie
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.680]   to see how long it's going to take before I fall asleep.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.680]   You know, the good part of that is I can watch the same movies over and over again.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.680]   You know, remember when Blockbuster used to be open?
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.680]   Like Esther would tell me to go pick up a movie,
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.680]   and then I don't know how many times I would come back thinking,
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.680]   like, "This movie looks good," and then she would just start laughing.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.680]   We just saw that four months ago, you know, and I just don't remember anything, you know.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.680]   And so that's the benefit of that.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:47.680]   But the bad part of it is I can't thoroughly explain to you any movie,
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.680]   because at some point I fell asleep.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.680]   And I remember very specifically this movie, the movie Up.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.680]   And I forgot how old my children were, but our whole family went to watch it.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.680]   And I remember it started out well with this old man growing old together with his wife,
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.680]   and then I fell asleep.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   And then I woke up, and this crazy bird is on top of Grand Canyon with this balloon,
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.680]   and for the rest of the movie, it's like, "What is going on?"
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.680]   And I was like, "Esther, what's going on?"
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.680]   She's like, "Just watch the movie."
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.680]   They were so riveted by this movie, and I couldn't even ask.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.680]   So the whole movie, I had no understanding what happened.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   Something happened that caused this man living in the suburbs, enjoying his life,
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.680]   is being chased by this crazy bird, right?
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.680]   So obviously I had to watch it again, and I said, "Oh, that was a crucial part that I fell asleep in."
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:39.680]   Another movie that I remember very distinctly was the movie Inception.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.680]   And everybody said, "Oh, it was such a great movie."
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.680]   Then I just remember every time they fell asleep, I fell asleep.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.680]   And then I woke up. It's like, "What is this? How many dreams does he have?"
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:55.680]   And then recently we said, "You know what? Let's watch it again because maybe it will make more sense to me."
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.680]   And sure enough, I fell asleep.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:03.680]   So to this day, all I know is it's about dream.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.680]   Something happens in the dream, and then there's this little thing that they turn at the end,
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.680]   and then they die.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.680]   So I can't explain to you exactly what happened, but that's kind of what I remember.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:19.680]   So unless the movie is riveting, I usually have a hard time staying awake.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.680]   That's why I love AMC theaters because they have the recliner now.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.680]   So whenever I go watch a movie with them, usually I wake up with somebody angry
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.680]   because I snored in the middle of the movie.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.680]   Well, I say all of this because the text that we're looking at in Chapter 12, Verses 18 through 24,
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.680]   it presents to us two mountains, Mount Sinai and Mount Zion.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.680]   Mount Sinai is where the Israelites received God's commandment and the law.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.680]   So God comes and he speaks to Moses and he gives the law.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.680]   And so he's telling them, to these Jews, that you did not come to this mountain, but you came to Mount Zion.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.680]   And Mount Zion is representative of God's dwelling, God's place.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:07.680]   And so that's where they received the grace of God.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.680]   So the understanding of Mount Sinai is crucial.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:14.680]   It is essential to understanding Mount Zion,
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.680]   what it is that he was trying to present for the past 11 chapters.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.680]   But because of the way that the gospel has been presented,
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.680]   because New Testament, to be honest, is easier to understand because it's straightforward.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:30.680]   Who is God? Well, God is love. God is this.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.680]   What is the gospel? The gospel is this. What did Jesus do? He died on the cross.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.680]   He shed his blood. So it is very straightforward.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.680]   The Old Testament is all a shadow. Just like the shadow, it's not clear.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.680]   It points to something that is in reality.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.680]   But the shadow is the preparation so that when the reality comes,
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.680]   that the reality would make better sense.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.680]   But what happens is when you skip the Old Testament and you come just to the New Testament,
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.680]   there are so many things that really don't make a lot of sense.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.680]   But because you hear it over and over and over again, you don't question it.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.680]   So one of the fundamental questions about the cross,
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.680]   why did Jesus die? We know the answer.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.680]   Because he loved us, he died for our sins. But why did he die?
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.680]   Why couldn't he just forgive us?
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.680]   Because when we forgive people, we just forgive.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.680]   He shed his blood for our sins. We don't shed blood for people.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.680]   Nobody practices that. So we heard the gospel,
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.680]   especially if you grew up in the church, without ever really digging.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.680]   Why did he have to die?
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.680]   What was the shedding of blood? What was this drama of being crucified
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   dying and resurrected? What is the purpose of the church?
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   And so we have this very superficial understanding because we fell asleep
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.680]   at the crucial part of the preparation.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.680]   And so our understanding of the gospel, if I tell you,
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.680]   if you ask me what the movie Up is about, it's about an old man,
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.680]   you know, and he's lost his wife and then some crazy bird.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   But that doesn't really describe. If I tell you Inception, it's about some dream
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.680]   and then they have another dream inside of the dream and then they have many other dreams inside that dream.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:06.680]   Like that's about what I can tell you. So it's probably not wrong,
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.680]   but it's not a good synopsis of the whole movie.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:14.680]   If you grew up in the Western church, the emphasis has been predominantly,
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:19.680]   I would say 90, 95 percent of your understanding of your faith
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:23.680]   strictly comes from the New Testament because it is easier to understand.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:29.680]   In fact, years ago, I was at a pastor's conference with about 3,500 pastors in the room.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.680]   And one of the seminar was that we need to preach the Old Testament.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:41.680]   And he asked all the pastors, how many of you are currently preaching out of the Old Testament?
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.680]   And so he asked us to stand up and I happened to be one of maybe six or seven people.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.680]   And I was so proud. I was me.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:57.680]   But I was also very surprised that out of 3,500 pastors who preach on a regular basis,
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.680]   there was only about five or six of us.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.680]   And so the point that he was trying to make is the same point that I'm trying to make this morning.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:08.680]   That when we have a superficial understanding of Mount Sinai,
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.680]   you may be able to articulate Zion, his grace.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.680]   You may be able to articulate the gospel because you've heard it, you've memorized it, you sang it,
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:21.680]   but you don't understand the depth of what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:27.680]   So I actually intended to have this sermon in one sermon about explaining the Mount Sinai
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.680]   and then talking about Zion.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.680]   But I felt like I'm not going to do it justice if I just skim through Mount Sinai.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.680]   So I wanted to make sure that we studied this and what he's referring to.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.680]   And then we'll get to what when he says we didn't come to Sinai, we came to Zion,
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:49.680]   so that we'd have a better appreciation of what we talk about next week.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.680]   So let's look at it. Mount Sinai.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.680]   He said you did not come to the first chapter 12 verse 18 to 21.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:36:00.680]   For you have not come to the mountain that can be touched and to the blazing fire
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.680]   and to the darkness and the gloom and whirlwind.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   Let me just stop right here.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.680]   He's referring to God coming to give the law.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:17.680]   And the way that he describes it is blazing fire, darkness, gloom, and whirlwind.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:22.680]   Again, if you grew up in the Western Church, when we think about the presence of God,
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   when Jesus comes, I'm going to walk to him, I'm going to sit on his lap,
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.680]   depending on how old you are, hold his hand.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.680]   And so we have this lovey-dovey feeling of the presence of God.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:36.680]   The Old Testament Jew did not have that same view.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:42.680]   Their starting point at Mount Sinai was terror, gloom, and whirlwind.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.680]   And to the blast of the trumpet and the sound of words,
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:51.680]   which sound was such that those who heard begged that no further word be spoken to them.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:57.680]   Think about how often we talk about how God spoke to us or we want God to speak to us.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:03.680]   The Jews, when they heard God's voice, begged that God would stop speaking
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.680]   because they were so terrified of his presence that even when he spoke,
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.680]   they said we can't handle this.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.680]   Please ask God to stop talking to us directly.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.680]   Speak through our mediator Moses, verse 20.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   For they could not bear the command, if even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.680]   And so terrible was the sight that Moses said, I am full of fear and trembling.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:32.680]   Now prior to this event, it's not like the Israelites had no relationship with God.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.680]   They knew about God from a distance.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.680]   They heard about God.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.680]   They've seen his mighty works.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:43.680]   But this is the first instance where God from heaven is physically coming
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:49.680]   and making his physical presence known in the nation of Israel at Sinai to give the law
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:53.680]   at the inauguration of Israel as a nation.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.680]   And in his presentation, it is not a party.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   It is not a light event.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.680]   As soon as he shows up, there is fear and terror.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.680]   Fire, darkness, gloom, whirlwind.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.680]   In fact, if you can show the picture that comes up.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.680]   I want you to see the outline of the mountain.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:18.680]   Okay, so our projector isn't that sharp.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:23.680]   But if you can see, I want this picture because this is what's being described for us in Hebrews.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   And I'm going to jump to the Old Testament to show you what the author of Hebrews is referring to.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:34.680]   And so I want that image because that's the image that's embedded in Israel's history.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.680]   Okay, so remember that.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.680]   So remember that picture.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.680]   This is God physically presenting himself to the nation of Israel.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.680]   So if you can turn the lights back on.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:49.680]   He's referring to what's taking place in Exodus and Deuteronomy.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.680]   Exodus chapter 19, 16 to 18, it says this.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   So it came about on the third day when it was morning.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.680]   If you look at that picture, you would naturally think that maybe it's dark because it's at nighttime.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.680]   He said, no, it's morning.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:05.680]   The only reason why it's dark is because he said God's presence came.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.680]   And that's not a made-up picture.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.680]   That's an accurate picture because the Bible describes darkness fell.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:16.680]   In fact, remember when we had Dr. Harris here, the darkness and the glory,
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:21.680]   he describes at the third hour when God wanted to inaugurate his new covenant,
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.680]   remember what happened, darkness fell on earth.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:32.680]   And he was veiling his glory because sinful man cannot be in the presence of this holy God.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.680]   And that's how the covenant, the first covenant of the law,
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:41.680]   when it was given, darkness and terror falls upon them in the morning.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:47.680]   That there were thunder and lightning, flashes and a thick cloud upon the mountain,
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:53.680]   and a very loud trumpet sound so that all the people were in the camp trembled.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.680]   There wasn't this celebration, God is drawing near to us, let's all gather together to go watch.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.680]   That was not what happened.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:08.680]   Soon as they saw God's glory coming upon Mount Sinai, terror falls upon them.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:12.680]   They were afraid that they're going to die because of this presence, verse 17,
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:17.680]   and Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at a foot of the mountain.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.680]   Now Mount Sinai was all the smoke because the Lord descended upon it in fire.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:29.680]   And the smoke descended like the smoke of the furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   I want you to look at the next pictures that I have up here.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:38.680]   This is an actual picture of where they believe that it's Mount Sinai.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.680]   It's in Arabia in some place.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.680]   So I don't have time to go over the details, but there's plenty of documentaries,
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.680]   or you can go on Google and look this up, YouTube, and look at videos,
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.680]   because it's well documented that they believe, and it's very convincing,
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.680]   that this is the mountain that is being referred to, Mount Sinai.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.680]   If you look at it, it looks like there's two mountains.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.680]   You have the one in the front and one in the back.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.680]   In actuality, it's the same mountain.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:09.680]   It's just that at some point, the color changes.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   The top of the mountain is black, and then at some point in the middle, it's light.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:20.680]   So it's the same mountain. Let me show you the satellite picture of that mountain.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:26.680]   And so, because secular archaeologists are also intrigued why that would be there,
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.680]   up on that mountain, because they don't see any other mountain, any of that,
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   because it's a complete desert area.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.680]   So their explanation is, at one point, there must have been a volcanic eruption
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:41.680]   that caused that mountain, just the top part of it, to be black.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.680]   So since then, they've gone up to test these rocks.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   And if you can turn to the next one, this picture you probably can't see too well,
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:54.680]   but you'll see that the top of it is dark, and then right next to it, it's more light.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.680]   And so they were able to study the rocks, and they broke it up and found out
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.680]   that it's not volcanic ash at all, because if it's volcanic,
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.680]   it should be dark all the way through.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:06.680]   It's only dark on the surface, meaning that the only logical explanation
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.680]   is something external burned these rocks, and it stayed.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.680]   So I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.680]   If you can turn the lights back on.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.680]   Now that's not directly connected to what I'm about to say,
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   but it is intriguing that we have physical evidence of all that is mentioned here.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.680]   And along with that, if you watch the documentary, they'll tell you that
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.680]   at the bottom of Mount Sinai, God made borders,
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.680]   so that they could not come up the mountain.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.680]   And at that archaeological site, they found piles and piles of rocks
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.680]   all around to make borders so they couldn't come through.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.680]   And it is at that mountain, when Moses comes up and he comes down,
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.680]   Aaron and the Israelites made an altar to the golden calf.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.680]   They found an altar at the bottom of this mountain,
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.680]   with an altar with images of golden calf on it.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.680]   And that's also the mountain where Elijah goes and hides in the cave,
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.680]   and they found that cave.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.680]   So it's very interesting.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:07.680]   So there's more than enough evidence to show that this is the mountain
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.680]   that the Bible is referring to.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.680]   And the fact that God's glory shone up up there with blazing fire,
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:19.680]   and that it burned up the mountain, and that it still remains there,
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.680]   shows you how intense this scene was.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:28.680]   Exodus 19, 12-13 says, "You shall set bounds for the people all around,
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.680]   saying, 'Beware that you do not go up on the mountain or touch the border.'"
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.680]   Remember the border that I referred to.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.680]   "Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:42.680]   No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:47.680]   Whether beast or man, he shall not live."
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.680]   His presence did not invite people to come.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   They were so terrified.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   And God actually tells them, "If you come to me, you will die,
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   you or any other beast."
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.680]   Mount Sinai was not a welcoming sight.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.680]   It caused them to fall in terror.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:10.680]   Exodus 19, 22 says, "When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder,
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   Moses spoke, and God answered him with a thunder.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.680]   The Lord came down on Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain,
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.680]   and the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.680]   Then the Lord spoke to Moses, 'Go down, warn the people,
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   so that they do not break through to the Lord's gates, and many of them perish.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.680]   Also let the priests who come near to the Lord consecrate themselves,
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.680]   or else the Lord will break out against them.'"
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:37.680]   To break out means to have disease or even death sentence.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.680]   So the priests preparing and consecrating themselves,
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:47.680]   nobody drew near to God casually because it meant death.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:51.680]   Again, in Exodus 20, 18-19, "All the people perceived the thunder
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:55.680]   and lightning flashes and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:00.680]   And when the people saw it, they trembled and stood at a distance."
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.680]   They didn't run to it, they stood at a distance.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.680]   "Then they said to Moses, 'Speak to us yourself, and we will listen,
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.680]   but let not God speak to us, or we will die.'"
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.680]   If you remember the scene when Moses is up in the mountain,
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.680]   as God is commanding him to lead the nation of Israel,
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.680]   he says, "Let me see your glory."
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.680]   And God says, "If I show you my full glory, you will die.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:26.680]   But because you have asked," he says, "I'm going to cover you,
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:27.680]   and I'm going to pass by.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.680]   So you're going to see a glimpse of my glory, partial glory,
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.680]   as I pass by, not my full glory."
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.680]   But that glory, that reflection of that glory of God,
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.680]   as he is protected, as he's passing by,
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.680]   was reflecting on the face of Moses.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.680]   And when he came down and started to speak to the nation of Israel,
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:52.680]   they were terrified just by the reflection of that glory on Moses' face.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.680]   So they beg him, "Go into the tent.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.680]   Speak to us through the tent.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:01.680]   Put a veil on you," because they were terrified of his presence
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.680]   and his very voice.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:08.680]   Again, in Deuteronomy 5, 24-27, you said,
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:12.680]   "Behold, the Lord our God has shown us his glory and his greatness,
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.680]   and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:20.680]   We have seen today that God speaks with man, yet he lives," referring to Moses.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.680]   Now, why should we die, for this great fire will consume us?
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.680]   You see how, talking about God's fire,
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.680]   they didn't automatically think, like, "Oh, if we go there, we're going to live."
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.680]   They said, "If we go to God, we're going to die."
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.680]   That's what the Jews saw.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.680]   That's what they were thinking.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.680]   If we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer, then we will die.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.680]   If we keep hearing from God, we're going to die.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.680]   Think about that from the New Covenant perspective in Western Christianity,
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.680]   how the gospel is introduced to us.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.680]   God loves you, has a wonderful plan for your life.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:01.680]   And so whenever we hear anything harsh, we automatically,
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.680]   "This doesn't fit the gospel that I know."
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.680]   Whenever there's a warning about God's holiness,
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.680]   it's like, "It doesn't fit the gospel that I know,
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.680]   but it's the gospel of the Bible,"
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:18.680]   because the starting point in the Western church doesn't allow the judgment of God.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:22.680]   But yet, Mount Sinai, it is clear.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.680]   It is clear in the Scripture, because this is the way God presented himself.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.680]   Verse 26, "For who is there of all flesh
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.680]   who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire,
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.680]   as we have, and lived?
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.680]   Go near and hear all that the Lord our God says,
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.680]   then speak to us all that the Lord our God speaks to you,
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:43.680]   and we will hear it and do it."
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:47.680]   You know, when I was in college, I was a Bible major,
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.680]   so I spent four years in undergrad studying the Bible.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:55.680]   Then after I graduated, I went to seminary and spent a couple more years studying the Bible.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.680]   So a minimum of six years I was studying the Bible.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.680]   So when I came out, obviously I thought I have a good grasp of the Bible,
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.680]   learned systematic theology, how to do exegesis,
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.680]   went through the different parts of Scripture.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.680]   But it wasn't until I started preaching through the Bible
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:16.680]   I realized how superficial my understanding of the gospel was.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.680]   I started, first of all, and the reason why I started preaching through the Bible
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.680]   wasn't because of an example that I saw or somebody told me that that's the way to preach.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:27.680]   I just ran out of material.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.680]   You know, after preaching three, four years topically,
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.680]   every week the greatest struggle was, "What am I going to say about discipleship this week?
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.680]   What am I going to say about lordship?
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.680]   What am I going to say about prayer? What am I going to say about word?"
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.680]   So after about three years of preaching with the same group,
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.680]   either I have to move church because I ran out of material,
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.680]   or I'm going to have to repeat these same sermons over and over again.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:54.680]   And then I remember Chuck Smith, I was listening to a seminar,
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.680]   and they said, "We're just going to preach the Bible.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.680]   We're just going to open up the Bible in 1 Timothy."
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.680]   And so I said, "Yeah, that sounds good."
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.680]   And I remember very distinctly I started with the Gospel of John.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.680]   After that I moved to the Philippines, and then I went to Galatians,
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.680]   and then I started studying 1 and 2 John,
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:16.680]   and then I went to study the Book of Romans, and then to Hebrews,
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.680]   and eventually I made it through the majority of the New Testament,
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.680]   and then I started jumping through the Old Testament
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.680]   because I was running out in the New Testament,
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.680]   and then I just started preaching through the Old Testament.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.680]   And it wasn't until about four or five years into the study,
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.680]   systematically, verse by verse, through book by book,
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:36.680]   and I began to realize my theology has completely started to change.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:41.680]   And the primary thing that was starting to really be highlighted,
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:47.680]   even after six years of Bible education at seminary,
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:51.680]   was God's nature of His holiness.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.680]   And I really felt like I got punched in the face, like,
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.680]   "Of course I knew God was holy."
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.680]   If you take systematic theology, you talk about the attribute of God,
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.680]   holiness is always on the top.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.680]   So it wasn't that I wasn't taught.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.680]   It wasn't that I didn't hear sermons.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:12.680]   But to the degree that the Bible punches you in the face about this attribute,
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:17.680]   and how every other attribute, everything that I know about the Bible and the Gospel,
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.680]   stems from understanding Mount Sinai.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:24.680]   It stems from understanding the law, why the law was given,
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:30.680]   and proper view of who God is, and in view of that, who I am.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.680]   Part of the reason why we wrestle,
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.680]   and why I have so much problem in the Western church,
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.680]   and again, this is not unique to the Western church,
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:42.680]   but part of the reason why is because we're still at the center.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:49.680]   We view God as a supreme being who is so enamored with us,
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.680]   that even though we won't articulate it that way, but He's our servant.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:59.680]   And so we receive Him and reject Him based upon what He does for me.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.680]   What has He done for me?
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:04.680]   And so we evaluate churches that way.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.680]   What does the church do for me?
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.680]   What does this small group have to do for me?
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.680]   What do these leadership have to do for me?
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.680]   Because we're still at the center.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:18.680]   Mount Sinai totally obliterates all of that.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:23.680]   Because the whole purpose of the law is to teach us that you are dead in your trespasses,
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.680]   and so that you may see how utterly sinful you are.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.680]   That was the purpose of Mount Sinai.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.680]   And that's exactly how it is described.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.680]   So you remember, Israel's history was God in heaven.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   They were speaking to Him, and all of a sudden He comes to Mount Sinai.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:42.680]   And this is the closest that the Israelites have ever seen Him physically.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.680]   They heard Him from a distance.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.680]   They were told through the patriarchs.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:53.680]   But now they're seeing a physical picture, and the first encounter with Him is absolute terror.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:56.680]   Absolute terror.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:02.680]   So imagine that that God that they saw at Mount Sinai,
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:06.680]   now at the end of Exodus, say, "I'm going to come near.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:10.680]   I told you you can't even come to the bottom of the mountain, but I'm going to come.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:14.680]   Set up the tabernacle, because I'm coming."
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:18.680]   The tabernacle was not a community center.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.680]   So if the Israelites were afraid to even hear His voice,
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:28.680]   can you imagine what this did to the nation of Israel when God said, "I'm going to come to that tabernacle"?
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:32.680]   If a God that I saw from a distance terrified me,
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:36.680]   and God set it up so that all 12 tribes were equal distance to this tabernacle.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:41.680]   And this tabernacle at the Holy of Holies
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.680]   was a concentrated presence of God that they saw from a distance,
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:48.680]   where they didn't even want to hear from Him.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.680]   Imagine what that did to the nation of Israel.
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.680]   That's why in 2 Corinthians 3, 7 and verse 9,
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:59.680]   Apostle Paul calls the ministry of Mount Sinai as ministry of death,
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   and ministry of condemnation.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:09.680]   I guarantee you, nobody casually came to the tabernacle.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.680]   Because the tabernacle reminded them of death.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:17.680]   Can you imagine how bloody this scene was?
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:22.680]   And if you've ever seen a physical set up of a tabernacle,
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.680]   or just imagine how big.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.680]   The tabernacle was not huge. It was not the size of a city.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:30.680]   It was probably the size of maybe our building.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.680]   It was not huge.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.680]   And they had to constantly sacrifice, day after day,
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:40.680]   for every sin committed by over a million people.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:44.680]   So you can imagine how many animals were being slaughtered.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.680]   Every day that they smelled the animals.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.680]   Every day they saw the blood flow.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.680]   And all of this reminded them, this is what you deserve.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:55.680]   You come here, this is what you deserve.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.680]   So the tabernacle was not a welcoming place.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:03.680]   And God deliberately showed this to mankind, to Israel.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.680]   And that's why the author of Hebrews is telling them,
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:10.680]   you can draw near because God's not calling you to Sinai.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:14.680]   Because if He calls you to Sinai, you will die.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.680]   You need to understand what Sinai is,
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:21.680]   so that we can understand what Zion is.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.680]   There's a reason why it says in Proverbs 8.10,
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:28.680]   "Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:33.680]   In the Western world, if you grew up in the Western church,
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.680]   and you've heard the gospels exclusively through the Western pulpit,
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.680]   you've probably heard at some point,
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.680]   the fear is not referring to terror.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.680]   The fear He's referring to is talking about reverence and honor.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.680]   That's probably what you heard.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.680]   Because the terrified presence of God
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:53.680]   doesn't fit the gospel of the Western church.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.680]   Because He loves you, has a wonderful plan for your life.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.680]   No matter what you do, He forgives you.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.680]   And so because we've exclusively heard the gospel that way,
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.680]   it doesn't fit our paradigm.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:07.680]   So the way that it is described is,
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.680]   He's not talking about being terrified in the presence of God.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:13.680]   He's talking about honor and reverence.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.680]   Well guess what?
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.680]   That's exactly what it means, to be terrified.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:21.680]   To be terrified of the presence of God is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.680]   Why is the fear of the Lord the beginning of wisdom?
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:28.680]   Because the fear of the Lord is the beginning of our salvation.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:32.680]   Until you recognize who it is that we have offended,
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:37.680]   until you recognize who it is that you will meet outside of the blood of Christ,
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.680]   and there is no terror,
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:42.680]   then there's no need for the gospel.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.680]   The beginning of wisdom, the beginning of salvation,
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.680]   is recognizing that the one that we have offended
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.680]   is that God of Mount Sinai.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:57.680]   They couldn't even hear His voice.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.680]   And that's why He says in Matthew 10, 28,
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:05.680]   "Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul,
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:11.680]   but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:14.680]   Does that sound like reverence to you?
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:16.680]   Does that sound like honor?
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:19.680]   Like that's what He said, "No, fear, honor Him who can kill you in hell."
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.680]   Does that sound like...
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:24.680]   No, that's terror.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:29.680]   Think about how often we make decisions and we compromise
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:33.680]   because we're afraid of what other people are going to think of us.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:38.680]   We're afraid of the consequence in this earth.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.680]   But He said if you're going to be terrified in anything,
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:43.680]   be terrified where you really should be terrified.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.680]   Not only is there a consequence physically,
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:50.680]   but there's consequence in eternity who can send you to hell.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.680]   So you're going to be terrified.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:54.680]   If any fear is going to guide you in your decision,
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.680]   if any fear is going to cause you to make certain decisions and live a certain way,
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:01.680]   make sure it's the fear of the Lord.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:06.680]   That's why Mount Sinai is essential in understanding Zion.
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:09.680]   Without understanding, grace is just a free gift.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:10.680]   It's just like Halloween.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.680]   They're giving you candy for free.
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:14.680]   You did nothing.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   That's why when Apostle Paul introduces the gospel in Romans 1,
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:25.680]   he says the wrath of God is being revealed against all unrighteousness.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:29.680]   The wrath of God.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:32.680]   R.C. Sproul describes the word wrath in Greek as orge,
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:37.680]   where we get the word orgy, is unbridled passion.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.680]   No self-control.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.680]   That's where the word comes from.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:46.680]   And he describes the word wrath there as God without constraint, without mercy.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:51.680]   He is unleashing his anger towards sinners.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:58.680]   He says that in the end, all that we have seen about the wrath and the terror of God,
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:06.680]   all of that, all of that was tempered because he knew his son was coming.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:10.680]   But on the day of judgment, all of that will be behind.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:13.680]   And we have a tendency to think, again,
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:17.680]   the idea of hell doesn't fit Western Christianity.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:21.680]   So the way that hell is described is hell is a place where God withdraws himself.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:24.680]   There's no presence of God at all.
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:26.680]   So you're kind of like washing his hands.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:27.680]   Oh, God's not guilty of hell.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:28.680]   You deserve that you go there.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.680]   But God kind of withdraw.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:33.680]   That's not how the Bible describes hell.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:36.680]   Hell is a place where the grace of God has been withdrawn.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:42.680]   It is the full display of his glory without constraint,
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:45.680]   without the covering of the blood of Christ.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:49.680]   So heaven is a place where we see the full degree of his grace.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:55.680]   And hell is a place where we see the full degree of his glory in his wrath.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:02.680]   And both places is magnificent and terrifying because of God.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:06.680]   That's why John Newton says in his song, "Amazing Grace,"
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:11.680]   "Twas grace that taught my heart to fear."
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:13.680]   He's like, "Oh, because we're under grace, there's no fear in our hearts."
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:18.680]   He said, "No, it's the grace of God that caused me to fear."
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:22.680]   Because it's the fear of the Lord that is the beginning of salvation.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:27.680]   And it was grace my fears relieved.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:31.680]   Charles Spurgeon, in his autobiography, has a whole chapter dedicated
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:37.680]   to saying God's law tormented him before he came to saving faith in Christ.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:42.680]   It was because he understood what it meant to be in the presence of God
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:45.680]   by the law that drove him to Christ.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:50.680]   Martin Luther, the whole Reformation, Protestantism,
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.680]   it's based upon this man.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:56.680]   And he describes his salvation as hating righteousness,
[00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.680]   recognizing that he could not appease God with the law,
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:06.680]   which caused him to see that that's what grace was.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:10.680]   Rob Bell wrote a book called "Erasing Hell."
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:15.680]   And it's because his idea of the gospel doesn't fit hell.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.680]   How can God be fair if he allows hell?
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.680]   Why would God do that?
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:25.680]   Again, the reason why it doesn't fit him is because his very understanding of the gospel,
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:30.680]   his very understanding of God himself, he fell asleep.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:34.680]   He doesn't realize the primary person that has been offended is not the world,
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:38.680]   is not Satan, it's God himself.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.680]   When we are in fear, who do we run to?
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:47.680]   When we're younger, we'll run to mom or dad because we assume that they can protect us.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.680]   So if you go to a playground and there's a bully, we run to mom and dad because mom and dad's bigger.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.680]   And so you feel safe.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.680]   When we grow up, we're stronger than our parents at some point,
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.680]   so we can't run to them, so we run to the police.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.680]   So they come with their guns.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.680]   Or maybe they're too far, so you'll buy a gun.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.680]   Whatever that may be, fear of something that may harm us,
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.680]   so when we are afraid, we go to something bigger and stronger to protect us.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.680]   But here's the dilemma of mankind.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:24.680]   What caused the greatest fear and greatest terror was God himself.
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.680]   So who do you run to if God's the one that you're afraid of?
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.680]   Where do you run when you see God coming,
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:38.680]   knowing that that's where life is, but that's also where I'm going to be destroyed?
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.680]   Oh, what a wretched man that I am.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.680]   Where do I run from? Where do I go to?
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:51.680]   If God's the one that causes the greatest terror,
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:55.680]   we've heard the gospel through the Western channels where God has been presented
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.680]   because we're marketing the gospel to get as many people through the door.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.680]   And the deception of Western Christianity is that so many people have come through the door
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:10.680]   not knowing who God is, and when Jesus says, "They will say, 'Lord, Lord,'"
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.680]   and He says, "I never knew you. You didn't know me."
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.680]   That's how He was going to describe, "You did not know me."
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.680]   You regurgitated the gospel. You said the right things, but you didn't know me
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.680]   because they did not understand Mount Sinai.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:31.680]   He's not unconditionally in love with rebellious sinners.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:38.680]   He is holy, wrathful, angry, and vengeful.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.680]   Yeah, vengeful. That's what it says. That's what the Bible says.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:45.680]   Leave room for the vengeance of God.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:53.680]   So if your paradigm was created simply by the New Testament preaching of the gospel,
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:58.680]   and you jump through all the difficulty, "I don't want to know this wrathful God.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.680]   I don't want to know this scary God. I want to get to the new God of the New Testament,"
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:09.680]   you can easily miss what Christ has done on the cross.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:16.680]   That's why Isaiah 6, verse 5, this holy man, as he is being prepared to be sent out to represent God,
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:22.680]   it wasn't enough that he got the message correct. He needed to know who God is.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:28.680]   It's not enough that you study, then you can regurgitate and tell you, "I got this, and then I'm presenting it to you."
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.680]   A representative of God needs to properly understand God Himself.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:38.680]   That's why God doesn't just give him the words. God reveals His glory.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:46.680]   As soon as he's in the presence of God, in Isaiah chapter 6, verse 5, he says, "Woe is me. Woe is me."
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:52.680]   You know what the word "woe" means? Literally, it means, "I'm undone. I'm dead."
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:58.680]   That's what that means. "I'm dead. I'm not going to survive this." That's what that means.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:05.680]   And this is a man that God handpicked to represent Him, and His response in the presence of God is, "I am dead.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.680]   I'm a man of unclean lips from the people of unclean lips."
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:12.680]   Meaning, He knew that He was being called to open His mouth to present God.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:18.680]   But how can I use this dirty mouth to present this? That's what He meant.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:23.680]   So fear and terror fell upon Him. And it's not just Isaiah.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:29.680]   In every instance, whether it was the disciples, John in the book of Revelation,
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:35.680]   elders at the throne of God, the angels, the holy creatures,
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:41.680]   in the presence of this holy God, covering their eyes to veil themselves from His glory
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:45.680]   because they were terrified of His presence, were circling His throne saying,
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:50.680]   "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty."
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:05:01.680]   Every instance that a human being, a sinner in the presence of this holy God, is terrified.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.680]   But that's what He means that you did not come to Mount Sinai.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:12.680]   Because to a first century Jew, they didn't have to be taught to be terrified by God.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:15.680]   Their whole experience with God was terrifying.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.680]   There's a reason why they wouldn't pronounce His name.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:24.680]   And if you read the Old Testament, they changed His name Yahweh to Adonai
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.680]   because they were afraid that they were going to break one of His commandments
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.680]   to use His name in vain.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.680]   So He said, "Just in case." I don't know if that's what God meant,
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.680]   but just in case, we don't want to mess with the law.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:39.680]   I remember Adab and Nebihu, God gave them specific instructions
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.680]   and they didn't follow strictly.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:47.680]   And because of that, the holy fire comes and consumes them and they die.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:51.680]   So imagine, so you know what, we're not going to get this wrong.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.680]   We're not even going to pronounce His name.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:59.680]   So to this day, you probably heard the name Jehovah, Yahweh.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.680]   You know why we have Yahweh and Jehovah?
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.680]   Because the Hebrew language doesn't have vowels.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.680]   And they didn't pronounce it for so many years.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.680]   We're guessing, is it Yahweh or is it Jehovah?
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.680]   I think more people lean toward Yahweh.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:20.680]   But that's the reason why we have Jehovah and Yahweh.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.680]   You didn't have to tell first century Jew,
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:28.680]   have reverence, be terrified, take this seriously.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.680]   In fact, they have to be told exactly the opposite.
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.680]   God's not calling you to Sinai.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.680]   He's calling you to Zion.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.680]   We'll talk about that next week.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.680]   But remember the progression, the whole progression of the gospel
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.680]   is God from heaven coming to Mount Sinai.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.680]   And then that terrifying view of Sinai, God says,
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.680]   I'm going to come in the tabernacle, get ready.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.680]   So you better believe they took every command seriously.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.680]   Touching of the poles, presenting the measurements,
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.680]   where they're supposed to go, where they're not supposed to go,
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.680]   what sacrifices they're supposed to make,
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.680]   what sacrifices they're not supposed to make.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.680]   And they bring a tainted animal, and as a result of that, they die.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.680]   And they break any commandment, they would die.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.680]   So it wasn't just, oh, we made a mistake, God forgives us.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:19.680]   No, if you did that, you came and touched the holy things
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.680]   when you're not supposed to touch it.
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:28.680]   So I guarantee you people did not casually come into the tabernacle.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.680]   My guess is every time they needed to go to the tabernacle,
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.680]   they probably had a meeting in their family.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.680]   And maybe they probably didn't take their children either,
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.680]   because just in case any of the kids run into a place
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.680]   where they're not supposed to go, and they die.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.680]   They probably prepared.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.680]   When we go there, here are the instructions.
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.680]   We're supposed to wait outside.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.680]   The priest is supposed to come. He's supposed to lay his hands.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.680]   We only go in where they tell us.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.680]   We only speak when they tell us to speak.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.680]   When it's time to leave, we leave.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.680]   And when the priests say to come, we come.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.680]   When they tell to go, we go.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.680]   Everybody get that? Everybody get that?
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:09.680]   Presence of the tabernacle was so terrifying.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:16.680]   My guess is that they took that very, very seriously.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.680]   That's why at that tabernacle, when they went to the temple,
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:26.680]   and from the temple, he sent this Holy Spirit in us.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:32.680]   And then that Spirit that is in us, that they were so terrified of,
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.680]   he says, "Now you are the temple of God."
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:40.680]   And that's what Apostle Paul means in Corinthians 3 and 6.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.680]   You have a church who is divided, not taking sin seriously.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:47.680]   Worship is in chaos.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:50.680]   Do you not know that you are the temple of God,
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.680]   and the Spirit of God dwells in you?
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.680]   So when a Jew heard this, that terrifying scene,
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.680]   that terrifying God,
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.680]   that God that you were so afraid of in tabernacle,
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.680]   He's in you now.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.680]   It would have created terror in them,
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.680]   realizing that they are the temple of God,
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:17.680]   individually and collectively.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:21.680]   You see, somebody who does not understand this
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:27.680]   is not going to understand the weightiness of worship.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.680]   Worship is somewhere we come, we sing some songs,
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.680]   and then it's how far is the church.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.680]   We've made it so casual, make it easy as possible,
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.680]   and as a result of marketing the church,
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:42.680]   we have this weightiness of what it is that God has called us to do,
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.680]   and most people don't understand in our generation
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.680]   that we're approaching a holy, holy, holy God.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.680]   And the only reason why you and I are not consumed
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:56.680]   is because if you're a child of God, we are covered by the blood of Christ.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.680]   And the only one that could have saved us from that wrath of God,
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.680]   that terrifying scene of God,
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:05.680]   was His only begotten Son.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.680]   And it is that that covers it, that that He's referring to in Mount Zion.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:16.680]   People ask me, "Why do you keep wearing a suit?"
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.680]   I've had people tell me, "This is California, hang loose, man.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.680]   Relax."
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:27.680]   I know, I know I look like a fuddy-duddy.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.680]   Short and stocky people don't look good in anything.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.680]   I'm very aware of my physical presence.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.680]   I'm very aware.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.680]   It's not because of fashion.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.680]   In fact, I don't like it. I like being comfortable.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:47.680]   I wear it because I recognize what it is that God has called me to do.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.680]   And it's really preparing my own heart.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.680]   That's why I don't give you my opinions.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.680]   And I'll tell you, if it's my opinion, I'll tell you it's my opinion.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.680]   Because this is not my pulpit.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:05.680]   I've been called to declare what the Bible says, even if it offends you.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.680]   Even if you hate me for it.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.680]   Before I am your servant, I am His servant.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:16.680]   And so I want to make sure that what I do physically, mentally, and spiritually
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:20.680]   reflects what God has called me to do.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:23.680]   It really is not much different for you.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.680]   That calling is not just for me.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:32.680]   As a church called to the presence of God, we don't have dress codes at our church.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:35.680]   Because I don't think saying you have to wear this and you've got to do this,
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.680]   that doesn't make it reverent.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:43.680]   But I encourage you to examine when we come to church,
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:48.680]   do we recognize the God that we came to worship?
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.680]   Are we coming to church because it's just a gathering for me?
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.680]   What am I going to get? Is the sermon going to be good for me?
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:59.680]   How much of our attitude reflects the God, the almighty, holy, holy God
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:05.680]   that we have come to honor and thank for covering us with the blood of Christ?
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:10.680]   Somebody who doesn't understand Mount Sinai takes his own sin lightly.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.680]   One saved, always saved.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:16.680]   Our whole doctrine is based upon a cliche, a bumper sticker.
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:20.680]   Christians are not perfect but forgiven.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.680]   So our whole understanding of salvation is by a bumper sticker,
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:28.680]   or for cliches, or little things, or blogs that we've heard.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:33.680]   A man or woman who doesn't understand who God is takes his sin lightly.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:36.680]   Takes the word of God lightly.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.680]   Because not recognizing that this is his very breath that we are handling.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.680]   We're not the perverted to say whatever,
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:50.680]   add to it or take away from it, do not turn from it to the left or to the right.
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.680]   And a man or woman who does not understand who God is takes the church lightly.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.680]   Church becomes a place where it serves me.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.680]   What does it do for me?
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:02.680]   We're at the center. We don't exit. We never say this out loud.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:06.680]   But that's our present. Everything is evaluated based upon what does it do for me?
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.680]   Not realizing this is the temple of God.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.680]   I guarantee you nobody walks into the tabernacle saying,
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:14.680]   "The priests, they're not reaching out to me."
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:17.680]   I guarantee you nobody walked into the tabernacle thinking,
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.680]   "Oh, the altar is too far."
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.680]   They came in making sure that they followed the rule,
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.680]   that they don't offend this holy God.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:36.680]   The church is the temple where God dwells collectively in us.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.680]   Is our casual nature toward church and worship
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:43.680]   a reflection of a wrong view of God?
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:49.680]   Do we take the collective coming into the presence of God as if it's convenient?
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.680]   Is it inconvenient?
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:55.680]   Does it actually reflect who God is?
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.680]   1 Peter 3.18, it says, "For Christ also died for sins once for all,
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:03.680]   the just for the unjust."
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.680]   Think about that.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:10.680]   With all the yelling and screaming and marching and rioting about wanting justice,
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:18.680]   but the greatest injustice that the world has ever seen is Christ crucified.
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:22.680]   Because the only innocent man who died,
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:28.680]   the only true innocent man who died, died for unjust sinners.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.680]   We come to celebrate injustice.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.680]   We are saved because of injustice.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.680]   We serve him, we worship him because of the greatest injustice
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:44.680]   that has been carried out by God the Father
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:49.680]   so he can dwell among us.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:53.680]   Just for the unjust so that he might bring us to God,
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:59.680]   having been put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit.
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:05.680]   Let me--I want to end with a practical application.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.680]   There's reasons why we have--as you're walking through,
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.680]   I don't know how many of you guys noticed, there's essential books.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:14.680]   We have three essential books that we ask all our members to read.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:19.680]   And the reason behind it, Holiness of God, R.C. Sproul.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:25.680]   Now, I rarely recommend books because I'd rather have you be saturated with God's Word.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:28.680]   But we recommend this as fundamental in the church
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:32.680]   because Holiness of God changes the paradigm
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.680]   that Western Christianity has about who God is.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:40.680]   He's not a holy bellhop servant like we call him and then he comes running,
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.680]   "Oh, he didn't answer my prayer." Maybe God's not real because he doesn't serve us.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.680]   This changes that paradigm.
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:50.680]   I think R.C. Sproul does the best job that I've read
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.680]   in helping us to change that paradigm.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.680]   So even if you read it, if you read it superficially
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.680]   or you didn't really digest it, I highly recommend
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.680]   not just to read it but digest this.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.680]   And any part of it that you don't understand,
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.680]   go back and read it and ask questions.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.680]   So this is a must.
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.680]   The second thing is the Gospel According to Jesus.
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.680]   Now, there are other books that you can read for this,
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.680]   but I think he does the best job on this.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.680]   Gospel According to Jesus, knowing who God is
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.680]   helps us to understand what the gospel is
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.680]   and what the gospel does.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.680]   It's not just like God just like, "Oh, you know what?
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.680]   I took sin very seriously, but since my son died,
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.680]   I don't care about sin anymore in the New Testament."
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:33.680]   Again, that's Western Christianity.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.680]   I'm knocking on the Western Christianity,
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.680]   but this is true probably of everywhere else.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.680]   That's just where I am, so that's what I'm referring to.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.680]   But this helps us to understand,
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.680]   what does salvation look like?
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.680]   What does a sinner who's been covered by the blood of Christ
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:53.680]   having a personal relationship with this Holy God look like?
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.680]   That's what this book helps us to understand.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.680]   He just goes through passage after passage,
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.680]   parable after parable, to help us to understand,
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.680]   not as superficial as, "Oh, God loves,
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:05.680]   I had a wonderful plan for your life, forgive it!"
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.680]   He goes detail.
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.680]   And so, again, this is why this is essential.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.680]   So if you don't understand this or maybe disagree with this,
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.680]   you're probably going to have a lot of problems
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.680]   with the way that I preach.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.680]   You're going to have a lot of problems with the way
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.680]   that we present the Bible.
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.680]   Because you either don't understand this
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.680]   or you don't agree with it.
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:26.680]   So this will help you at least understand
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:29.680]   why the preaching and teaching is a certain way at our church,
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:30.680]   because we believe this to be true.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.680]   And the third one is also from MacArthur.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.680]   And there are other books that you can read on this,
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.680]   but we think he does the most thorough job
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.680]   on what the biblical church looks like.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.680]   Because if the church is a temple of God,
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.680]   we're going to want to know that he didn't just say,
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.680]   "Gather together and just figure it out,
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.680]   "and face the lost, and try to figure out how to do it."
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.680]   He didn't do that.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.680]   Imagine that God, who gave so much intricate details
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.680]   how the tabernacle and temple was to be built,
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.680]   did not build a New Testament church
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.680]   and say, "You just figure it out."
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.680]   It's inconsistent with the God that we know,
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.680]   the Old Testament, and God didn't do that.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:07.680]   He gave us intricate details of what we ought to follow,
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.680]   what the church should look like,
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:10.680]   standards of an elder,
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.680]   how to discipline when people are in sin.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.680]   And so all of these things are described in the New Testament
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.680]   that we just kind of give broad strokes.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.680]   And so if we're going to approach this holy God,
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.680]   even though we're covered by the blood of Christ,
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:23.680]   we need to properly understand
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:25.680]   what the Bible teaches about the church.
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.680]   What does he desire?
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:30.680]   Because this is the body of Christ.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:32.680]   So if we're going to build a church that honors God,
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.680]   we have to figure out how to honor God
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:36.680]   the way he tells us to honor God.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.680]   And I think he does the best job in doing this.
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:41.680]   So this is probably one of the more drier versions,
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.680]   because if you're looking for a novel to fall asleep,
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.680]   you know, like to revive you,
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.680]   you're going to require to be committed to this
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.680]   and try to understand, wrestle with this.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:56.680]   And again, the reason why we practice church membership,
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:59.680]   the reason why we're so slow in establishing leadership
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.680]   in our church,
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.680]   and why we have certain things that we do,
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:05.680]   it all helps you to understand it from this book.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.680]   So these are the three essential books, right,
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:10.680]   that we encourage you to read
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.680]   because it'll help you to understand your faith,
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:14.680]   but it also helps you to understand
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.680]   what we're trying to do at church.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:20.680]   And all of this so that we do not turn from his word
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:23.680]   to the left or to the right,
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.680]   that we don't view God based upon the prejudices
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.680]   that we've gained.
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:30.680]   That's fair and not fair.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:34.680]   So much of Christianity is evaluated, received,
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:38.680]   and rejected based upon what we think is fair.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:43.680]   When we do that, we place ourselves above God.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.680]   If God is truly king,
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:50.680]   even if every part of us says it's unfair,
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:55.680]   I trust God over my own judgment, right?
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:00.680]   All of this is so that we can understand Zion better
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.680]   because we did not come to Zion with Sinai.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.680]   God is not calling us to Sinai.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:09.680]   Sinai was to better help us understand
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.680]   what it is that we have in Christ,
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:13.680]   and we'll get to that next week.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:15.680]   Let's pray.
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:25.680]   Let's take a few minutes as, again, our worship team comes
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.680]   to allow the word of God to dwell in us richly,
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:33.680]   to not to superficially follow Christ from a distance,
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:36.680]   that the Christ and the gospel that we profess
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:39.680]   isn't something that I've chosen to accept
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:43.680]   because it makes more sense to me,
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.680]   but the God that I worship is the God of the Bible.
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.680]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.680]   [music]
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:58.680]   [music]

[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:22.360]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your mercy and for your grace.
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:27.360]   I pray that the weight of your words
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.360]   would impact more than just our thoughts,
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:34.360]   our feelings, but our very lives.
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:37.360]   I pray, Father God, that as you promised,
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.360]   that your word would go forth and will not return
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.360]   until it has accomplished its purpose.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:45.360]   Sanctify us, renew us, revive us,
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:49.360]   so that we would live for eternity and not for temporal things.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.360]   Help us, Lord God, to long,
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:55.360]   to long for the presence of Christ, Lord God,
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:58.360]   as he is our mediator, Lord, in the new covenant.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:02.360]   Lord, I pray that you would richly bless us this week,
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.360]   that we may magnify you in every way, in word and deed.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:08.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
