[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.640]   Guilty pair bowed down with care, God gave His Son to win.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:29.040]   His erring child He reconciled and pardoned from His sin.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:42.240]   When years of time shall pass away, and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:55.360]   when men who hear refuse to pray on rocks and hills and mountains call,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:08.560]   God's love so sure shall still endure, though measureless and strong.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:20.000]   Redeeming grace to Adam's race, the saints and angels.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:35.040]   Oh love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:54.000]   It shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels song.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:17.920]   Okay, let's go from the saints and angels song into verse three.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:27.760]   The saints and angels song.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:40.880]   Could we with ink the ocean fill, and were the skies of parchment made?
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:51.920]   Were every stock on earth acquired, and every man a scribe?
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.120]   No, no, no, no. You start by trade. By trade.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   Every man a scribe by trade.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   To write the love of God above.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.120]   Let's try that. Were every stock.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:25.120]   Were every stock on earth acquired, and every man a scribe by trade?
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:39.120]   To write the love of God above. Would drain the ocean dry.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.120]   Nor could the scroll contain the whole.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:04:05.120]   Nor stretch from sky to sky. Oh love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:17.120]   It shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels song.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:31.120]   Oh love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:45.120]   It shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels song.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.120]   Don't drop out. The first chorus is loud and the second chorus is soft. Okay?
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.120]   Capisce.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:09.120]   Alright. I think we're good. I think we're good. Alright.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.120]   Right after the second chorus.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.120]   My God is a bitch.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.120]   A bitch.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:33.120]   We're good. We're good.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   She's with him since.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:06:07.120]   She's with him since.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:17.120]   She's with him since.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:37.120]   She's with him since.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:47.120]   She's with him since.

[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:17.120]   She's with him since.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:27.120]   She's with him since.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:37.120]   She's with him since.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:51.120]   She's with him since.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:08:13.120]   She's with him since.

[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:37.120]   >> So the next prayer topic will be God's love.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:48.120]   And to guide our thoughts through this topic, I'm just going to read Psalm 103, verse 1 through 8, which says, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:47:04.120]   Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of his benefits, who pardons all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with loving kindness and compassion, who satisfies your years with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle.
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:09.120]   The Lord performs righteous deeds and judgments for all who are oppressed.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:13.120]   The Lord is gracious to Moses, his acts to the sons of Israel.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:19.120]   The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in loving kindness."
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:24.120]   I'll just pray for us over this topic.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:30.120]   Dear God, we want to take this time to thank you for your great love for us.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:35.120]   Lord, we confess before you that we are people who are sinful to the core.
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:39.120]   We are people who are not worthy of your love.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:42.120]   We are people who are not worthy of your love.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.120]   We are people who are not worthy of your mercy.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:48:02.120]   But because of who you are, because of your great love, you have reached down to us when we were your enemies, and you've given your son to die on our behalf so that we could be rescued from our sin and that we could have a personal relationship with you.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:15.120]   We ask that you would give us the understanding of your love for us and that our love for you will grow as well, and that this love will fill our hearts so that we can show it to others the way that Christ has loved us.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:30.120]   Lord, we know that we can't do this without your help, without your grace, so we ask that you will remind us tonight of this love that you have for us and that this truth will transform us in our hearts so that we will be people who are known by our love for one another.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   Thank you, and we ask these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.120]   Why don't we all stand?
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:52.120]   And just like what Pastor Mark said, feel free to take some time to pray and reflect also on the great love that God has shown us.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:49:15.120]   [Music]
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:26.120]   No eye has seen, and no ear has heard, and no mind has ever conceived
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:39.120]   the glorious things that you have prepared for everyone who has been weak.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:51.120]   You brought us here, and you called us love, and made us join as with your Son.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:50:03.120]   How high as your Word, how deep as your love, how sweet and how strong is your love.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:14.120]   How lavish your grace, how faithful your ways, how great is your love, oh Lord.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:22.120]   [Music]
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.120]   Objects of mercy.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:36.120]   Objects of mercy who should have known wrath were filled with unspeakable joy.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:48.120]   Witches of wisdom, unsearchable wealth, and the wonder of knowing your voice.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:51:00.120]   You are our treasure and our great reward, our hope and our glorious King.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:12.120]   How high as your Word, how deep as your love, how sweet and how strong is your love.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:24.120]   How lavish your grace, how faithful your ways, how great is your love, oh Lord.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:30.120]   How great is your love, oh Lord.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:47.120]   [Music]
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:52:00.120]   The love of God is greater far than tongue or pen can ever tell.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:13.120]   It goes beyond the highest star and reaches to the lowest hell.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:20.120]   The guilty pair bow down with care.
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:43.120]   God gave his Son to win. His erring child he reconciled and pardoned from his sin.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:56.120]   When years of time shall pass away and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:09.120]   When men who hear refuse to pray on rocks and hills and mountains call.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:22.120]   God's love so sure shall still endure all measureless and strong.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:35.120]   Redeeming grace to Adam's race, the saints and angels sing.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:48.120]   Oh love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:54:01.120]   It shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels song.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:04.120]   [Music]
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:11.120]   Could we with ink the ocean fill?
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:18.120]   And were the skies of parchment made?
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:24.120]   Were every stalk on earth a quill?
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:31.120]   And every man a scribe by trade?
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:44.120]   To write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:57.120]   Nor could the scroll contain the whole, though stretched from sky to sky.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:10.120]   Oh love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:23.120]   It shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels song.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:37.120]   Oh love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:52.120]   It shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels song.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:55.120]   You may be seated.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:11.120]   Hi, I'm going to read a passage from Psalm 51.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:15.120]   It says, "Be gracious to me, O God, according to your loving kindness.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:19.120]   According to your greatness of your compassion, blot out my transgressions.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:23.120]   Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:27.120]   For I know my transgressions and my sin is ever before me.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:32.120]   Against you, you only, I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight,
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:38.120]   so that you are justified when you speak and blameless when you judge."
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:46.120]   This Psalm of David reminds us that our sin is always before us, before God,
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.120]   and it's very humbling.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:53.120]   It should break our hearts.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:56.120]   It should cause a huge burden on us.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:02.120]   But the amazing thing is as children of God, we have the privilege
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:06.120]   to come before him and surrender it to him.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:14.120]   So if you guys have any sins, hidden sins that you've been just holding back,
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:18.120]   been living with each and every day, surrender them to God
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:22.120]   as you guys sing these next songs.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:26.120]   Ask God for forgiveness. Ask him to heal you.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:30.120]   Ask him to bring life to you.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:35.120]   And it's a reminder to us that it is not loneliness.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:37.120]   It is not our circumstances.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:43.120]   It is not our jobs, situations that cause us to be distant from God.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.120]   It is our sin.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:52.120]   So as James says, "Submit to God. Draw near to him, and he will draw near to you.
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.120]   Cleanse your hands. Purify your hearts.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:00.120]   Humble yourselves in the presence of God, and he will exalt you."
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:04.120]   So take these next--as we sing these next songs,
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:08.120]   just repent and surrender those sins.

[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:50.120]   We'll be moving on to the fourth topic.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.120]   The fourth topic is thankfulness and hope.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:01.120]   1 Thessalonians 5.18 says, "Give thanks in all circumstances,
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.120]   for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you."
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:09.120]   You know, a lot of times, it's really easy for us to be
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:12.120]   discontent with the situations we might be in,
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:16.120]   the relationships we might have, coworkers, schoolwork,
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.120]   work, whatever it is.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.120]   But I remember something that Pastor Peter shared a couple
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:29.120]   weeks ago was to really reflect on how the gospel impacted you.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:32.120]   And when we first remember the gospel,
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.120]   we remember God's grace.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.120]   We remember the fact that we were dead,
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:39.120]   the fact that we had nothing to begin with.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:43.120]   So the fact that we even have an opportunity to believe
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:49.120]   and call on, you know, our Abba Father is God's grace to us.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.120]   We shouldn't rather look at what we don't have,
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.120]   but really look at the things that God has really blessed us with.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:58.120]   So as we sing these next couple of songs,
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.120]   let's just really reflect on that truth,
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:05.120]   the fact that, you know, God has given us so much already,
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:08.120]   and we should have a heart of thankfulness to him
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.120]   in all circumstances.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.120]   We should have a heart of thankfulness to God
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:14.120]   and a heart of gratefulness to him in all circumstances,
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.120]   regardless of whatever we're going through.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.120]   So let's reflect on that truth.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:21.120]   Why don't we all stand for these next couple of songs?
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:38.120]   [music]
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:44.120]   The mystery of the cross I cannot comprehend
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:51.120]   The agonies of Calvary
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:58.120]   You, the perfect Holy One, crushed your son
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:04.120]   And drank the bitter cup reserved for me
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:11.120]   Your blood has washed away my sin, Jesus, thank you
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   The Father's wrath completely satisfied, Jesus, thank you
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:30.120]   Once your enemy, now seated at your table, Jesus, thank you
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:42.120]   [music]
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:48.120]   By your perfect sacrifice I've been brought new
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:55.120]   Your enemy, you've made your friend
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:02.120]   Pouring out the riches of your glorious grace
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:08.120]   Your mercy and your kindness now know when
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:15.120]   Your blood has washed away my sin, Jesus, thank you
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:22.120]   The Father's wrath completely satisfied, Jesus, thank you
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:34.120]   Once your enemy, now seated at your table, Jesus, thank you
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:42.120]   [music]
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.120]   So lover of my soul
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:58.120]   I want to live for you
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:04.120]   Lover of my soul
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:11.120]   I want to live for you
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:17.120]   Lover of my soul
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:25.120]   I want to live for you
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:31.120]   Lover of my soul
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:39.120]   I want to live for you
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:46.120]   Your blood has washed away my sin, Jesus, thank you
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:53.120]   The Father's wrath completely satisfied, Jesus, thank you
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:10:06.120]   Once your enemy, now seated at your table, Jesus, thank you
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:19.120]   [music]
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:37.120]   [piano]
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:43.120]   How great the chasm that lay between us
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:50.120]   How high the mountain I could not climb
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:57.120]   In desperation I turned to heaven
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:03.120]   And spoke your name into the night
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:10.120]   Then through the darkness your loving kindness
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:17.120]   Tore through the shadows of my soul
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:24.120]   The work is finished, the end is written
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:30.120]   Jesus Christ, I live thee alone
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:34.120]   [piano]
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:40.120]   Who could imagine so great a mercy
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:46.120]   What heart could fathom such boundless grace
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:53.120]   The God of ages stepped down from glory
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:12:00.120]   To bear my sin and end my shame
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:06.120]   The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:13.120]   The King of kings calls me his own
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:20.120]   A beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:27.120]   Jesus Christ, my living hope
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:34.120]   Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:40.120]   Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:47.120]   You have broken every chain, there's salvation in your name
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:53.120]   Jesus Christ, my living hope
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:13:00.120]   Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:07.120]   Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:14.120]   You have broken every chain, there's salvation in your name
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:21.120]   Jesus Christ, my living hope
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.120]   [piano]
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:30.120]   Then came the morning that sealed the promise
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:37.120]   Your buried body began to breathe
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:43.120]   Out of the silence, the roaring lion
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:50.120]   Declared the grave has no claim on me
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:57.120]   Then came the morning that sealed the promise
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:03.120]   Your buried body began to breathe
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:10.120]   Out of the silence, the roaring lion
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:17.120]   Declared the grave has no claim on me
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:24.120]   Jesus Christ is the victory
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:34.120]   Oh, hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:40.120]   Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:47.120]   You have broken every chain, there's salvation in your name
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:54.120]   Jesus Christ, my living hope
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:15:00.120]   Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:07.120]   Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:14.120]   You have broken every chain, there's salvation in your name
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:20.120]   Jesus Christ, my living hope
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:27.120]   Jesus Christ, my living hope
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:34.120]   Jesus Christ, my living hope
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:37.120]   [piano]
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:48.120]   You guys just remain standing because we're going to start moving into our final topic.
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:56.120]   And what I'd like to highlight is the topic of expressing your love to God and saying to our Lord and Father,
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:03.120]   our Savior, our Master, everything to us, that God I love you. Right?
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:11.120]   Now, one, for a lot of us, or some of us, those words I love you, we, you know,
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:16.120]   we deserve for those special relationships, and we should, you know.
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:21.120]   We shouldn't just be throwing around like, I love this, I love that, I love this, because perhaps then
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:28.120]   we make cheap of the affection that we give, right? But nevertheless, with our God,
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:35.120]   we start the night thinking about what's pleasing to Him. And you think from His perspective.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:41.120]   The way to deeply please the Lord is to receive the love and affection that we have,
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:46.120]   to express it verbally, to express it in every way possible.
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:54.120]   And so, as we think about this last topic, think about how many times in Scripture God has said,
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:17:01.120]   as a matter of fact, I mean, you think about what Christ asked of His disciples, "Do you love me?"
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:07.120]   He asked Peter, "Do you love me more than these?" God summarized the entire law that we ought to love God
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:14.120]   with all our heart, mind, and soul, and strength. You think about what is the will of God for us.
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:21.120]   Yes, we want to be diligent. Yes, we want to put forth all that we can in everything we do.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:27.120]   But if there is an endeavor that is genuinely pleasing to God, we know that He would love to hear our voice
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:31.120]   proclaiming our love for Him. Amen? So as we wrap up with this last song,
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:36.120]   again, continue to just pour out your heart to the Lord. Let's sing.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:48.120]   [Music]
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:18:06.120]   I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice to worship you.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:28.120]   Oh, my soul, rejoice, take joy, my King, in what you hear.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:41.120]   Let it be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear.
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.120]   Sing, "I love you, Lord."
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:19:01.120]   I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice to worship you.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:24.120]   Oh, my soul, rejoice, take joy, my King, in what you hear.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:50.120]   Let it be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear.
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:56.120]   [Music]
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:00.120]   Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer as we end the evening.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:05.120]   God, we are, again, so thankful that we're able to gather.
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:09.120]   Lord, that we're able to lift up to you our voices.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:14.120]   And God, to say to you, Lord, you are exalted on high.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:20.120]   God, although we be so weak and sinful, your grace is so sufficient for us.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:23.120]   And God, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:27.120]   And what's more, God, we recognize the most cursed state,
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:34.120]   the worst of all scenarios, would be to be far from you, God, to not know your love.
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:40.120]   And what's more, the most dangerous situation for us would be when our hearts are cold for you.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:45.120]   And so I pray, Father God, that you would challenge us, you would teach us,
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:50.120]   you would stir us through your Spirit, so that, God, our love for you would be lively.
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:55.120]   God, we praise you and lift you up. We thank you again. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:01.120]   All right, everybody. The sanctuary is going to be open for you guys to hang out and just fellowship and talk.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.120]   But that concludes our worship service. Thanks.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:09.120]   [Music]
