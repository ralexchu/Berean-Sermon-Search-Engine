[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [no audio]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   underlying point.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Okay, primarily judgment, right? Restoration as well,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   but primarily judgment. So chapter 1 through 39 is
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   primarily about why judgment is coming upon Israel, why judgment is coming upon
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   the nations, right? For those who basically attacked Israel.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   And then we said, so chapter 1 through 39 is about why judgment
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   is coming. Chapter 40 to 66, primarily
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   what do we say?
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Restoration, right?
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   So chapter, again, we're not saying that every single chapter, every verse is that way,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   but generally speaking 1 through 39 establishes why judgment
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   is coming. And then chapter 40
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   to 66 establishes why the need for the Messiah, why is the
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Messiah coming, right? So if we were to kind of put it in another way,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   basically chapter 1 through 39 is the Old Testament, and
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   chapter 40 through 66 is the New Testament, if you want to see it in
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   a kind of broad picture. So if you skim
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   through the 39 chapters, then by the time we come to the Messiah we're going to
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   say, "Oh, it's great the Messiah came." But if you kind of wrestle through
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   what He was saying, and wrestle through why judgment is coming, there's a reason why God
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   spends so much time detailing why the sin,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   why the judgment, how the judgment is coming, what the sin looks like, what God thinks about
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   the sin, right? So that by the time we come and He begins to introduce the Messiah,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   that there is a clear answer to all of this
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   problem, right? So if you don't know the problem well, you're not going to know the
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   answer well either, right? If you skim through the sin, you're
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   not going to, by the time you come to salvation, it's going to be like, "Oh yeah, He just saved us.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   We were bad, He saved us because we were bad." Right?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   There's a reason why God spends two-thirds of the Old Testament
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   talking about and studying through the judgment that's coming upon
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   the world, right? The curses. So again,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I know some of you guys are having a hard time going through Isaiah, you're kind of like,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   "Oh, I don't get it. It's kind of all over the place." I told you from the beginning that Isaiah is like
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   that. It's not organized thematically, like chapter 1, 2,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   3 is this and 4, 5, 6 is like that. He jumps around. Even historically,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   sometimes He'll talk about something. Remember Isaiah chapter 6 is
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   about the calling of Isaiah? You know, you would think that would
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   begin at the beginning of the book, but it actually happens in chapter 6. The whole book
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   is like that. He'll just kind of interject thematically where He feels like it's the best place
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   to come in. So if you feel like, "You know, I don't get the flow of
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Isaiah." Don't worry about it, okay? Just know the chapters that we're
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   studying, what is the theme of that, okay? And then hopefully
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   later on, next time you read it, you'll see a little bit better connection.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   But from the beginning, if you try to swallow or digest too much, you're going to end up not
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   catching even the smaller stuff, okay? So if you're wrestling with that, don't feel
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   too bad. Just kind of pay attention to what's in front of you. And another thing I want to remind
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   you is that Isaiah is not one of those studies that if you come in
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   not prepared, right? If you come in not prepared, just kind of
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   you skim through it and you don't really know what's going on in the chapters that we're studying,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   it's going to be very difficult for you to catch because I'm not there going to say, "Look at
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   verse 3 and what does that word mean and how it relates to this verse?" Because we're going over
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   two, sometimes four chapters at a time. And in the 30, 40
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   minutes that we have, there is no way that we're going to be able to do it expositionally like that.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So I have to just assume that the questions that I ask you, you're wrestling, at least
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   you know when I mention it that you know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   So again, just as a reminder, there's a reason why the Bible studies
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   have been divided that way so that you guys can take plenty
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   of time to wrestle with it so that we can unpack what you wrestled with. But if you didn't
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   wrestle with it before you came, when we unpack it, it's going to be a lot harder for you to
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   grasp. Okay? Just as a reminder. Now having said that,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   chapter 40 and on is a little bit easier. It's easier
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   because it is, one, the theme is about restoration
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   and secondly, there is a little bit more connection
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   in 40 and on than there is the first 39 chapters. And we'll see that
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   when we go. Okay? Alright, so let's jump into
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   chapter 34 and 35. Chapter 34 and 35
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   is connected to the previous chapters where it's talking about the judgment.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Chapter 34, right, who's
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   God's judgment directed toward in verses 1 through 7?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Even though it is, if you look into
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   details, it's probably related to the Assyrians. But again,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   it's not just to them. If you look at the language, it's very public.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   He says, "Draw near, O nations, O hear, and give attention, O peoples."
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   In other words, he's about to bring judgment, but this is
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   not done privately. And it is not done in secret. He's telling
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   the whole nations, what I'm about to do, I'm doing it very publicly.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I want you to see this is what's going to happen, and I want you to know why it's happening.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Okay?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   His judgment that he's talking about here, obviously
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   every judgment of God is harsh, but the judgment that he brings in chapter 34,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   he describes himself as someone who is
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   enraged. R.C. Sproul,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I think it's in his book, Holiness of God.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   He describes the wrath of God in the Greek, the word is
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   "orgay." And the word "orgay" is the word where we
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   get the New Testament word, or the English word, "orgy."
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And the word "orgy" basically means an unbridled, unadulterated
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   just lust.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Right? Emotion, and there is no filter, it's just kind of
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   letting your flesh just have it. And R.C. Sproul describes that word
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   "orgay," and that's the word that's described to describe
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   the wrath of God is being revealed in the New Testament. And so when God talks
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   about the wrath of God, just like he gives love,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   and he gives love to the fullest, his love is beyond what you and I will ever comprehend.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Right? To give his only begotten son. Well his wrath
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   is just as intense. Right? His wrath is unlike any
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   other kind of wrath that we've ever seen. And so that's why
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   again, we say it over and over again when we talk about the cross, the cross is a perfect
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   union of the intense wrath of God being satisfied
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   by the intense love of God. But if you take
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   either side, you don't have the cross. If you minimize
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   the wrath of God, it's like did the Son of God really have to be
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   put on the cross? Right? Because if you don't understand the wrath of
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   God, you won't understand why only Christ could satisfy
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   the wrath of God. So one of the questions again I asked about that is when we
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   study about the wrath of God, we have a tendency to kind of
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   skim over the wrath and get to the cross, and get to His grace. But again
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   if you skim over His wrath and you don't fully understand that God is a
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   jealous God, and then we come through certain parts of the Bible
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   in the Old Testament where it is hard for us to understand. We go up to the New Testament
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   where He wipes out a third of the earth, a judgment of hell fire
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   that is going to be forever. And it's just kind of hard to understand because the
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   picture that we've created about God doesn't fit hell.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   But the picture that we've created about God doesn't fit hell because that's the
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   God that we've created in our culture. The God of the Bible fits the Bible
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   because it's in the Bible. Or fits hell because it's in the Bible. Right?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So we have to ask ourselves, like the things that disturb us, things that
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   don't make sense to us, is that because the Bible
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   is causing us to create this conflict? Or is it because the
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   God that I've imaged, the image I have in my head doesn't fit
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   what I'm reading? Right? And if we're not careful we'll read
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   through it and just kind of, "Oh it doesn't make sense. I don't understand it." So we just kind of skim over it.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Right? Never really diving into it. Never wrestling with it. You just kind of like,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   "Well this is who He is and we're satisfied with that." Right? And I think that's dangerous
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   because there is so much emphasis about the wrath of God,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   about His jealousy, about His holiness, that if we just skim over it and
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   just have a vague understanding of that, you're not going to have
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   a clear picture of the cross either. Like why
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   was Jesus the only one? Why was the Son of God the only one who was able
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   to satisfy the wrath of God? Right? Again,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   He's described here as someone who was enraged. His wrath has been filled to the brim.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Right? So He's not simply talking about, "Hey you committed this
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   particular sin and I'm going to punish you for this." He's talking about all
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   the wrath combined. It's just kind of gotten to the point where He's no longer holding
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   back. He's going to just release His anger
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   upon the nations. Right? So if you look at the
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   description of all of this, He's not—it's beyond
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   just like a momentary judgment. Right?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   In verse 6 and 7,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   what does it mean? The Lord has a sword. It is stated in blood. It is
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   gorged with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the donkeys or kidneys of
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   rams. What is this imagery about this animals and sacrifices
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   and what does that have to do with the wrath of God?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Anybody?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Any kind of—like wrestled with that? He's talking about judgment
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   that's coming. So what is verse 6 and 7?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   How is that related to His wrath?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   [inaudible]
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   [inaudible]
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   [inaudible]
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   [inaudible]
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   [inaudible]
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   If you look at verse 6 and 7, this is not just talking about any animals. He's talking about
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   sacrifices. Right? He said all these sacrifices are being made because
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   why are they being made? Why were they necessary? Because of sin.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   So He's saying the wrath of God is coming just like there
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   was a need for the wrath of God to be appeased by the slaughter of these
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   animals. Now God's judgment is coming because of this sin. Right?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   So as animals were sacrifices that needed to be
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   given because of the sins of God's people, judgment is coming as a result of sins of the
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   nations. Right? So if you look at this,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   basically—He may not be saying this, but basically the only
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   way that you can appease the wrath of God is by the blood sacrifice
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   or by receiving the wrath of God. Right?
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   He said the nation of Israel was given
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   opportunity by faith when they sacrificed these things where the
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   wrath of God is being appeased, ultimately obviously by the blood of Christ. Right?
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   But He says that wrath, that whatever is not
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   placed on Christ is going to come upon the nations.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Right?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Again, I mentioned
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   this again, and you guys can talk about this later, but this question
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   basically is where all throughout Isaiah up to this point,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   where Isaiah has been vacillating between God's judgment, His restoration,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   judgment and restoration. Right? And in fact, you can probably summarize the whole Bible
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   as these two themes. Judgment coming because of sin,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   but God having mercy for these sinners. But His mercy isn't just,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   "You know what? I'm just going to forgive all of you." It's those who come to repent.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Those who receive the cleansing blood of Christ. Right? And He vacillates
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   back and forth. And as I mentioned before, if you minimize the wrath
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   of God, you will minimize the grace of God. Right?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   If you don't talk about hell, heaven isn't going to be
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   as accurate. Right? Because it's in contrast.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Right? His love and His anger. His grace.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Right? And His judgment. They have to be understood
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   side by side. Right?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   You can't say, "Oh, that building is really tall." But it's really tall
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   in comparison to what? To the other buildings. Right?
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   You put that in Grand Canyon, it doesn't look that big. Right? But in comparison to other buildings
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   it's big. So His grace is always coupled in comparison
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   with His wrath, and vice versa. Right? Because that's how the Bible
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   revealed it.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Who or what is God's judgment directed towards?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   He says, "All those who went against Zion." So Zion, obviously,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   the immediate context is talking about Israel. But in the larger context
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   when we talk about the judgment of God, including the Gentiles, it's His church. It's His kingdom.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Right? So again, this wrath is not
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   simply against one nation. Even though Assyria is
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   in the picture, again, we said that the larger application is
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   to the whole world. So it seems like the
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   greater application is the end times.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And Edom, in verse 9, is the focus of the judgment. Right?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Edom is a sister nation to Israel,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   but it has hated Israel more than any other nation.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   In fact, I think it's probably true that
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   the worst enemies were at one point good friends.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Right? And something went wrong. You don't have enemies that are
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   far away. Right? Typically. Because they don't know you. There's not
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   enough interaction to hate each other. Usually enemies are people who are close by. And so
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   the Edomites were kind of like sister nation to Israel. And they
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   were the constant antagonists to the nation of Israel.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   So oftentimes Edom is mentioned to represent all the nations
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   that went against Israel. Okay?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   What is
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   the duration of the judgment and what is its significance?
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   The punishment is severe. It is nonstop. It is
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   night and day. Again, this is not just a slap on the
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   hand. And it sounds a lot like the white throne judgment
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   of Revelations. Once the judgment happens, that is
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   the final judgment. It is not a momentary judgment and
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   then restoration. This judgment that he's talking about is everlasting.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   It is permanent and it's forever.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   [pause]
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Verse 13
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   and 17. What does the gathering of different animals
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   by the Spirit have to do with God's judgment? Again, as it
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   states in verse 11, a plumb line is a way to measure for accuracy. This description of the
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   animals is a measurement of emptiness. So let's
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   look at verse 11. It says, "But the hawk and the porcupine
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   shall possess it, the owl and the raven shall dwell in it. He shall stretch the line of
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   the confusion over it, and the plumb line of emptiness."
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   In other words, he's describing, like the judgment is so thorough that these
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   animals can just kind of roam free. Because there's no human.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Right?
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   So Israel, again, is described as a
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   field that's not cultivated where there's wild animals and they're just roaming
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   around but there's no human to cultivate it.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Immediately I think about the Garden of Eden after Adam and Eve is
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   forsaken. Adam and Eve was created
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   to be caretakers of the land and because of the sin
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   they're cast out and is no longer taken care of. And that's the kind of picture that I see where
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   God's creation is intact but the caretakers are not there. Because of
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   judgment. So again, over and over
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   again, chapter 34 is talking about the severity
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   and the intensity of God's wrath and His anger.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And He's making sure that He's not just angry. He's
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   burning in anger. He's enraged. Right?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   He's not simply looking at the world and, you know, again, oftentimes we see
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   a picture of God only, and I'm not saying this is not accurate or it's not true,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   we only see a picture of God as the prodigal son's father.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Right? Who's just waiting, waiting for sinners to come,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   waiting for sinners to come. But the Bible also describes a God who is
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   enraged in anger. Right? Again, this is not just me.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Read the scripture. The scripture describes God who is
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   holding back His wrath but when the time of grace is
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   finished and He allows Himself and He says, "Okay, there's nothing holding Him
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   back anymore." He said, "The wrath of God is going to be revealed." Like ultimately
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   with nothing holding Him back. Right? And so at the very end
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   when He comes, He's not only coming to save and redeem
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   mankind, He's coming where as the cross absorbed
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   the sin of mankind, that wrath, that whatever was not placed on Jesus is going
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   to be upon mankind. Right? And that's also a
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   picture of the Bible. It's not just a picture of the
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   father, prodigal son, just waiting, waiting, waiting. He's also
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   that same God who wiped out the earth. Right?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And only eight people remained. Right? He said, "That's that
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   same God. The same God who came and just wiped out Jericho."
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Right? These people are under ban because they're all going to be under judgment.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   The same God who created hell. He created
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   hell. And that God is the God who is
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   coming. Right? And again, I think that's why if you've never read
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   the book "Holiness of God" I strongly encourage you to read it because when we have
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   a skewed perspective or imperfect perspective
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   of who He is, right, because our generation
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   or I don't know, then even His grace isn't
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   going to seem amazing. It's just going to be grace.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Right? I think it's extremely important for us that we have an accurate picture
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   of how the Bible describes God. And chapter 34
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   makes sure that we get that. We get that. Okay?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Okay.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   We're not going to go through this right now for the sake of time because I want to get through all of it.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Chapter 34 is about the wrath. Chapter 35
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   is about restoration. So those of you guys, hopefully you read through,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   you know that chapter 36 through 39 is about history, specific
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   history. Right? So chapter 1 through 35 is
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   about judgment and then again, vacillates back
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   and forth to restoration. So He ends with promise of restoration.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Right? What is the promise, what is
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   promised from the coming of the Lord? First it says vengeance.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   So the first thing that we think of
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   is wrath.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   I think every Christian, there should be a tension. There should be
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   a tension when we think about His second coming. Because as much
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   as second coming means our life and it is our glory,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   it means judgment for mankind. Right? It means judgment
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   for people that we may care about, our co-workers. It means judgment to
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   everyone who does not confess Christ. Right? So I think
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   every Christian, in one sense, we ought to be longing for Him and that should
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   affect the way that we live. But there also ought to be a sense
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   of dread. Because when He comes,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   He says He's going to come in His full vengeance. Right?
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   I think there's a reason why when Paul was going out and he's saying
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   he prays that the gospel may spread rapidly.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   You know, he knows the sovereignty of God. He knows that God is completely
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   in control. But at the same time, he knows the consequence
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   of not knowing Christ. Right? He knows the consequence of when He does
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   come. So humanly speaking, there's a sense of urgency. He wasn't just living
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   casually. He lived so that the gospel may spread to the remotest
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   part of the world as fast as it can. It's not like, "Oh, God is sovereign, so therefore
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   let's not worry about tomorrow." Right? He's the one who teaches about the sovereignty
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   of God and yet He lives every single day. Right? With that sense of urgency.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And I think this has something to do with it. Right? Knowing that His coming
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   isn't just Santa Claus coming to pass out candy. He's going to come in
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   His full glory. And His full glory always means grace and judgment at the same
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   time. Right? If He doesn't come in His judgment, that's
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   not His full glory. His full glory means every part of who He is is going to be glorified.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Right? His grace and His wrath.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   He will also come to save.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Right? Open the eyes of the blind and the ears of the deaf.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Lame shall walk and leap like a deer.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Tongue of the mute shall sing
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   for joy. So if you notice all of this, that it's not just they see.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Right? It's not just that they hear. It's that lame aren't just going to walk.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   They're going to leap for joy like a deer. Right? People who couldn't talk and all of a
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   sudden, you know, they're talking. He said, "No, they're going to be singing for joy."
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   So just as vengeance is intense, His wrath is intense,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   so is His restoration. Right?
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   So when we say that God is a jealous God, that every part of Him is intense,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   right? Just as salvation is intense, so is judgment.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   What do you think the highway called the way of holiness is in reference to?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Okay.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   I want you to think about what highway, like when you think of highway,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   what do you immediately think of?
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   I mean, the only reference we have is highway.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Right? If you thought of something else, I don't know where
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   you're from, but the only highway that I know of is
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   five, the freeway. I was thinking about other numbers.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   I can't think of anything. Just five. Right?
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   We think about that, but think about at that time when they said
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   highway, what they would have meant, because obviously they didn't have cars. Right?
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   They didn't have nice roads. In fact, nice roads didn't come
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   until when? Huh?
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Yeah, until the time of Rome. Right? There weren't nice roads.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   It was basically somebody would travel down this mountain, and if enough people
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   took that road, the grass started to die, and then the roads started flattening out,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   and that became the best road. So even the best of roads
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   weren't that good. Right? It wasn't the Romans until they came,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   and their empire was so huge, and they wanted to
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   make sure that their soldiers were able to get to wherever they needed to get to as quickly as they could.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   And that was one of the keys to their success. They made roads
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   for military purposes. And all of a sudden, it became, like
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   once the roads got connected, people were able to exchange commerce and go back
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   and forth because of these roads. None of that happened until the Romans came in.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Until then, even if you wanted to, let's say if you lived here, and you wanted to go over
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   there, you had to take all of your supplies and go over this mountain,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   go over the terrain, through the woods, rivers, whatever, to get to the other side.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Right? So when the Bible talks about how God's going to bring, and He's going to bring
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   a holy highway. Right? So think about it from their
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   point of view. The word highway literally means road lifted.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Right? Because literally that's what that means. Right? So if a Jew
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   was reading this in his language, highway, he would have immediately pictured
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   a road that's lifted up. Right? And so that's the picture
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   that's given. It's like when Christ comes, that this road, and what does this
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   road lead to?
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   To God. Right? This pathway that
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   was difficult to get through, maybe impossible,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   maybe there was a mountain between you, maybe there was a deep valley that you couldn't pass.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And when He comes, the path to His glory is going to be paved. It's going
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   to be high. It's going to be the best road. Remember we talked about that,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   the cities of refuge? That these particular cities were spread out,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   that no matter where you were in Israel, that you had a clear sight of
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   one of these cities, and that every road was the best
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   roads in Israel were always the ones that led to the cities of refuge.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Right? And who were the people that these
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   cities of refuge were made for?
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Accidental killing.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   So think about how often do you think that happened, that six
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   different cities were built on top of a hill, and best roads.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   He said to carve down hills,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   and fill in the valleys, and make the best roads. So how often do you think this
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   happened that God would say, that make these cities, dedicate all your
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   time, money, and energy to build these cities. I'm thinking this
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   road probably was not taken that often. Right?
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   I don't think that was a happen, like every two days, like where's he running? Oh he just killed somebody.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   You know, I don't think that was a common occurrence. Right?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Because I think that that was built for the purpose of, again, as a
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   shadow to teach us that the refuge, at the end of it,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   the high priest, who we know as to be Christ,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   that he's the protector once you get to that city. I think all of that
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   drama, and all of that money spent on the road was for the purpose of teaching us in the New Testament
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   that the best roads, right, the best roads that
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   he prepared for us to get to our refuge, Christ,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   was built. And that was the city of refuge was a shadow of that. Right?
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   And I think it was for that purpose.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   You know, I think the pragmatist would have seen that and said, like, really? Dedicate all our
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   money for that? You know what I mean? There's poor people that can't go from one village
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   to the other and you're going to make us build this on top of the hill? Right?
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   But again, all of that was to prepare to teach us about who Christ is.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   So when the Bible talks about that, again,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   today we think about roads and, you know,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   think about, like, oh it would have been great if we invented
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   the car, you know, 200 years ago. 200 years ago your car would have been absolutely useless.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Think about how many things needed to be invented
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   before a car was able to be used. If you don't have roads,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   the car's useless. Right? Oh, you can go
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   80 miles per hour. Where? Right?
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   At Grand Canyon? Like, where are you going to go 80 miles per hour, 100 miles per hour?
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   If you don't have the roads, it's absolutely useless. Right? So all these
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   things have to happen. So today we think about roads and we take that for granted, but without
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   these roads, we can't go to where we want to go.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Right? And again, it literally means
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   raised roads. So all that stuff that would get in the way of
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   your carriage or, you know, you walking, said it would be raised so you would go
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   right above all of that. Right?
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Now was there a road that was like this? The only roads that we know of
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   in Israel before the time of Christ was these roads, cities of refuge.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Right? The only roads that were dedicated
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   for that purpose, to go somewhere that far, would have been these. Right?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   So again, you know, we're not going to take some time to study, but I really encourage
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   you, if you have time, to study the cities of refuge and what he teaches
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   on that, because it's meant to
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   highlight who Jesus is and what he means to us in the New Testament.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Okay? And I know, I don't know who was here
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   when we, we went through that years and years ago. I'm assuming if you were here
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   you forgot, and most of you probably don't remember. Right?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Or you weren't here. Okay?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   What causes the sorrow and sighing to flee to be replaced by singing and rejoicing?
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Right? Presence of the Lord, when he comes in his full glory.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Right?
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   This is not what he brings, it's not that he's going to make things right,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   it's just his presence. When he comes,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   this is going to happen.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   It is no different today. I think about all the problems
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   and all the things that we pray for, all the things that we long for, in the end, if you have
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   deep fellowship with Christ, for whatever the reason, it makes it right.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Right? All of a sudden you can bear it.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Like all the loneliness, all the pain, all the frustration, but for whatever
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   the reason, when you're near Christ, all of a sudden you can endure it.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   That things make sense. Right? And I'm sure you can
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   testify that too. Like, you know, when I met Christ, all the anger
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   and bitterness, hatred, just overnight, it made sense.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   It didn't fix all my problems, but it made sense. Right? Because I
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   knew that God was in control. Right? So, again, it's
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   described when he comes, simply by his presence.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Right? Simply by his presence. All the
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   ramification of sins, all the curse is going to be reversed, simply by his presence.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   So the whole point of salvation is to open the door to get to him.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Right? So, again, when we come to the New Testament,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   if we celebrate the open door, and you don't
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   fellowship with him, because the gift of salvation is Christ,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   and if we proclaim that it's Christ, and we sing that it's
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Christ, but we don't come to him, you miss the whole gift of salvation.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Right? Because the point of salvation is Christ.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   It's to love Christ, to fellowship with Christ. If his presence
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   is what fixes the problem of sin, right?
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   You miss the whole point of salvation just to say, "Look at that wide open
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   door. Look at what Jesus did." And you celebrate the Gospel because you're celebrating
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   what happened. Right?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   It's just like going to Grand Canyon and celebrating the picture.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   You know what I mean? Instead of enjoying Grand Canyon, you're just looking at
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   the pictures. "Look how awesome this picture is." But the whole point of it is
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   you're there. Right? So if we
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   do not take advantage of the fact that the door has been opened, we can
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   commune with him, we can talk to him, we can pray to him, then you
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   miss the whole point of salvation. The whole point of salvation is not simply going to heaven.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Right? The gift of salvation, of heaven, is because heaven
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   is the unadulterated presence of God is in heaven.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   So we get a taste of that here, we get the full
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   meal when we get to heaven. Right? But it has to start here.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   If we really knew what it was. Right?
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Alright, so chapter 36 to 39, I'm just going to go over
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   it real quick. I'm not going to go into too much detail. Because it's strict
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   history. 36, 37, 38 is
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   against Israel's threat. Assyrian threat. So obviously, hopefully you had some time to
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   read it. Historical background. It's almost identical. It's placed in
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   three separate places. In King's Chronicles and here.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Chapter 39 is in reference to
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   because remember what Hezekiah does? Right? Hezekiah kind of
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   gets excited because he's delivered from Assyrians. And then he thinks like, oh it's
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   safe. And then he lets them in. Not realizing that once
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   they get a taste of, oh this is what Israel has. Eventually they are going to come and covet that.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   And then come and take it. Right? So the prophecy is about the judgment coming.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Right? Now you're delivered from Assyrians, but now you're going to be judged by the
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Babylonians. So that's how those four chapters break out. Right?
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   So up to this point, up to
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   chapter 37, 38, the Assyrian invasion
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   was a broad background behind everything that we've been talking about.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Right?
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   So now Isaiah gives a historical record
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   of what happened during the time he prophesied. So again, you don't need to know
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   all the details, but just kind of as a broad reference, historical background.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   This is what's going on. So what you read in chapter 36, 37, 38,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   and 39 is kind of the historical background of what
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   we were talking about in the last chapter 1 through 38.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Okay?
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   So the
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   theme right here is the name of the guy that comes.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   His name is
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Rabshakeh. That is not
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   his actual name, but a title. He's a high official or
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   commander in the Assyrian army. So it's a title. It's not a name.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   So a commander of the Assyrian army is coming, basically mocking Israel,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   saying, "Why do you think? We've conquered everybody else. Why do you
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   think that you're going to be safe from us?" And the whole dialogue between him is to
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   put fear into Assyria, saying, "Don't trust Hezekiah."
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   And so again, the theme of this section is, "What is the confidence
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   in which you trust?" And so Isaiah is using what he's
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   saying kind of as a springboard to describe,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   "We'll tell you what we trust." And that's a revelation in these
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   historical passages, is Isaiah revealing that this is what
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Israel trusts or should trust.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   So one of the great battles for Hezekiah during his time was the temptation to make
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   defensive alliance with Egypt. So he saw the Assyrians
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   coming. He saw what he did to his neighbors, to Syria and to
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   the northern kingdom. So the only other superpower at that time,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   because Babylonians were not a superpower yet, until they conquered
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   the Assyrians, right? So the only other superpower at that time were the Egyptians.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Now Egyptians were not as powerful as the Assyrians, but if they were
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   going to ally with anybody to get help, Egyptians would be the only ones.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   So that's why, remember, Isaiah keeps saying over and over again, "Why are you trusting
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   in man?" Right? "Why are you trusting in chariots?" Because they kept
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   on making allegiance with other nations to protect themselves
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   from a greater enemy. And so that's kind of like the historical context.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   And so that's why he's saying, he says, "Oh, these Egyptians, they're
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   dogs. We can rip them apart, they're nothing." Is that where your confidence is?
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Right? So
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Isaiah is discouraging Hezekiah to not put trust
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   in man. And we see that over and over again in all of his writings up to this point.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Right? That theme over and over again. Why do you go to these
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   other human beings? All they are is just other human beings.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   They're just idols. Why would you put confidence in them?
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   So the whole point of Isaiah's writing is, "Don't put your trust in them, put your
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   trust in God."
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   But if you say to me, "We trust in the Lord our God."
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Meaning like, "Okay, so are you putting trust in Egypt?" Right?
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   "We conquered everybody else. Why do you think they're going to help you?" Well, maybe
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   you're trusting in your God. Right? So basically he's mocking them.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Right?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Wasn't Hezekiah the one who took away your high places?
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   So what were the high places?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   (Audience) Worship of other gods.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Worship of foreign gods. And sometimes they worship Yahweh there.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   God strictly prohibited them to worship in high places.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Remember when the kingdom splits? Right? The sin of Jeroboam
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   and sin of Rehoboam. And these are the two sins that kind of followed
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   these two kingdoms. So what was the sin of Jeroboam?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   The northern kingdom.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Yes. Well what did they worship?
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Calf worship. Right? He created a calf
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   worship. He set up a temple in Dan and then said, "This is your
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   God. This is Yahweh." Right? And so that was the sin of Jeroboam. And that led to
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   idolatry. Sin of Rehoboam was the sin
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   of worshiping in high places. So they were still worshiping God, but it wasn't
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   prescribed the way that God wanted them to. Right? So
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   typically the high places were all the idol worships took place. So Israel basically
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   took the worship of Yahweh and said, "We're going to worship here." Just like the
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   pagans do. So they were following, they were worshiping Yahweh, but they were worshiping
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   in the model of the pagans. And so God
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   always detested that. And remember even the good kings, He says,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   "They did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, except they did not put away the high places."
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Right? Hezekiah, when his
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   revival came under his leadership, it was thorough. He got rid of that
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   too. Right? So he's saying,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   so the commander is saying, the Assyrian commander is saying, "Well if you worship
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   God, right, and you put your trust in Him, wasn't Hezekiah
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   the one who prohibited you from worshiping Him in the high places?" In other
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   words, he's mocking him. He's like, "He won't even let you worship God." Even though that was
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   for the purpose of rightly worshiping God. Right? So in other words, he's kind of
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   poking holes. Almost like Satan talking to Eve. Did God really say that?
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   You know? God doesn't want you to be wise like Him.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And so he's kind of like Satan putting his, "Oh, isn't He the
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   one who prevented you from getting to your God? Why would you put your confidence in Hezekiah
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   if He won't even allow you to get to Him?" Right?
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   So again, he's
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   mocking what Hezekiah did and hoping that he would put some fear into
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   them.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   [pause]
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   In fact,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   in the next passage, in verse 10, he actually says,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   "Well if you're going to worship Him, you know, and you have confidence in Him,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   your God is on my side, not on your side." Right? "He must be on my
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   side because look at all of this stuff. Look at our power. Look at all the other
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   nations that we conquered. So your God could not possibly be with you, but your God is
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   already with me." So he's basically just kind of, you know, this is a false prophet
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   just going and just planting seeds of doubt, of fear.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Right?
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   But how do they respond?
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   He said, "They held their
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   peace." Right? He says that they
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   don't say anything. You know, Hezekiah instructs the commanders on the wall,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   "Don't respond to him." Right? Basically he's a
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   mad dog barking. Right? If you engage him, you're going to get
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   bit. Right? "Don't engage him. Just stay silent." And so what does he do?
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   He goes into prayer, chapter 37.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Chapter 37 is him seeking the Lord.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Again, Hezekiah truly was a man of God.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   He was like any other man. You know, even though he
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   brought reform, he prayed to God. You know, when he was fearful, he
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   ran to Egypt. And Isaiah is saying, "No, don't go to Egypt." Right?
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   "God's going to deliver you." And so in trouble, he turns
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   to the Lord and he prays. And specifically God says, "Because you prayed,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   I will answer your prayer." Right?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   So think about that. You know, in God's sovereignty, I think partially
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   the reason why we don't pray, partially, is because we believe in a sovereign God.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Do I really need to pray? Right? He knows my
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   needs even before I say it. So do I really need to wrestle and struggle
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   since God already knows? Right? Again, in this case, I mean,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   God loves the nation of Israel. His whole point was to deliver. Right? And yet
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   He says, "Because you prayed, I will answer you." Right?
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   So it's God's, part of God's sovereign
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   predestined will that He will respond when we pray. Now how does that
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   work? I'll tell you after Bible study. Right? Because I figured it out.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   I don't know. But that's what the Bible says. Right?
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   I don't know how it works. I just know that
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   that's how it works. Right?
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   You know, I endure all things for the sake of the elect.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   If He elected them, why endure? But that's what He says.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   God has ordained our work, our preaching, our perseverance,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   our prayer to accomplish His purpose. And again, you see it working
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   out. Right? So again,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   God promises deliver because of His prayer. And then
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   chapter 38 and 39. Again, I'm not going to get
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   too deep into this. In fact, I'm not going to get into it at all.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   Right? Because it
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   requires a lot more discussion than what I'm going to be able to say.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   Hezekiah prays. And when does this happen? Hezekiah gets sick
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   and God says, "You're going to die." When does this happen?
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   During the siege. Right?
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   During the siege. God says, "He's going to die." So I'm thinking maybe Hezekiah
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   is thinking, "You can't kill me now. I'm the king and I have to
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   protect them. If I die now, who's going to lead them?" Maybe he's thinking about all of this.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   And he's pleading with God. Maybe it wasn't just that he was afraid to die.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Maybe he was just reading into it. Right? But this happened while he was
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   under siege and he prays to God to prolong his life. And God
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   delivers him. And how many years does he add to his life?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Fifteen years. Right? So we can get into all of that. It's like, wait a minute.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   God said he was going to die and he didn't die. You know, is that God's will? What is God's will?
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Right? I think R.C. Sproul probably does the best
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   job in describing that. I forget which book
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   that's in. But do some research. It's in there.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   I forgot where it is. Right? I think he describes
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   it as God's expressed will and his hidden will. Right? I'll just leave it at that.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Okay. Chapter 39.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Hezekiah foolishly shows all the treasures. So basically the foolishness of
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Hezekiah is, now that, again, this happens after the Assyrians are conquered.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Right? He's relaxed. Right?
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   And so now he feels safe enough. He's like, hey, you know, now that Assyria is
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   out of the way, we want to make friends with the Babylonians. So
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   what was the sin? Was it because he was boasting? Right?
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   Was it because he was proud? I think behind it, Hezekiah
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   had the same reason why he was trying to get alliance with the Egyptians.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Now the Assyrians are gone, you know, was it going to hurt
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   allying with the Babylonians? They are the ones who seem to be coming in power.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   So this may have been a political maneuver to
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   get alliance. And this is exactly what God was prophesying
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   against. Don't put your confidence in man. And this
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   seems like that he was beginning to open that door. He's like, oh, since these guys are
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   gone and God delivered us from them, so he allows the Babylonians
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   to come and shows them all of this. Like, oh, why did you do that? And it was such a grievous sin
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   that they come in, they see all the treasures, and they covet it. So when they
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   become super powers, hey, remember all that treasure that Hezekiah
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   showed us? And they come in and they get all of that. So they take the most choiced things
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   in the land, even the people and the cattle, all of that, and they take it into Babylonian, all because
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   of this sin. Right? Because you open that door again.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   And so, you know, again that's where chapter 39 ends, and then we'll
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   jump into chapter 40 next week. But again, this is the sin
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   of mankind. You know, we talk about sanctification,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   and this is at the core of sanctification. Our
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   constant dependence and glorifying of man over God.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Romans chapter 1. Constant dependent
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   and reliance and glorifying of man instead of
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   God. Walking by sight and not by
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   faith. If you really think about it, God has one
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   lesson. God has one lesson.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   If you remain in Me, you live. Apart from Me,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   you bear no fruit. Right? And fruit is not
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   just, you know, you have life and then there's, fruit is kind of like
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   the decoration. The fruit is life. Right? Fruit is not
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   just like, oh, okay, you have a great tree, and then some trees don't have fruit.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   No, if you don't have fruit, it's a dead tree. Right? Bad tree,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   bad fruit. So He's talking about you cannot bear fruit.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   He's not simply talking about evangelism and memorizing Scripture
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   and you know, like mission work. He says if you don't have fruit, you don't have
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   life. So when Jesus says, "If you don't abide in Me, you cannot bear fruit." He's
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   saying, "If you don't abide in Me, you can't live." Right? So that's
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   the same lesson. Look at Israel. Go back and read
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   the Old Testament, New Testament, all through the Revelation. It's the same
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   lesson. If you abide in Him, if you are near Him, there's life.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   If you're away from Him, there's death. Right? So again,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   that's, again, Hezekiah is making that mistake. It's like, now that he feels
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   safe, it's like, oh, okay, let's connect with the Babylonians, not knowing
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   that that's going to lead to destruction. Okay?
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   All right. Chapter 40, I almost, I was tempted
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   to just do Chapter 40 this week because
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   it's one of the, my, Chapter 40, 41 is one of my favorite chapters
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   in probably the whole Bible. I have a whole testimony behind Chapter 40
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   I'm not going to get into. But if we did that, it would take way too
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   long. So I strongly encourage you, especially those
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   of you who have been kind of wrestling, like, oh, this is too hard. Chapter 40 is
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   not hard at all. Right? Just read it for what it is. It's one of those passages
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   that you probably want to just memorize, Chapter 40, 41.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   And so take some time, like really do quiet time through that, and really
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   like be saturated with it so that when we dive into it,
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   it would make a lot more sense to you. Okay? All right.
