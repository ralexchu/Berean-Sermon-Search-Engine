[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240]   If you guys have your Bibles with you, please turn with me to 2 Peter, and I'm going to
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.000]   read just the first four verses of 2 Peter, and it'll be projected up overhead.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.280]   So take a minute, or take a second, to go to 2 Peter, verses 1 through 4.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:32.140]   Simon Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received a
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.520]   faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.160]   Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, seeing
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.420]   that his divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness.
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.840]   Through the true knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and excellence.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.040]   For by these he has granted to us his precious and magnificent promises, so that by them
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.800]   you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.200]   world by lust.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.200]   Let's pray together.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:20.600]   Lord, would you speak and feed your people this morning, and that we would become just
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.560]   all the more appreciative of our lives in Christ?
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.560]   And Lord, that that appreciation would overflow into lives that shine brightly for you and
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.280]   for your kingdom.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.440]   Help us to receive your word, to be challenged by it, to be changed by it, and help us to
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.280]   grow more and more just hungry to feed more each and every week.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.960]   So we thank you for giving us the opportunity to gather today.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.480]   We pray just for your grace and your blessings over our time together as you say we pray.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.920]   So well, first off, I just want to say thank you to my church family for praying for us
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.140]   and loving on me and my wife and the kids, especially over the past 14 months.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.120]   By the grace and kindness of God and the support and love of the church, I am completely cancer
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120]   free.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.400]   I was diagnosed, for those of you guys who are visiting, with stage 3C colorectal cancer
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   back in December 2019.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   And now I'm done with all my treatments.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.240]   And as most of you guys do know, the last step of the treatments was a couple weeks
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.800]   ago at the end of February.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.200]   And I took most of March off just to recover and rest.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.920]   So now I'm back, fully healthy, running around pretending to be busy.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.080]   Actually, no, I am busy, but trying to look the part.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.320]   God's answered many of your prayers in the affirmative.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.260]   And I'm much indebted to this church family for all the love and the care.
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.800]   We literally had like 14 months straight of a minimum of two meals delivered to our home.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.120]   I received at the very least one physical snail mail letter written just to encourage
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.720]   me to say and remind me that people are praying.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.800]   And that's not even including all the texts and the emails and stuff.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.240]   And so thank you.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.160]   It's been a good year.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.880]   And one of the strangely wonderful things about cancer is that you come face to face
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.400]   with your mortality.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.480]   And I don't say like wonderful facetiously because there are aspects of it that are horrible.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.880]   But being reminded that you might possibly die very soon is spiritually a very powerful
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.880]   thing.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.960]   I'm in my 40s.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.760]   And normally in your 40s, you don't think about death too much.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.120]   But I remember we've had quite a few funerals of our church family members' families just
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.800]   over the course of this year.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.920]   And I remember at one of the first ones shortly after my diagnosis just watching the casket,
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.520]   singing the hymn with the deceased persons like family and friends.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.540]   And I actually was imagining my body being lowered into the casket.
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.200]   And it wasn't like a morbid depressing thought.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.760]   It was the first time I had that thought.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.700]   But it was actually rather like a sober reflection on my reality.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.720]   So that reflection caused me to just want to just live better, to be better, and with
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.760]   the remainder of my time.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.040]   And because of the size of the tumor and the staging of my cancer, those first few days
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.060]   I was bracing for the worst.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.640]   And I had a lot of time, especially those first few days, to think about death.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.920]   I had a lot of time to think about the remainder of my life.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.700]   And I was forced to think through how I would live my life if I had like a year remaining.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.620]   If my end was near, how would I maximize the time I had left?
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.400]   What would I emphasize to my kids?
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.540]   What would I preach to you?
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.720]   What would I be so eager to press upon those closest to me?
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.480]   So with death on my mind, there was a sense of urgency with which I wanted to live my
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.180]   life.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.500]   And there were many things that I felt so compelled to share, to preach, and to communicate.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.260]   For the Apostle Peter, it wasn't cancer, but rather his trial and his looming execution.
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.700]   He knew he didn't have much time left.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.940]   And I'm going to read verse 14 and 15 of this, the beginning of the epistle for you.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:49.580]   "Knowing that the laying aside of my earthly dwelling is imminent, as also our Lord Jesus
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.620]   Christ has made clear to me.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.540]   And I will also be diligent that at any time after my departure you will be able to call
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.240]   these things to mind."
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.480]   So Peter's writing as he's nearing the end of his life.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.380]   He knows that he will soon return home to be with his Lord.
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.820]   He knows his time is almost up, so he's writing with urgency.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.180]   And he wants to make absolutely crystal clear how he wants the church to carry on this gospel
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.300]   ministry baton after he's gone.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.800]   So he wants them to know what to prioritize.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.500]   He wants them to know what to fight for.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.920]   He wants them to know how to fight, what kind of things to abstain from.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.380]   And he makes very clear in 2 Peter the priorities of the church and the priorities of his saints.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.940]   And he tells the churches to be very careful.
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.660]   He explicitly points out that the looming dangers, what they are, that threaten the
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.040]   church.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.620]   And he reminds them of the fact that this corrupted world and all that is in this corrupted
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.340]   world will be utterly destroyed by fire.
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.100]   So 2 Peter is very intense.
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.100]   It's actually probably one of the most intense books of the New Testament.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:05.140]   So in 61 very intense verses, the apostle Peter gives what appears to be his last will
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.180]   and testament to his spiritual children.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:14.180]   And so much of what Peter wrote to the churches in Asia Minor and in this second epistle,
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.340]   they do apply to us as well.
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.460]   So we're going to take a look at that.
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.740]   So this morning I'm going to take a look at primarily the first four verses found in the
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.020]   introduction.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.100]   And then I will walk you through some of the major themes of the whole of 2 Peter because
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:35.660]   the contents of the entire letter are weighty, they're intense, and of supreme importance.
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:41.360]   So I'm going to give you an outline up front, who we are.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.140]   So Peter first says this is who we are, this is our identity.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.060]   And then he continues to what we have been given, verses 2 to 4.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.280]   And third, what kind of people we ought to be.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.740]   So who we are, what we've been given, and what kind of people we ought to be, especially
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.220]   in the light of the fact that everything is going to crash and burn.
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:09.500]   So who we are, or in our context, who the apostle Peter is and who he's addressing.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:16.020]   So it says in verse 1, "Simon Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ."
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.380]   So the letter opens with the apostle introducing himself as Simeon Peter.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.180]   Simeon is a Hebrew form of Simon.
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.500]   If you guys are using the ESV, that's not a typo.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.060]   There is an E in there.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.780]   The ESV actually has translated it correctly, while the NASB did not.
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.580]   So one point for the ESV.
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:39.820]   Simeon Peter, so he calls himself a bondservant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.860]   And bondservant is a very nice way of saying slave.
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:49.220]   And the word slave in our modern context is very negative, very incendiary, and it carries
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.780]   a lot of baggage.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:57.340]   So because it carries so much baggage, most English translations, they use the more neutral
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.620]   feeling bondservant.
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:06.200]   But the word doulos really does mean slave, one whose sole purpose is to obey his master
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.620]   and to be useful to his master.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:15.920]   So in a worldly sense, the word slave feels super offensive and insulting because no one
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.300]   likes to think that he only exists to be used.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.580]   In a worldly sense, it's offensive.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:27.020]   But I wonder how different the word slave would feel if history was full of examples
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:34.940]   of selfless, sacrificial, compassionate, generous, protective, and loving slave masters.
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.340]   Which we don't have much of, right?
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:43.340]   But if a slave had a master who was always looking out for his good, I think there would
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.740]   be many volunteer slaves, right?
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.380]   And actually, that's our reality.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:57.320]   We serve a good shepherd, a good master, one who would even elevate us slaves to the level
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.980]   of friend, brother, co-worker, and even co-heir.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:08.540]   So spiritually, slave of Jesus Christ is not a position of humiliation but one of honor.
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.540]   Why?
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.180]   Because the master is good.
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.520]   So you and I also are slaves.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.100]   So here's what Peter is saying when he's saying that he is a doulos of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:26.380]   First, he is inalienably possessed by Jesus Christ.
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.340]   So he is a possession.
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.540]   He is owned.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:36.100]   Second, Peter says he's unqualifiedly at the disposal of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:41.180]   So he has been created and called to be used and to be useful.
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:47.440]   Third, owing and unquestioning obedience to Jesus Christ.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.980]   If Christ commands, he does.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.980]   No questions asked.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.740]   Christ is Savior and God.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.500]   He is creator.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.620]   Peter is creation.
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:03.260]   So and fourthly, when Peter says, "I am a doulos of Christ," he's saying he's constantly
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.580]   in the service of Christ.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.060]   So Peter gets no breaks, no holidays, no PTO.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:14.260]   So he is permanently indentured.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.060]   And the apostle Peter is calling himself a slave of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:24.500]   And that title for him is good because Jesus Christ is supremely good.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.820]   Christ is Peter's master and Lord.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.600]   Peter is a slave and a mouthpiece of his good Lord.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.280]   His life is meaningless outside of Christ.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.720]   His sole purpose in this life is to honor Christ.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.820]   And this purpose costs Peter everything.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.340]   But actually if you read through 1 and 2 Peter, there is absolutely no hint of bitterness,
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.660]   regret, insecurity, or shame.
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.980]   He does not care that following Christ has cost him everything.
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.340]   He is a slave and messenger of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.440]   Christ has been and will continue to be his Lord for all eternity.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.540]   So Simeon Peter, a bondservant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.300]   Slave and apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:13.580]   And after introducing himself in the letter, Peter turns his attention to the audience.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:21.220]   It reads, "To those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.340]   of our God and Savior Jesus Christ."
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.560]   So he's addressing this letter to all the other fellow slaves who like him have been
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.660]   purchased at a very expensive price, the blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:40.660]   So 2 Corinthians 5, 21, "He made him who knew no sin be sin on our behalf so that we might
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.500]   become the righteousness of God in him."
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.860]   So the believers in the churches of Asia Minor had received the same faith.
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:54.020]   They had received, they had responded in the same way to the gospel of Jesus.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.300]   They were, they who were poor were made rich because of the voluntary poverty of Jesus
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.020]   Christ.
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:06.580]   And though they weren't especially called to be apostles, these Christians, their faith
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:12.900]   in Christ made them bondservants of Christ just like Peter.
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.820]   We too are bondservants.
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.980]   We too are slaves.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:22.100]   Jesus Christ cannot be Savior only and not Lord.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.800]   Does this make sense?
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.860]   Jesus Christ cannot be our Savior only and not Lord.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.220]   He is not the means to our goals.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.620]   Pleasing him is our goal.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.620]   We are his means.
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.980]   And I'm hoping you're tracking along.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.700]   And Peter's call and burden is our call and burden.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.740]   Peter's master and Lord is our master and Lord.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:49.700]   And this is the identity of every person who would call himself a Christian.
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.780]   And you cannot land, you cannot but land on that conclusion if you're reading through
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.680]   the scriptures.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:01.460]   You cannot accept Christ as Savior and reject him as Lord over your life.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.740]   Are you guys tracking along?
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.620]   Why do you call me Lord?
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.540]   Lord and do not do what I say.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.700]   Luke 6, 46, words of Jesus.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.400]   So has your soul been purchased by the precious blood of Christ?
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.580]   Have you been restored to your creator?
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.300]   Have you become in him the righteousness of God?
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.860]   If Jesus is your Lord, you have no rights.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.180]   I'll say that again.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:34.460]   If Jesus is your Lord, you have zero rights.
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.100]   You have no purpose outside of Christ.
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:42.940]   And your primary and chief aim in life is to proclaim the excellencies of him who calls
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.260]   you out of darkness and into his wonderful light.
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.260]   Okay?
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.260]   So this is your identity.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.260]   This is my identity.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.500]   This is who we are.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.380]   We are douloi of Jesus Christ.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.380]   Amen?
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.380]   All right.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.540]   So you and I exist to serve our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.980]   And it's very good this morning to be first reminded of this truth because modern-day
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:10.660]   church culture kind of nudges us to think that Jesus Christ exists to serve us.
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.540]   And we need to make something very clear.
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.540]   It's the other way around.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.540]   All right?
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.540]   So who are we?
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:21.460]   We are bond servants of Jesus Christ, and may he do with us as he deems fit.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.020]   Amen?
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:27.860]   So this brings us to our second point, what we have been given.
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.780]   So for the who we are part of the sermon outline, it's all there in verse 1.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.340]   So it's not hard to catch.
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.340]   All right?
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:40.060]   But the what we have been given part, it's a little bit more challenging because we have
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.300]   to look at all the verses from, or two through four.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:48.100]   So I'm going to reread verses 2 to 4 for you.
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:53.420]   Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, seeing
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:59.540]   that his divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness through the
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.260]   true knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and excellence.
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:09.580]   For by these he has granted to us his precious and magnificent promises so that by them you
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:14.500]   may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.100]   world by lust.
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:22.580]   So in the Greek, there's grammatical awkwardness all over the place in these three verses.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:29.060]   And in the Greek, in the new section, is clearly starting at verse 3, but Peter has let the
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.760]   grammar flow from verse 2.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.460]   And there's also no main verb in these verses.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.880]   And Peter goes back and forth from you to us, us to you, you to us.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.980]   So if you're doing like an inductive Bible study through these verses, you would come
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.540]   up with a lot of grammatical questions.
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.580]   And the English translations have smoothed out things a little bit in these verses so
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.220]   they read easier.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:56.380]   But if you compare all the English translations, there's commas and semicolons and periods
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.380]   in different places.
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.380]   All right?
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.340]   So the grammar is a little awkward and complex.
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:06.660]   But syntactically, there are two things that are highlighted, okay, in these verses.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.020]   And they come after the words "has granted to us."
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.020]   All right?
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.500]   "Has granted to us."
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.500]   First, the term "everything" is in the emphatic position.
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:25.660]   So Peter is stressing and emphasizing how God's divine power has granted to all believers
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.180]   everything they need.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.300]   And everything pertaining to what?
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.220]   To life and godliness.
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:37.020]   So you can actually interpret that as a godly life, and that would not be incorrect.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:42.020]   So there are a lot of little couplets in 2 Peter where two words are used to kind of
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.380]   describe one idea, okay?
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.820]   And this couplet is the first one.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.500]   Life and godliness or godly life.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:56.020]   So God has given to the apostles, to the churches in Asia Minor, and to all of us who know Him,
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.640]   everything we need for life and for godliness.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.260]   And everything we need for a godly life.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.040]   So what is Peter saying?
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.940]   You lack nothing.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.540]   You have everything you need.
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.060]   You want to know God?
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.580]   You have everything you need.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.140]   You want to please God?
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.720]   You have everything you need.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.600]   You want to lead others to God?
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.240]   You have everything you need.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.540]   And that's consistent with what we see all over the scriptures, and this is nothing new.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.540]   Okay?
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:31.200]   So the apostle Paul points to us, to this truth, that God's grace is sufficient, 2 Corinthians
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.840]   12 9, that he can do all things through Christ who strengthens him, Philippians 4 13.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.080]   In Psalm 23, what does King David say?
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.640]   He says, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.680]   And I like how the NIV translated it.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.640]   The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.640]   Okay?
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.400]   So hopefully this isn't new teaching for you.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.240]   Hopefully this has been and is familiar biblical truth for you.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.040]   You have everything you need.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.480]   Okay, let me repeat that.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.640]   You have everything you need.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.080]   And we sing about this all the time, right?
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.480]   We sang about it just 15 minutes ago.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.820]   Your grace is enough.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.700]   Your grace is enough.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.240]   Your grace is enough for me, right?
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.800]   And hopefully when you sang it, you weren't lying and you weren't just mindlessly and
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.880]   habitually moving your lips, especially if you had like your praise face on.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.760]   You're like, "Your grace is enough for me."
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.680]   Hopefully you were really saying that as a confession.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.440]   And this isn't a song that we sing as much now, but you know that song?
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.640]   Christ is enough for me.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.880]   Nod your heads if you guys know that song.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:53.120]   Christ is enough for me.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.560]   Everything I need is in you.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.360]   And whenever you sing these kinds of things, it doesn't like cause you to be like, "That's
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.360]   a lie."
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.360]   No.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:09.960]   So this is a truth that you guys already know academically, but do you really believe this?
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:16.560]   Second Peter 2, 1-2, Peter warns that there have always been distorters of God's truth
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.760]   and that there will always be false teachers among the people and that there will be destructive
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.960]   heresies that try and infiltrate the church.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.840]   So I'm going to read this for you.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:31.520]   But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:38.320]   among you who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the master who bought
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.800]   them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.520]   Many will follow their sensuality and because of them, the way of the truth will be maligned.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:55.960]   And you know the tricky thing about heresies and lies in general, heresies contain a whole
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.060]   lot of truth with a slight distortion.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.400]   If heresies were very obviously heresies, it would be a pathetic heresy.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.400]   You guys following that?
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:13.760]   Heresy, a lot of what is contained in there is truth with a perversion and a distortion
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.800]   of an element of it.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.520]   And there have been all kinds of destructive heresies that have battered the walls of the
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.800]   churches over the years.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.520]   And here's one destructive heresy that I believe that many in our pews today are tempted
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.520]   to believe.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.840]   Okay, and here it is.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.800]   I don't have enough.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.280]   That's a lie.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.080]   I don't have enough.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.960]   I don't have enough money.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.500]   I don't have enough time.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.960]   I don't have enough knowledge.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.420]   I don't have enough worth.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.160]   And the list goes on and on.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:57.120]   And so many church people work very hard and expend a lot of energy trying to gain more,
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:03.760]   trying to attain more, trying to buy more, trying to move out of state perhaps.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.760]   Why?
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:10.440]   Because a part of them has bought into the lie that they don't have enough or that their
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:16.480]   circumstances are not enough to make them happy or useful to the Lord.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.800]   What does Peter emphasize here?
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.560]   His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.180]   The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.620]   The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:37.480]   You have everything you need for life and godliness.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.420]   Do you believe that?
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:44.440]   You may not have a lot in your bank account, but you have everything you need for your
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.720]   life of godliness and gospel ministry.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.120]   And I know many of you love Romans chapter 8, verses 31 to 32 are two of my favorite
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.680]   verses in this chapter.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.760]   It reads, "What then shall we say to these things?
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.560]   If God is for us, who is against us?
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:09.720]   He who did not spare his own son but delivered him over for us all, how will he not also
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:14.840]   with him freely give us all things?"
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:20.240]   So hopefully when you're singing, "Your grace is enough," or "Christ is enough for me,"
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.860]   you're not just honoring him with your lips while your heart is super far away.
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:32.180]   Do you believe that his divine power has given you everything you need for your life and
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.180]   godliness?
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:39.460]   So the second thing that has been granted to believers is God's precious and magnificent
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.640]   promises.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:46.360]   So we're not told exactly what the content of the promises is, but the focus of these
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:51.180]   promises is our participation in the divine nature and escape from corruption that is
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.540]   in the world.
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.720]   The world is cursed.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.020]   It's going to burn.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:01.300]   We escape this corruption, we escape this destruction, and we partake in the divine
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.300]   nature.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.820]   And we gain a little bit more insight into this at the end of the letter in chapter 3
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.300]   verse 13 where the word "promise" is used once again.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.140]   So I'm going to read that for you.
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:16.220]   But according to his promise, we are looking for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.080]   dwells.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.020]   So we have been granted everything we need for life and godliness.
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.820]   We have received promises of salvation and a great future hope.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:30.080]   And all of these things, all of our sufficiency, all of our blessings come through a true and
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.140]   full knowledge of God.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.340]   So the word "knowledge" will keep coming up again and again in the entirety of Peter's
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.340]   letter.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.140]   So I'm going to have a slide up here for you, and we'll just read through this real quick.
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:46.180]   Grace and peace in the knowledge of God, through the knowledge of him, in your moral excellence,
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:52.340]   knowledge, and in your knowledge, add such and such a thing, nor unfruitful in the true
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.860]   knowledge of our Lord.
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:25:01.220]   We made known to you, but know this first of all, escaped by the knowledge of the Lord.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.020]   Know this first of all.
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.380]   Knowing this beforehand, be on your guard.
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:10.460]   So the word "knowledge" is very important to the apostle Peter.
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:15.180]   It's used twice here in just this grammatically challenging section, and you'll see it again
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:21.140]   in verses 5, 6, 8, 16, and 20, just in chapter 1.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:26.500]   And this whole epistle ends with a last exhortation to actively grow in the knowledge until the
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.500]   very end.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.980]   So we're in the beginning of the book of 1 Timothy, chapter 3, but grow in the grace
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:35.020]   and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:39.660]   To him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity.
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.260]   Amen.
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:46.740]   So as I've mentioned before, grammatically, this is not an easy verse to fully understand,
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:54.040]   but what God has given every believer, what you and I have received, is very easy to discern.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.560]   So he has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:05.080]   He has granted to us his precious and magnificent promises, and he has granted to us access
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:11.600]   to know him, to know of him, and to be known by him.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.040]   And to know God actually is what eternal life is all about.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.100]   John 17, 3.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:24.640]   This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.140]   have sent.
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:34.200]   And we remind you time and time again, we have everything we need.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.820]   And if you are a child of God, if you put your faith in Christ, eternal life has already
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.640]   started.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.780]   So here your knowledge of God may be like that of a poor reflection, but one day you
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.580]   will know fully and see him face to face.
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:53.040]   Eternal life does not start the moment you expire your Lord into the casket, "Oh, eternal
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.040]   life."
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.040]   That's not where it starts.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:02.960]   It starts with your initial knowledge of the living God.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:10.500]   He is Lord, we are slaves, we have everything we need, we lack nothing.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.060]   Eternal life has already started.
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:19.060]   Our goal in life, our all-encompassing purpose in this life and in the next is to know him
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.380]   and to make him known.
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.460]   Do you believe this?
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:30.480]   Does the way you live your life proclaim this?
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:37.420]   So going back to our outline, who we are is we are slaves of our God and Savior, Jesus
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.920]   Christ.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.920]   What have we been given?
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.700]   We have been given everything that we need for life and godliness.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.780]   And this brings us to our final point.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.460]   What sort of people ought we to be?
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:57.260]   Verse 4 briefly touches upon the truth that we will be partakers of the divine nature.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:02.700]   So there's an already but not yet element here because these promises, though initiated
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:07.220]   here, won't be fully actualized until his promise of a new heaven and a new earth is
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.220]   fulfilled.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:14.100]   So verse 13 of chapter 3, we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth in
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.860]   which righteousness dwells.
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.380]   And I mentioned to you that a destructive heresy many today are tricked into believing
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:24.500]   is I don't have enough.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.620]   Here's another one.
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.500]   This world is our home.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:37.500]   And that's another dangerous lie that you and I cannot be tricked into believing.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:48.220]   This world is our home is a very subtle, destructive lie that many are tempted to buy into.
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.980]   This is not home.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.660]   The Bible says this place is going to crash and burn.
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.060]   So I'm going to read together what the apostle Peter says about what awaits this world.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:02.940]   Okay, so chapter 3, verses 7 and 10.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:08.380]   But by his word, the present heavens and the earth are being reserved for fire, kept for
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:13.100]   the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:17.780]   But the day of the Lord will come like a thief in which the heavens will pass away with a
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:24.540]   roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat and the earth and its works will
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.020]   be burned up.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.420]   So I don't have enough.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.400]   That is a lie.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.460]   This world is our home.
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.100]   That is another lie.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:42.940]   You know what sounds nice but is extremely foolish?
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.700]   Let's make this world a better place.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.140]   Nice but extremely foolish.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:54.500]   It is great folly and unnecessary distraction if you're thinking of expending a lot of energy
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:59.420]   making this world more comfortable, more habitable, and more peaceful.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.860]   Why?
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.300]   It's going to crash and burn.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:12.900]   So trying to make this world a better place is akin to applying beautiful paint on cabinets
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.820]   in a burning house.
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.420]   So I'm not saying that we shouldn't be good stewards or that we shouldn't be salt and
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.860]   light in the world while we are in this world.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:28.660]   What I am saying is that we should put very little hope in this world.
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:34.900]   So I actually wrote a list down of what things I would try to save in the event of a fire.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.020]   I'm going to share that with you.
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:41.420]   If I wake up in the middle of the night, things are burning, what am I going to go and scramble
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.240]   to save?
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.660]   The first thing is photo albums.
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:51.260]   Nod your heads if you guys would do the same, like old photo albums.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:57.940]   Second, legal documents, social security cards, passports, birth certificates.
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.360]   Those things are a hassle to replace, right?
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.200]   I would save legal documents.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.660]   I would go after my laptop because there's important stuff on my laptop.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.580]   Cloud hasn't been updated in about a week and a half, okay?
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.700]   And it's a hassle to try to get a new computer.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.720]   So I would save that.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.440]   I would save my wallet because I need some kind of form of ID.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.620]   We may need my credit cards.
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:21.180]   I will save that.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.940]   I will save my Bible that I've taken notes on, right?
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:28.460]   Because it's hard to replace all of the inspiration that I've gleaned from just my quiet times.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.700]   I would save my Bible.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.540]   I would go after Bailey, our dog, okay?
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.540]   Because she's family.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.700]   She's been with us since 2012.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.440]   So she's been with us for a while, so I would save Bailey.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:46.000]   And I would probably grab our car keys, maybe, if I had some time, because you need a temporary
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.340]   shelter and a mode of transportation.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.360]   So I would save all of these things.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:56.740]   And these are all important and valuable and useful to me.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.000]   And some of these things cannot be replaced.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.180]   And some of these things, though they can be replaced, it's a big old hassle to try
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.100]   to get them replaced.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:09.780]   So it would behoove me to grab if I can't.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:14.020]   So none of you guys are probably thinking I'm gonna fault that guy for grabbing these
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.860]   kinds of things, right?
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.060]   You would save your dog, too.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:23.380]   But if this was the entirety of my list, you would fault me.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.520]   Because what's missing?
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:31.020]   I didn't mention my wife and my kids.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.140]   What about my wife and my kids?
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.840]   So all the other things that I would grab are not unimportant things, and I do hope
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.420]   to get them out of the house.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:43.500]   But in the event I wake up in the middle of the night to a fire, I need to prioritize,
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.500]   okay?
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.460]   I need to prioritize my people.
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.100]   I need to prioritize my wife and my kids, even if my dog perishes.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.100]   She's old anyway.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.660]   She's like 10, right?
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.460]   She's lived a full life.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:02.640]   Even if she were to perish, I would have to go after Becky and the kids first.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.060]   And that's not saying that I don't love Bailey, my dog.
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:09.860]   But I'm going after human family first.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:13.060]   There's a quick priority being done.
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:18.460]   To make the world a better place, what are their foolishness?
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.180]   What backward priorities?
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.980]   The Bible says that this world is going to crash and burn, and that truth is all over
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:30.100]   the pages of Scripture.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.700]   Prioritize.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:39.260]   Give your kids a solid college education, save for your retirement.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.700]   Help the world get rid of racism.
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:46.780]   Help the poor be a voice for the oppressed.
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.300]   And these are not unimportant things.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:58.100]   But our priority with the short time that we have in this life, get souls restored to
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.100]   their creator.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.900]   Get people saved.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:11.300]   And remember, his divine nature has granted to you everything pertaining to this task.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.700]   Charles Spurgeon once said it well, "Great numbers of persons in the churches have no
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.140]   concern about eternal things.
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:22.260]   They care more about their cats and their dogs than their souls."
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:29.740]   And perhaps Spurgeon is describing some of us sitting here today.
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.940]   So what is Peter saying here?
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:36.540]   First, we are slaves of God and our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.300]   Second, what have we been given?
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:42.060]   We've been given everything we need pertaining to life and godliness.
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:46.500]   We've been given his precious promises that were a seal.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.420]   He does not go back on his promises.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:54.020]   We were given these things, and what sort of people in response ought we to be?
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:59.180]   And in 2 Peter, there's a ton of applications that Apostle Peter lays out, a ton of exhortations,
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.740]   but I'll just leave you with a couple.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:05.420]   2 Peter 3, verse 11, 14 and 15.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:09.340]   Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:12.700]   to be in holy conduct and godliness?
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:17.940]   Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by him in
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:24.860]   peace, spotless and blameless, and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation.
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.860]   So what is he saying?
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:31.740]   Keep yourself unstained by the world and get to work rescuing souls.
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:36.300]   And I'll take you also to the verses immediately following the verses that I read in the beginning,
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.940]   verses 5 through 7.
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:46.100]   Now for this reason also, applying all diligence in your faith, supply moral excellence, in
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:52.580]   your moral excellence knowledge, and in your knowledge self-control, and in your self-control
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:36:00.660]   perseverance, and in your perseverance godliness, and in your godliness brotherly kindness,
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.100]   and in your brotherly kindness love.
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:08.420]   It may be a foolish and distracting endeavor to try to make this world a better place,
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.580]   but we are called to be kind.
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.340]   We are called to love.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:18.620]   But all of that is under the umbrella of knowing God and making him known because there is
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.340]   no hope outside of Christ.
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:25.300]   That has to take central priority in your life.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:30.940]   You know as I was meditating upon 2 Peter chapters 1, 1 through 4, my mind kept going
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.060]   to Psalm 23.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.880]   You guys know that Psalm, like the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.940]   And to the song, Shepherd of my soul.
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:48.820]   And there's a line in there that says, "Be it in a quiet pasture or by a gentle stream,
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.740]   the shepherd of my soul is by my side.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:37:00.260]   Should I face a mighty mountain or a valley dark and deep, the shepherd of my soul will
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.700]   be my guide."
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:06.820]   So in life there are seasons where it feels like there are more mighty mountains or dark
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.980]   valleys than there are quiet pastures.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:15.860]   For me the 14 months fighting cancer felt like a mighty mountain.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:22.180]   And sometimes life is full of little inconveniences and challenges.
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:24.980]   How do we respond in worship and trust?
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:29.820]   How do we conduct ourselves in holiness and godly conduct?
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:36.660]   If every trial, every inconvenience, every person even is in your life on purpose, how
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.980]   do we respond?
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:44.660]   In all things we seek to know him and to make him known.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.980]   His sheep hear his voice.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:52.780]   He is a good shepherd and he has other sheep that are not yet of this fold.
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.700]   You guys following me?
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:01.540]   He has other sheep that are not yet of this fold.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:08.460]   So in your knowing him, in your trusting him, our call is to help others to know him and
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.460]   to trust him.
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:14.240]   And you and I have been adequately equipped to do this.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.940]   You lack nothing.
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:22.300]   A lot of things both big and little, both good and bad have happened in just the last
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.060]   five weeks.
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:30.900]   So on February 26th, so I went in for my final surgery and up until that point, you know,
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.180]   I had an ostomy bag on me.
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:40.820]   And February 26th I was going to get the stoma taken down and I was going to go back to life
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:41.820]   as normal.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.980]   That was my final step in the cancer journey.
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.840]   And the first time I was there, I was there for about four days.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:54.120]   And so I had taken a lot of work to do because I was thinking, hey, this whole cancer treatment's
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.980]   been easy.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:59.180]   After surgery I'm just going to, you know, do memory verses.
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:01.180]   I'll do Bible study and all of these things.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.220]   And I realized it's kind of hard with all these wires strapped to your fingers and your
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.900]   body and the drugs running through your system.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.740]   So I said, okay, this time around I'm just going to kind of relax.
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:14.140]   Okay, so I was expecting three or four days where I could just sleep.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:19.820]   I could actually get to a couple TV shows and I was ready to relax.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:24.940]   And I was sitting there, laying there, and then all of a sudden they wheel in another
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:26.700]   dude in my room.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:30.380]   And I was thinking, man, I had peace and quiet, but they're reeling in this other dude, this
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.740]   18-year-old kid who just had his appendix about to burst.
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:37.820]   So they did an emergency surgery and then he was there.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:44.460]   And he, I mean, he was a very nice kid, but he was 18.
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.620]   And he was talking about, he was calling his friends for three, four hours at a time, talking
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.720]   about all kinds of silly things that 18-year-old kids talk about.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.460]   He was watching his TV shows at a very high volume.
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.060]   And at first I was like, Lord, you know I need to rest.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.740]   What's going on?
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:07.500]   But then the thought that came to mind was if every person is on purpose, every meeting
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:13.500]   is a divine appointment, and I am called to save souls, and he has equipped me for everything
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:17.580]   pertaining to life and godliness, I need to use this to my advantage.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.100]   He's sitting right next to me.
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.180]   So we just talked about life.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.900]   I talked about how I got cancer.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.860]   I talked about my wife and my kids.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.740]   And he just nodded along and then called his girlfriend again.
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:32.340]   So I don't know what happened since then.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.340]   And then after that, I had jury duty.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:40.860]   A couple, like a week later, I was thinking, oh man, I got to take advantage of my last
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.680]   few days off work because once I get back to church it's going to be busy.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.180]   And the last few times I did jury duty, it ended really quick.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.380]   But this time around for some reason, I was there all the way until 4 p.m. and then they
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.700]   said come back tomorrow.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.420]   And I was like, man, this is so inconvenient.
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:03.380]   And I just started striking up a conversation with a lady named Deb, and I made a new friend
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.620]   named Alex.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:11.500]   And each step of the way, I was thinking, man, there is no shortage of opportunities
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.220]   where God wants me to minister.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:19.820]   I don't know if anything happened after that.
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:27.260]   And just a month ago, on March 11th, I got a phone call saying that my mom in Korea had
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.540]   passed away.
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:34.140]   So she got diagnosed with -- she was worried about me, and in December, I got a phone call
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:37.060]   saying that she got diagnosed with lung and bone and breast cancer.
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:40.300]   A little bit had gone into her brain, so it was a little bit urgent.
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.820]   And I was thinking, you know, I need to get to Korea.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.260]   I got to try to figure out how to get there.
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:49.580]   And I was calling the surgeon, trying to see would I be okay to travel with this ostomy
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.820]   bag.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.780]   And then COVID hit Korea pretty hard.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.560]   And so I wouldn't have been able to go see my mom.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:02.220]   And then exactly one month ago, from today, March 11th, she passed away.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:08.680]   And the thing that I was thinking was, you know, the emotional highs and lows are there.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:15.660]   But the truth of my reality is that His divine power has given me everything I need for life
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.660]   and godliness.
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:20.440]   And the truth of the reality of this life is that it's going to end.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:27.500]   But she's with the Lord.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:38.240]   And my main duty in all of this is just trust and obey, to put my hope in Christ, to know
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:44.840]   Him, and to make Him known.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:51.120]   His divine power has given me everything I need to respond to every hurdle, every high
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:43:00.800]   mountain, every low valley in a way that gives Him glory.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.920]   In every trial, in every inconvenience, in every joy, success, and victory, in every
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:12.800]   relationship, what is your purpose, O beloved slave?
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:19.160]   You are to trust Him, to know Him, and make Him known.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.160]   You know what?
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.040]   That Him, trust and obey, for there's no other way, what?
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.600]   To be happy in Jesus.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.840]   So to the shepherd of your soul, give Him full control.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.800]   And wherever He may lead you, follow and follow well.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:41.620]   Be it in a quiet pasture or by a gentle stream, remember that the shepherd of your soul is
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.160]   by your side.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:48.240]   You lack nothing.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:55.280]   His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness through the
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:02.440]   true knowledge of Him who called us by His glory and excellence.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.920]   You lack nothing.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:13.840]   And as our good shepherd leads you through the highs and lows of this life, worship,
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:18.920]   trust, obey, know Him, and make Him known.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.920]   Amen?
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:24.920]   Let's pray.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:45.600]   Father, we need Your help to know how to properly give You the worship that You do in every
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.840]   situation, in every circumstance.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:55.320]   And we pray that as we walk with You, that You would give us greater wisdom, greater
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:45:04.160]   insight, greater faith, so that as we walk with You, we will grow in excellence in knowing
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.120]   how to trust and obey.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:11.400]   Lord, we thank You for Your kindness in our lives.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:17.520]   We thank You for Your patience.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:22.040]   Help us to reflect You in a way that is so pleasing.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.800]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
