[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960]   If you can turn your Bibles with me, Hebrews chapter 12 verses 12 and 13.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.560]   Okay, Hebrews chapter 12 verses 12 and 13.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.080]   You'll be reading the NASB.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.160]   "Therefore strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.080]   Make straight paths for your feet so that the limb which is lame may not be put out
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.120]   of joint but rather be healed."
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.600]   Let's pray.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.920]   Heavenly Father we pray for your blessing, we pray for your guidance by your word.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.680]   I pray that our hearts may be molded Lord God and that your word would guide and lead
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.400]   us and sanctify your church.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:53.440]   Lord, we know that the preaching is just words Lord God, unless you ordain it and illuminate
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.360]   us and cause us Lord to see who you are.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.640]   So we pray for guidance, we pray Lord that your grace would allow us Lord to hear and
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.760]   to practice and to be changed.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.360]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:16.400]   Yesterday myself, Elder James and Pastor Mark, we did a podcast together on the subject of
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.100]   deconstructionism.
[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.840]   So some of you guys who may have heard the term or maybe have been hearing it around
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.080]   and basically what's going on, again the latest trend is for people to re-examine their
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.600]   faith and possibly even questioning the fundamentals of what we believe.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.400]   Like is the Bible real, you know, are the miracles real, is the church necessary?
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.840]   And so, and this was sparked by a few well-known pastors who basically denied their faith and
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.840]   walked away from Christianity, basically condemning the Christianity that they belong to and they
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.000]   participated in and even led and many people came to Christ through them.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.180]   And so because of that and I think, you know, with it basically triggered a lot of people
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.040]   just almost encouraging people to go back and re-examine their faith.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.320]   I think re-examining our faith is always necessary because we do live in a somewhat Christian
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.240]   culture at least where we live and, you know, you sometimes feel pressure to become a Christian
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.040]   when you're in college and then you make a bunch of Christian friends, maybe you came
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.000]   from a Christian home and as a result of that being in church was a knee-jerk reaction and
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.160]   maybe you never seriously examined what you truly believed.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.880]   But in that process, the danger that we are seeing now is that it's almost encouraged,
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.560]   that it's almost normal that we go back and revisit.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.800]   Is the Bible even real?
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   Does God even exist?
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.040]   Did the resurrection really happen?
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.600]   And in that context, many people are beginning to realize that maybe they weren't believers
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.480]   to begin with.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.600]   I think most of us, if you've been a Christian for any period of time, you can probably name
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.480]   at least one person or maybe many people that at one point maybe you looked up to and you
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.000]   ran the race with are no longer walking with God.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.540]   Maybe a professor, maybe a Sunday school teacher, maybe your youth pastor, maybe a good friend
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.840]   of yours that at one point you were excited and you're walking with God and by all definitions
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.080]   of what the Bible teaches what a Christian is, they are no longer walking with God.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.500]   They're not believers in Christ.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.480]   This is not anything new.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.720]   This is not a new phenomenon in what's going on in our generation that all of a sudden
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.160]   2,000 years later after the death and resurrection of Christ, this new thing of deconstructionism
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.160]   is going on.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.040]   This has happened from the very first century, from the very beginning.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.040]   Jesus warned.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.680]   He said that some seeds are going to fall on certain soils and they're going to look
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.800]   like they're going to bear fruit for a period, but then because they don't have any foundation,
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.640]   they're going to disappear.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.440]   Some of them are going to fall on soils and they just disbelieve and they walk away.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.680]   And then there's some soils where the seed falls on the third soil and in the beginning
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.200]   it looks like they're bearing fruit, but because of the worries and concern and deceitfulness
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.400]   of this world, their faith gets choked out and as a result they die.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.240]   So whether you call it deconstructionism or backsliding or fading or slipping, whatever
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.040]   you want to call it, it is nothing new to our generation.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.260]   The Bible tells us that this will happen.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.060]   And so people who are going through this process are only coming to realize that maybe they
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.360]   never really had faith to begin with.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.480]   And this is why it's necessary for us to examine and make sure that we are truly anchored
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.460]   in Christ, that our dependency is not the community, that our dependency is not our
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.000]   support group and our family, friends, or our tradition, but do I really believe in
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Christ?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Am I anchored in Christ?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.920]   That even if everybody that I know falls away, that I am anchored in Christ.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.000]   Even if the biggest waves come, I am anchored in Christ.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.520]   The text that we're looking at this morning is in the context of the larger context where
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.760]   the author has been trying to get the readers to continue to take their faith seriously
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.280]   and not drift.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.560]   Now they weren't guilty of apostasy.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.760]   They weren't guilty of waking up one morning and saying, "You know what?
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.160]   I don't want Jesus and I'm going to run toward my old life."
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.200]   That's not what was happening.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.340]   The constant warning is do not drift, do not neglect, do not drift.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:45.240]   Because most people who experience deconstructionism or backsliding usually happens way before
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.760]   they're ever public about it.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.760]   That was probably happening behind the scene where they were questioning.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.160]   Maybe they weren't walking right with God.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.920]   Maybe there was a sin in their life that they weren't confessing that caused a strain or
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.000]   quenching of the spirit.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.960]   And instead of realizing that maybe something in them was flawed, they turned that table
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.520]   around and began to point to the church or the pastors or to the Bible itself saying
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.640]   maybe they're wrong and I'm not the cause.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.360]   It is in that context that this author has been going through Christology chapter after
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.520]   chapter after chapter that we do not drift from this.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.840]   And so we're in chapter 12 where it's saying, "Considering all of this, therefore," so we
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.520]   have such a great of witnesses that has gone before us, "to lay aside every encumbrance
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.760]   and sin which so easily entangles us so that we do not continue to drift."
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.760]   And then in verse 12 that we're looking at where it says, "Therefore, considering what
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:47.800]   Christ has done for us, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble."
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.000]   We have no reason to quit.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.240]   If you are a genuine believer in Christ, there is no reason to quit.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.520]   That's what he means in verse 4 when he said, "You have not yet resisted to the point of
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.560]   shedding blood in your striving against sin."
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.840]   Christ has shed his blood for us.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.000]   Our salvation was given.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.500]   We didn't earn this.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:14.520]   So a genuine Christian has no reason to quit no matter what struggle, no matter what trial
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:21.600]   because Christ knowing our weakness, Christ knowing our struggle has shed his blood for
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   us.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:28.880]   So the only Christian that truly fails in the kingdom of God is the one who quits.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.240]   And so he's encouraging and challenging the church to persevere because it is for that
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.820]   reason that Christ died for us.
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:45.280]   Since we have a God who is perfect, who does not make mistakes, there's no reason to quit.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.840]   Since we have a God who loves us and that even in the most difficult circumstances,
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.800]   it's a proof of our relationship with him.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.400]   So therefore, we don't need to quit.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.600]   Since we have a God that even in our most difficult circumstances are orchestrating
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:05.320]   things for our own good to train us to be more like him, therefore we do not need to
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.320]   quit.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.040]   And that was the point that we were trying to make last week, right, in the passages.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.600]   And here in verse 12 he continues, he says, "Therefore, therefore we believe in a sovereign
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.040]   God who loved us, died for us.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.040]   There's no reason to quit.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.000]   Therefore strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble."
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.920]   Let me stop right here because this is a passage, verse 12 and 13 is a passage that we know
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.920]   well.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.700]   This is kind of like, "Let's get going" type of passage, right?
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.080]   If you're struggling, find out what your weaknesses are and make a list of things that you need
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.720]   to correct and then get things right and then let's do it.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.320]   But before we even get to that, we need to first understand, this is why we have inductive
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.200]   Bible study because we want to make sure that all of the meaning and the imagery that is
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   given in the text is actually what we are getting out of the text, okay?
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:06.280]   First of all, the word for the passage, "strengthen the hands that are weak," is not an exact
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.280]   translation.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.120]   It's more of a transliteration so that we can have the gist of what the meaning is.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.820]   But if you look at the King James Version where they didn't care at all whether you
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:21.180]   understood it or not, they just kind of translated it exactly the way it is written in the Greek.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.680]   In the King James Translation, the meaning behind it is basically to lift up drooping
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.160]   hands, right?
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.160]   So lift up drooping hands.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.020]   So the imagery in our head is right there, okay?
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:40.740]   So imagery that's given in chapter, in verse 12 is an individual where the hands are drooped.
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.360]   And then the second part of that, "and the knees that are feeble," meaning that there's
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.740]   no strength in their knees that are shaking.
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:55.000]   So what is that, what do you think that's a picture of?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.380]   Take a guess of the context of somebody who would be drawn that way.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:09.540]   This looks like somebody who's in the middle of a marathon, maybe, maybe about halfway
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:16.860]   through, you know, and they're just fatigued and they're out of breath and they don't have
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.520]   the same kind of vigor that they had in the beginning.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.660]   And so when an individual gets to that point, what are they thinking?
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.780]   Hamburger?
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.260]   What are they thinking here?
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.540]   Quitting, exactly.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:39.620]   So this is a picture of an individual who started the race well, but at some point has
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:45.540]   lost their vigor and have no energy, is slooped down and their knees are starting to buckle.
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.620]   And in their mind, they're probably thinking that, "I don't know if I can continue on."
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.340]   That is who he's addressing.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:11:00.700]   He's addressing an individual or a group of people who just don't have the strength.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.860]   And they say, "Oh my gosh, you know, how am I going to make it?
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:09.660]   I still have another 13 miles to go and I'm exhausted now.
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.540]   Am I going to be able to persevere?"
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:18.580]   It is at this point where many people begin to change their theology.
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.780]   Maybe I'm not the problem.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.780]   Maybe they're the problem.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.180]   Maybe the reason why I feel this way and I'm exhausted is because the church has wronged
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.180]   me.
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.180]   These people have wronged me.
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.180]   Maybe I was at the wrong church.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.620]   Maybe I was at the wrong group.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:34.860]   And we have a tendency to either change our theology, change our circumstance, change
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.580]   the various things because I don't think I can go on.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:48.740]   This is the place where the thoughts of deconstruction comes in because they're ready to quit.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.700]   So instead of saying, "I couldn't finish this race," they say, "Maybe the race wasn't the
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.580]   right race to begin with.
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.580]   Maybe I was trained wrong.
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.800]   Maybe my trainers were wrong."
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.540]   It is these people that they are addressing and it is these people who are at this point
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:11.340]   that the whole book of Hebrews is written to, who have their hands drooped, their knees
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.980]   are beginning to buckle, they're out of breath, they're tired, they don't know if they can
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:20.340]   continue and the race seems like it's still so far away.
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.380]   Can I continue to do this?
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:30.300]   In the world, when you see an individual at that state, what do we do if you're good friends?
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.740]   In the world, you can do it.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:40.260]   Or maybe if you grew up in the church, you'll quote Philippians, "I can do all things."
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.820]   Put it on your shoes, on your shirt.
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.260]   Believe in yourself.
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.060]   You can do it.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.020]   Don't let the naysayers get to you.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.020]   Don't trust them.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.940]   Whoever you put your mind to, you can achieve and you get motivation speakers, you listen
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:04.540]   to tape or meditation because we need to persevere and that's the answer that the world is giving.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.860]   This is a Christian version of saying, "Hey, keep your chin up."
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.580]   But he's not simply saying, "Hey, believe in yourself."
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.400]   Just suck it up and find the strength within.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.500]   And if you just discipline harder, if you just work harder, you can continue.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.380]   That's not the point that he's been making.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:30.320]   The point that he's been making is you took your eyes off of Christ.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.260]   And that's why he says he's the author and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:39.260]   You started with Christ, but at some point in your walk with Christ, you began to just
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.580]   do things yourself and you ran out of energy.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.180]   You're fatigued.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.060]   So the answer is not to go back and try it again and do it harder this time.
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:53.020]   He says, "No, the reason why you became this to begin with is because you took your eyes
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.580]   off of Christ."
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:00.300]   That's exactly the point that Paul is trying to make in Philippians chapter 3, 3-7.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:07.920]   Where Paul says he is dealing with the Judaizers who are saying that salvation could not be
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.380]   by grace alone.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.160]   Yes, we believe in Jesus, but there's a part that we need to play.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.740]   And so you still need to be circumcised and you still need to respect the Mosaic law.
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:23.120]   And Paul is writing to them and he says, "For we are the true circumcision who worship in
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:30.460]   the Spirit of God in glory in Christ, Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh."
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.620]   I don't have confidence in my flesh.
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.620]   Let's try harder.
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.620]   Let's be disciplined even more.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.140]   You know, he says, "No, I put no confidence in it, although I myself might have confidence
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.780]   in the, even in the flesh.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.120]   If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, I far more."
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.520]   And Paul was not exaggerating.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:52.220]   You know, people may say that and not be true, but Apostle Paul, there's nobody who is going
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:57.400]   to go toe to toe with law keeping and his background than Apostle Paul.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.740]   And then he goes on and said, "Let's go.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.600]   If you think that that's the path of righteousness and you think the reason why I'm preaching
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.960]   salvation by grace alone is because somehow I failed in the law, let me tell you who I
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.960]   am."
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.960]   And that's what Paul is doing.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.960]   He's presenting.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.880]   Circumcised on the eighth day, meaning that he's a true Israelite.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:23.120]   He had the covenant symbol on him of the nation of Israel, not the tribe of Benjamin.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.920]   In the nation of Israel, they were, you know, there's a pecking order as to which tribes
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.520]   were the most prestigious.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.360]   What's the most prestigious?
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.640]   Tribe of Judah, because that was the kingly line.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.800]   But next to the tribe of Judah, the Benjamites were known for two things.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:43.760]   One, if you remember the book of Judges, the Benjamites were known as the mighty warriors.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.400]   So they were known to be valiant warriors.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.280]   And then two, they were known to be the ones who remained faithful to Judah when the kingdom
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:57.760]   split where the 10 tribes went with one group and the Judah and Benjamites were the only
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.480]   ones who stayed on the side that was right.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.080]   And so to say that he's a Benjamite right off the bat, right?
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.000]   You want to go toe to toe, what tribe are you from?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Manasseh.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.960]   Is that where you're from, Manasseh?
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.280]   You know what happened to Manasseh, right?
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.840]   Say, I'm from a tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew of Hebrew.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.120]   As to the law, a Pharisee.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.420]   Pharisees were the ones who took the law and they were OCD about the law, right?
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.960]   They took the book, they took the Sabbath and they said, "Well, we want to make sure
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.280]   that we never break the Sabbath.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.280]   So we're going to..."
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.240]   And they had all these other laws like, if you do this, if you touch this, if you walk
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.840]   this many, you know, steps and you go one step further, you broke the law.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.960]   These were the Pharisees who took the law seriously.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:52.080]   And he says, "You want to, you're accusing me that maybe I couldn't, I couldn't find
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.840]   righteousness and that's why I'm reverting to grace.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.240]   I'm a Pharisee."
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.440]   But as to zeal, are you questioning my passion?
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.240]   You questioning my desire?
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.520]   As to zeal, persecutor of the church.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.160]   You know, when he said he was a persecutor of the church, you have to remember that during
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:15.280]   that period, the Israelites didn't have authority to carry out capital punishment.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.280]   So when Stephen was being stoned and they put all their cloaks, everybody who stoned
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.720]   Stephen to put their cloak at the feet of Apostle Paul, who was Saul at that time, basically
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.760]   means that he's going to be responsible for this.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.640]   And Apostle Paul basically said, "Yeah, if I go to jail and I die for this, I'm willing."
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.520]   You're going to question my zeal?
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.320]   I was a persecutor of the church.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.600]   As to righteousness, which is in the law, found blameless.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.920]   Now that's got to be an exaggeration, right?
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:51.400]   Yeah, maybe in the eyes of God, but to other Jews, Apostle Paul, not only was he a Pharisee,
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:58.180]   he was, he was a direct disciple of Gamaliel, the top scholar of Israel.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.120]   And there's rumors that he was already a member of the Sanhedrin.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.700]   So it was assumed that he was blameless in the law.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.160]   But whatever thing were gained to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.360]   of Christ.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:19.820]   If my righteousness is based upon my being, me being zealous and my background and keeping
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:24.560]   the law perfectly and said, "You want to go toe to toe, I'll beat all of you."
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:30.440]   But the message of the cross actually makes all of that rubbish.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.360]   It's not because we simply need to work harder.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.320]   It's not simply because we need to be more disciplined.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.700]   All of these things are things that we ought to do, but the primary reason why they got
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:46.280]   to the point where they were about to quit is because they took their eyes off of Christ.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:51.600]   They thought at some point that they can do it by their own strength.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.320]   You and I all know the story where Jesus tells that you have a tax collector and a Pharisee
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:01.520]   who goes up to pray and the tax collector is praying, "Thank God I'm not like them.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.640]   I pay my tithes and I obey the law."
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.680]   And then the tax collector is beating his chest.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.120]   And he said, "I'm not worthy of you."
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.880]   And he says, "Who became righteous?
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.880]   Whose sins were justified?"
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.560]   He said, "The tax collector, because he received forgiveness."
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.000]   Now we all know that story.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.160]   So in the beginning in justification, we know that we have to be like a tax collector, beating
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.520]   our chest, recognizing our sin, asking for forgiveness and remaining humble.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:33.240]   But at some point after the justification, we come to sanctification, we become right
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.800]   back to the Pharisees.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.120]   I know I have to be justified.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.560]   To be justified, I need to be like a tax collector.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.040]   But to be sanctified, I need to be like a Pharisee.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.800]   I need to get all my ducks in order and I need to check off all the boxes.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.640]   I need to read the Bible a certain amount.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.720]   I need to have all my theology and I need to witness to so many people and I need to
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.120]   do all of these things.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:20:00.120]   And then we start to measure everybody else based upon these checkoff lists that we have.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:07.320]   And at some point we forget that we're always the tax collector before Christ.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.600]   We're always beating our chest in need of His mercy.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:17.120]   It is not by our own righteousness we are justified.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.560]   It is not simply by our own righteousness that we will be sanctified.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.520]   And it is not by our own righteousness that we will be glorified.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.560]   You know, one of my favorite passages in the New Testament, I think one of the most beautiful
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:34.540]   things that Jesus quoted is in Matthew chapter 12, verse 20.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:40.400]   As he is healing the sick, the Pharisees and the scribes are offended that Jesus is performing
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.840]   miracles on Sabbath.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.720]   And instead of forgetting, instead of seeing the miracles, like, oh my gosh, this guy,
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.800]   he heals the sick.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   He has power.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.320]   He must be the Messiah.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:59.440]   Instead of seeing the miracle and glorifying God, how can you be healing on the Sabbath?
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:05.000]   Jesus in receiving, knowing what's in their heart, he says in verse 20, a battered reed
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.360]   he will not break off and a smoldering wick he will not put out until he leads justice
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.920]   to victory.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.920]   A battered reed basically is a reed that has been broken.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.780]   It's useless.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.240]   A smoldering wick is kind of at the end of the candle.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.240]   You know, that's what you light in order for the oil to burn.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.840]   A smoldering wick is basically it's used, it's burned.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.760]   So basically he's saying it's worthless.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.760]   It's trash.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.080]   In any other, any definition, it would be trash.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.320]   We wouldn't look at a smoldering wick and say, let's salvage that.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.560]   We're going to recycle this, right?
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.480]   We're going to floss our teeth.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.920]   We're going to plant things.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.640]   There's nothing to be salvaged.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.640]   It's just trash.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.120]   And so he's using that imagery, saying that he's having compassion.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:00.160]   It's a lost sinner, really in rebellion against God.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.560]   He's worse than a smoldering wick and a broken reed.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.360]   A broken reed is not cursing God.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.040]   A smoldering wick is not in rebellion.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:17.000]   But he's saying that even if that is the case, he says, I will not put it out.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.600]   I think it's one of the most beautiful scenes, beautiful things that Jesus has ever said.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:28.040]   And it's his way of saying that I will not turn away, ever turn away a repentant sinner.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:33.880]   I will never turn away a genuinely repentant sinner.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.000]   And that's what he means when he says Hebrews chapter 12, verse 3, for consider him who
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.840]   has endured such hostility by sinners against himself, so that you will not grow weary and
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.080]   lose heart.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.080]   So let me stop right there.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.880]   Look at that text.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:54.120]   We look at that and say, he endured hostility so that we will not grow weary.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:59.520]   Does he mean that he set an example for us of persevering?
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.320]   And even though he was being attacked, he endured, so therefore he set an example.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.780]   And so we need to follow that example that in the midst of persecution that we need to
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.520]   persevere as well.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.560]   Possibly, right?
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.120]   Possibly.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:23.120]   I believe the main thrust of what he's saying here is that in the context of being weary
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:30.400]   and losing heart and arms drooping and knees buckling, he says Jesus has accomplished what
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.880]   you could not do.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.640]   He endured hostility against sinners against himself.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.640]   What does that mean?
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:46.760]   He went to the cross despite the suffering, despite the rejection, despite the pain.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:53.800]   He said he went to the cross so that when we are weary, that we do not need to quit
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.400]   because God's not placing that on our shoulder that you better get your act straight.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   You better do this.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.000]   He says no, because he knew we were going to be weak.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.840]   He knew there are times that we're going to be drooping arms.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.320]   We're going to have buckling knees.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.000]   He says he endured for us so that you would not lose heart.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.240]   In other words, to look to Christ that when those situations happen, that we do not look
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.920]   to people, we do not look to leaders, we do not look to circumstances or community or
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:34.640]   finance or politics to fix your eyes upon Christ, the beginner and the finisher of our
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.160]   faith.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.000]   Romans chapter 8, 26 to 28 says in the same way the spirit also helps our weakness.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.240]   For we do not know how to pray as we should, but the spirit himself intercedes for us with
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.600]   groanings too deep for words.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:56.920]   This passage is always so encouraging to me because even in our prayers, he says when
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.720]   you can't pray, I know I commanded you to pray.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:05.000]   I know how important prayer is, but even when you can't pray and you don't know what to
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.560]   pray for, he provided for us.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.800]   The spirit inside of us interceding and he who searches the hearts knows what the mind
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.000]   of the spirit is because he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.960]   And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God,
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.560]   to those who are called according to his purpose.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:38.800]   He even provided knowing that there are times where we're going to have a hard time praying.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.680]   We don't know what to pray for, where we're lost.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.920]   What is God's will?
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:49.160]   That even in that context, he says, I made it so that the Holy Spirit will groan with
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.400]   words that even you don't understand.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:58.280]   So that there the Holy Spirit is interceding on our behalf even when we are struggling.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.960]   He thought of everything, everything.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.200]   He didn't just justify us and then said, you better get to work.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.640]   He didn't just justify us and say, now everything, I've done everything I could, now you just
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.640]   go to it.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.800]   He said, no.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.520]   He who started a good work in you, he will carry it onto completion.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.640]   And he says, all things work together for good.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.040]   For who?
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.040]   For those who are the most disciplined, for those who have the best theology, for those
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.440]   who have proven track record.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:33.720]   And I said, for those who have been called and for those who love him.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.960]   Are you justified?
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.220]   And do you love him?
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:44.400]   So the most important question that a Christian should be continually asking is, do I love
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.120]   him?
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.140]   That's the greatest commandment.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.060]   And that's the measuring stick that God uses.
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:57.020]   And he says, if you are justified and if you love him, all things will work together for
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.820]   good according to his purpose.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.500]   He will do it.
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:07.440]   See, our struggle is we have a tendency.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:12.980]   And it's proof that maybe we haven't really truly have even died yet.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:18.580]   We have a tendency to live up to the expectations of people rather than the calling of the gospel.
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:23.820]   So, we jump through hoops and do what we need to do because that's expected of us from
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.940]   our community.
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.500]   Maybe our leaders, our friends, our family members.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.260]   You know who is under that pressure more than anybody else?
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.260]   Right here.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.380]   Me.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.500]   And then the other pastors.
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.500]   Then the elders.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.820]   The small group leaders.
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.340]   Anybody who leads is under that pressure.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.340]   You don't have to be a leader.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.340]   You just have to be a Christian.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.220]   You just have to be a member of the church.
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.220]   You know.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:56.740]   So, we live up to the expectations of what other people think we ought to be rather than
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.540]   living up to the calling that God has given us as his children.
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:06.420]   So, what ends up happening is we become experts in presenting ourselves.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.720]   The longer you've been a Christian, you know the knee-jerk answer.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.580]   How are you doing?
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.580]   Good.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:13.580]   Right?
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.940]   Struggling but getting better.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.340]   Right?
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:23.140]   And we have these generic things that deep inside is like, "Man, I'm about to die.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.460]   Man, I've been hooked on pornography for months."
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.340]   But the way we answer is like, "Struggling.
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.340]   Right?
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.340]   Just struggling."
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.940]   Because we know.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.980]   We know how to get along.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.780]   We know how to function.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:37.900]   Right?
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:44.940]   And so, when that begins to break down and we start the hypocrisy of a double life that
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:51.340]   we're living and all of a sudden either that causes us to repent and get right with God
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:55.540]   or we go through deconstruction saying that maybe it's their fault.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.380]   Maybe I'm in this situation because they were the ones who put that pressure on me and then
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.140]   I try to live up to their standard because they started judging me.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.840]   They told me I need to do this.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:11.300]   Not realizing maybe from the get go we were founded upon the wrong foundation.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.420]   You know, there's this song from Twyla Paris.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:19.100]   I don't think she is famous anymore but she was at one point and has a song called Warrior
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.500]   is a Child.
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.940]   And this song, I wanted to read it to you.
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.740]   It says, "Lately I've been winning battles left and right but even winners can get wounded
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.500]   in the fight.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.360]   People say that I'm amazing, I'm strong beyond my years but they don't see inside of me I'm
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.340]   hiding all my tears.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:41.700]   I don't know that I come, they don't know that I come running home when I fall down.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.100]   They don't know who picks me up when no one is around.
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:51.300]   I drop my sword and cry for just a while because deep inside this armor the warrior is a child.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:56.120]   Unafraid because his armor is the best but even soldiers need a quiet place to rest.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:01.040]   People say that I'm amazing, I never face retreat but they don't see the enemies that
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.240]   lay me at his feet.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.600]   They don't know that I come running home when I fall down.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.400]   They don't know who picks me up when no one is around.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:17.240]   I drop my sword and cry for just a while because deep inside this armor the warrior is a child."
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.560]   How many of you can relate to this song?
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:28.340]   We try so hard to present ourselves a certain way because we think that this is what we
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:37.520]   ought to do and so you do that for a year, two years, four years, five years and then
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:43.800]   the pressure begins to buckle because we're not standing on Christ.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:49.780]   So when he says if your arms are drooping and your knees are buckling that's what he's
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.020]   been trying to do to fix your eyes upon Christ.
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.320]   To fix it upon Christ.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:00.460]   The reason why the Hebrews were in the position they were isn't simply because they weren't
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.080]   trying hard enough.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.180]   It's because they forgot.
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.600]   They forgot what brought them to Christ to begin with.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.260]   They forgot that they were the bruised reed.
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.980]   That they were the burned wick.
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:27.060]   And it isn't until you and I recognize from beginning to the middle to the end that we
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:33.860]   will always be a burnt out wick that is desperately in need of his grace.
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:38.820]   We are always tax collectors beating our chest in need of his mercy.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.820]   And until then we don't need Christ.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.580]   We've been justified so we don't need Christ.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.260]   My ticket's in heaven already so we don't need Christ.
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.580]   I'm going to use my intellect.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.580]   I'm going to try hard.
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.580]   I'm going to be more disciplined.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.900]   I'm going to read more than other people.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:57.820]   And so since I'm justified I'm just going to be better.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:03.420]   It's probably that very reason why they started to drift back to begin with.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.860]   But here's the kicker in verse 13.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:11.460]   He says, "And make straight paths for your feet so that the limb which is lame may not
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.860]   be put out of joint but rather be healed."
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.940]   So you see this imagery of the race that he uses again.
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:22.220]   Here's that man who's running and he's about to quit and he says, "Here's the solution.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.220]   Strengthen that."
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.260]   In other words, get back up and then he says, "Here's what you need to do.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.100]   Make the straight path straight for your feet."
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.100]   So imagery-wise it makes sense.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:37.300]   If you're going to run this path you need to make sure that you're on the right path.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:41.540]   But again you have to understand that a first century Jew when you talked about a straight
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:47.140]   path there's an immediate understanding of what they were referring to.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:53.940]   Like today if I asked you what are the best streets in this area, right?
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:58.140]   What are the streets that you feel like you can take a car and just go as fast as you
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.820]   can, not that you should, right?
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:01.860]   But what are the best streets?
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:06.740]   What are the streets that they pay the most attention to, to make sure that there's no
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:12.860]   potholes, there's no quick turns, that you can get on that street and go straight and
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:17.700]   step on it and you're going to be able to be safe going on that street?
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.660]   What road is that way?
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.900]   Right?
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:21.900]   Jamboree?
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.340]   No, it's not Jamboree.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:28.300]   There's too many pedestrians there, right?
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.300]   And there's certain cities you have a pot, you know, like a, what do you call it, hole
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.300]   in the ground?
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.300]   >>Potholes.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.580]   >>Potholes, yes.
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.460]   It may not be fixed for a while, right?
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:44.100]   You just drive slow and then you just have to be careful.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.780]   But you will never see a pothole on the freeway.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:52.580]   Because if you have a pothole on the freeway people can die.
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.220]   And you won't see the freeway turning real quick.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.380]   All the best roads are on the highway.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:05.060]   And they, if any, even an object is on the highway, somebody will come, the CHP officers
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.480]   will come and they'll clear that out because it's dangerous.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.060]   So the best roads around us are always the highways.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.460]   They're the biggest roads, they're the safest, they're the flattest, and they pay the most
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:16.840]   attention to that.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.540]   You know what the best roads were in Israel?
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:26.820]   All the best roads in Israel were the roads that led to the cities of refuge.
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:31.260]   The cities of refuge, if you didn't know, were six cities that were commanded by God
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.740]   that as they entered into the promised land, and they were spread out in Israel in those
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:40.620]   six places, so that any part of Israel you couldn't look up because they were built on
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.820]   hills and you were able to visually see where they were.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.780]   And you knew that if anything happened, you needed to run there, you knew exactly which
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.060]   city to go to.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:35:00.340]   So the reason why he did that, he said that if somebody is like plowing or farming and
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:09.260]   accidentally he kills his neighbor, and so the neighbor's family member who becomes angry
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:14.220]   that their brother or sister or father was killed, even though it was accidentally, that
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:19.620]   they want to take vengeance, and so they call that individual "Avenger of Blood."
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.020]   And so when that Avenger of Blood wants to take vengeance on that individual who killed
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:27.940]   accidentally, that he would pack up his stuff and run to the city of refuge as soon as he
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:34.420]   can, and then when he gets to the gate, they would have a trial to see if it was accidental,
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.760]   if he is innocent, that he didn't deliberately murder this person.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:43.180]   And if that's found to be true, they would open the door, and the one who was fleeing,
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:48.540]   he would enter into the city, and the city was run by the priests.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.260]   And the leader of these cities were the high priest.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.340]   So under the protection of the high priest, the Avenger of Blood could not get to him,
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:58.940]   and that's where he would live out the rest of his life in order so that the Avenger of
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.740]   Blood would not get to him.
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.280]   Now think about that.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:10.580]   How often do you think this happened in Israel, that he would establish six cities?
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:11.580]   How often does that happen?
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.860]   How often does accidental killing happen in our community?
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.860]   I mean, our cities are much more dense.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.420]   I mean, it can happen, right, car accidents, but they didn't ride cars back then.
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.500]   So typically, if they killed somebody by accident, it was probably they're, you know, throwing
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:29.180]   the whole back, and then they hit somebody in the back of the head or something, or they
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:33.500]   were getting carried away with their cows, and they ran over somebody.
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.940]   How often does this happen?
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:40.780]   That he would, and it's mentioned in Deuteronomy, it's mentioned in the book of Numbers, it's
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:45.480]   mentioned in Joshua, in Exodus, it's mentioned in all these.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:53.740]   This was significant enough that he has six cities, all this money dedicated just so that
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:58.660]   they can have, if that ever happens, and my guess is it was pretty rare that that even
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.420]   happened.
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.500]   So why was this there?
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:07.820]   Why was so much attention given to these six cities of refuge?
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:14.140]   Every one of these cities was a visual reminder of the coming of Christ.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:20.800]   Next time you read the New Testament, see how often the word refuge is related to God.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.940]   How often you see the term refuge as Christ being our refuge.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:31.940]   All of this was an example, as Christ, as our high priest, protects us from the avenger
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.180]   of blood.
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:40.340]   All of this to point to that when Christ comes, that he will be our refuge.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:47.780]   And so the Bible says in the book of Deuteronomy that all the roads have to be paved well,
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:52.180]   so that if this happened, the best roads in Israel would always lead to the cities of
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.180]   refuge.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:38:01.720]   In the rabbinical tradition written by Josephus, the first century Jewish historian, he says
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:09.020]   it was well known that the best roads in Israel all led to the cities of refuge.
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:17.220]   In fact, every year it was part of their law to clear out these roads in case it got damaged,
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:21.340]   in case there were potholes, in case there were, you know, like they had a flood and
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.020]   the road was wiped out.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:27.340]   Every year they had to go revisit and make sure that these roads were clear and it was
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:28.340]   flat.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.380]   They built bridges, right?
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.700]   Even on the roads that are rarely traveled, they would build bridges to make sure that
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:37.860]   just in case if that happened, that an individual was running would have the clearest and the
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.500]   fastest path to the cities of refuge.
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.740]   And then on top of that, to make sure that the people who are on this path would not
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:50.780]   get lost, they put signposts every so often so that as they are running, they are reminded
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.540]   that they are on the right road.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:58.940]   So on these signs, it would say, "Refuge, refuge, refuge, refuge."
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:05.220]   So a first century Jew, when he reads this, "And make straight paths for your feet," the
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:12.080]   first imagery that he has is the cities of refuge that leads to Christ.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:21.380]   And it is in this backdrop that Christ comes to fulfill what he's been preparing, that
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.540]   he is our refuge, he is our strength.
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:27.700]   The refuge means when you are at the point where you are about to quit, that you don't
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:33.300]   have any strength to lift up your arms and your knees are beginning to buckle.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:42.240]   The only refuge that can truly protect us, where we can find life, is in Christ.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:47.420]   That's why in Isaiah chapter 40, verse 3 to 4, in the prophecy about the coming Christ,
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:52.780]   he says, "A voice is calling, 'Clear the way for the Lord in the wilderness.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.580]   Make smooth path in the desert a highway for our God.
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:40:00.680]   Let every valley be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low, and let the rough ground
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.380]   become a plain, and the rugged terrain a broad valley.'"
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:09.140]   This was a prophecy about the Messiah coming.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.380]   And this is exactly how John the Baptist's ministry is described in Mark chapter 2, verse
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.380]   3.
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:18.660]   It's written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you who will
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:19.660]   prepare your way.
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.740]   The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.060]   Make his path straight.'"
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:32.940]   The primary ministry of John the Baptist was to pave the road so that the access to the
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.820]   Messiah would be the fastest and the best.
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:41.540]   You know, that's the ministry of every minister.
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:47.980]   My calling in ministry is not so that I can know what the latest trend is in our culture
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:53.940]   and tap into that and find all the business ideas that we can implement in the church
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.980]   that will be the best organized and get the best money to do the best things.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:02.660]   And I remember early on in ministry just being burned out by all of that because it was just
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:03.660]   overwhelming.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:08.540]   And it dawned on me, God never called me to do that.
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.220]   That was the expectation of maybe the church.
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:15.140]   That was an expectation from the Christian culture.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.400]   But I didn't see that in Scripture.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:21.580]   He deliberately picked fishermen who knew nothing.
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:28.500]   I mean, if he wanted wise, smart people to build his first church, he picked the wrong
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.500]   people.
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:35.660]   In fact, when the Corinthians began to divide one another because they were so smart, he
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:39.000]   reminds them, "God chose you because you were dumb."
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.900]   That's my translation.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.520]   You weren't that great.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.740]   And now you're trying to be one up on another, and that's what's causing this division, all
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.740]   kinds of trouble.
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:54.580]   So as I was reading through Scripture, I was like, "Oh, I don't need to be that smart.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.040]   I don't need to be that clever.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.380]   I don't need to be that talented."
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:03.860]   The primary thing that he called me to do is to make the path straight, to make the
