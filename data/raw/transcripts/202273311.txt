[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   And you will notice on your packet that the passage has been shortened and namely it's
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.920]   because the second half of what I asked you guys to look at in preparation for this study,
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.140]   I'm going to be preaching on Sunday.
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.080]   So I have an opportunity to teach on Sunday and I just decided to teach the next section
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.760]   of the passage that we're studying.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.520]   But before we jump into the passage that we're studying, I wanted to do some review with
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.560]   all of you.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.840]   And so I've got some blanks on that first section, right?
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.620]   That last time we read, starting from verse 13, there was a therefore and a series of
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.680]   commands for us.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:52.400]   And I summarize that as this is the high calling of God, that perhaps counter-cultural, counter-intuitive,
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:00.040]   and counter to our own expectations, our God has laid forth expectations even in the midst
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.120]   of some of the most dire circumstances.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.960]   So please help me fill in some of these blanks.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:15.800]   We begin with number one, that we want to, the command was, "Hopefully in the," did you
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.760]   say future grace?
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.760]   Great.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.960]   So, future grace, and the grace that is going to be revealed, right?
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.120]   That we want to set our hope, not kind of, maybe not hopefully, maybe hopefully this
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.120]   will happen, but actually hope fully and completely, okay?
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.960]   Number two, what's the blank there?
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.720]   Sorry, one more time?
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.720]   Thank you.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.720]   Oh, sorry.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.640]   Preparing our minds and being sober, okay?
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.280]   Preparing our minds and being sober.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.560]   Then number two, sorry, the blank there is, "Be holy in all your conduct."
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.480]   Okay, be holy in all your conduct.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.960]   Overcoming, and this might be a little bit tricky here, there's two blanks, overcoming
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.840]   blank and blank.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:26.680]   Good, passions and ignorance, right?
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.920]   Overcoming your passions and ignorance.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.640]   These are the two things I said are great hurdles for us.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.320]   Where one, even in the Old Testament, this insatiable desire for more and covetousness
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.000]   has always stumbled the people of God, but what's more God laments saying, "My people
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.240]   suffer and die for lack of knowledge."
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.680]   They don't get it.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.480]   Number three, the blank there is?
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.000]   Fear.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.480]   Conduct yourselves with fear.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.880]   Conduct yourselves in every way with fear.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.320]   We talked about how when we have an accurate view of God, there's going to be this perfect
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.200]   balance where because God is God, the Heavenly Father, so merciful, we're going to run to
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.360]   Him, but because God is God, the Heavenly Father, we're not going to just simply flippantly
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.280]   take His grace for granted.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.680]   We're not going to offend that grace, but rather we're going to have this balance of
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.640]   fearing Him, and at the same time being embraced by the grace that He offers.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.880]   All of this, remember all of this, is empowered by how great a salvation we have.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.400]   The first major section in how Apostle Peter encouraged those who were suffering, those
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.600]   who were at a loss, said, "Look, look how what a precious treasure you have, and this
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.640]   is why you rejoice, and this is why you still have hope."
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.880]   And then he gives these commandments, "And therefore, the expectation for you is high,
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.040]   because you've been given so much."
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.200]   That's where we're at, and we're continuing on with the next two commandments of high
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.680]   calling of God for those who have been given so much in the grace of the Lord.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.360]   Let's take a moment to read the section.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.440]   I'll read it for us, starting from verse 22, all the way down to chapter 2, verse 3.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.560]   And he says, "Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth, for a sincere
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.120]   brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart, since you have been born
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.760]   again not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and abiding Word of God.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.960]   For all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of grass.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.160]   The grass withers and the flower falls, but the Word of the Lord remains forever.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.840]   And this Word is the good news that was preached to you.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.780]   So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander.
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.600]   Like newborn infants long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation,
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.800]   if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good."
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.760]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.400]   Our God, we continue to just ask for light as we approach your Word.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.280]   God, we ask for your Spirit to help illumine and continue to make sense of the Scriptures
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.280]   to us.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.500]   But more so than that, that you would provide conviction, that God, we would be deeply affected
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   by your truth.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.120]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.480]   Okay.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.560]   What I'd like to do is begin by taking the first section, verse 22 and 23.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.560]   And it's pretty simple.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.280]   Everything in the passage is pretty straightforward.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.280]   But there is a device that you can use to continue to retain, have a mechanism for you
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.400]   to have that truth really hit you.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.280]   And that again is by way of diagram.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.400]   So lesson one, I said I tried my best to use the PowerPoint, but it was like, fail.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.120]   So I just kind of gave up on the PowerPoint.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.200]   And I decided to handwrite something and then show it to you the way I do it, right?
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.640]   The verse simply reads, "Since you have been in obedience to the truth, purified your souls
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.240]   for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart."
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.240]   Okay?
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.200]   And I read both ESV and NASB now.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.280]   When you look at this, it begins with this clause, "Since you have an obedience to the
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.880]   truth, purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren."
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.520]   That's a long sentence, like a long phrase.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.560]   But that actually isn't the main verb of the sentence, the standalone verb that I've been
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.120]   so frequently talking about, right?
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.320]   So you don't have to do this to every single word because again, as we're working in the
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.420]   English, sometimes things are a little bit out of order.
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.760]   But what helps me is to put the main clause, the standalone clause, what's called an independent
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.240]   clause that does not depend on another clause to exist, right?
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.240]   Doing grammar now.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.680]   I put that at the very beginning to show me that that's what everything is kind of attached
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.680]   to.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.800]   So I have it there on my little diagram, the command, "Fervently love one another."
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   And honestly speaking, I can even take a moment to make a simple observation.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.600]   I have an adverb describing this command to love, and I ask a simple question.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.880]   How does Apostle Peter, how does the Word of God, how does my Father expect me to love?
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.160]   And that is fervently, right?
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.280]   So I drew a little arrow over.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.520]   And the next one is this idea of from the heart, from the heart.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.520]   So guess what?
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.240]   I can make a little mini sermon, how to love fervently from the heart.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:42.800]   And as I try to unpack that more, I can retain, this is how God expects me to love, right?
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.560]   But the passage obviously is much longer.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.240]   And again, Apostle Peter is using one of these kind of methodologies, having these long run-on
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.240]   sentences to emphasize the command.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.920]   He's using, you'll notice that with each command, he has various pieces attached to it.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.460]   By what power are you going to do this command?
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.400]   And how do I want this to be seen?
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.960]   So these are just observations you can make.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:13.660]   So if you'll notice, I take the next little phrase, "Since you have purified your souls,"
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.760]   and I just put it under, first initially not knowing where to put it.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.480]   But clearly, this idea of, "Since you have purified your souls," connects to the idea
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.480]   of love.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:29.080]   And it's a reason, you could almost rephrase it like, "Because you have been purified,
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.080]   love each other fervently."
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.760]   Right?
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.480]   So here I can just make a simple case of, "Here's a reason, here's a reason for your
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.160]   love."
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:46.560]   And then, the other phrases, the dependent clauses, start to define more so the purification
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.880]   that is true of us.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   So again, I'm not going to go over every single piece, but what I do is, I first draw
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.360]   out, or I guess write out the phrase, and then I ask the question, "What does this
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.320]   phrase modify?"
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.920]   And as I make that connection, I have to ask, "What is this relationship here?"
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.920]   Right?
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.240]   What is this relationship?
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.960]   So this is typically how I try to diagram each section of the Bible that I preach, or
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.800]   that I just try to study at home.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.640]   And honestly speaking, once I do this, I can see very clearly, or at least see the relationships
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.200]   at a glance.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:30.280]   So again, I see, "Hmm, like he's giving a command, he's giving a reason, and how
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.760]   it's supposed to look.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.800]   What's the grounds for this?"
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.580]   What's the motivation for this?
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.680]   And that's where I get, essentially, the points that I preach, or the points that I try to
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.680]   retain.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.680]   "This is why."
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.680]   Okay?
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.160]   I just wanted to show you, because I felt like in Lesson 1 and 2, I didn't do a good
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.000]   job of showing you how I diagram things.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.640]   Do you guys have any questions about that?
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.640]   No?
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.640]   Okay.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.440]   Then let's continue with some of these questions.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.040]   First here's a toss-up.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.680]   The easy one.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.240]   What does God expect, and what is His command?
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.240]   Right?
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.840]   Let's just answer that together.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.720]   He just wants us to fervently love from the heart.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.640]   Now I want us to think about that for a little bit.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.640]   Okay?
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:23.080]   In one sense, this is a command that's very difficult to do, is it not?
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.000]   Because it's one thing, let's say for example, if I was to ask you, like, "Man, there's
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.080]   this guy who's been left out of the circle, so to speak.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.240]   He's on the outskirts.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.280]   Can you go pick him up?
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.480]   Can you go and just invite him to something?
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.040]   Can you go and do a task?"
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.040]   That's one thing.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:50.000]   But it's entirely another thing to say, "Can you from the heart, sincerely and fervently,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.320]   go love this man?"
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.320]   Right?
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:59.560]   And the difference is, there are tasks by which we can perform and do as an objective,
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.560]   as a goal.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.720]   I just want to do this, and ba-lam, I loved him.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.720]   Right?
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:10.040]   But this idea of fervently, from the heart, has this idea that from the inside out, both
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.800]   inclusive of the internal and external, you're to love.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.760]   What's more, that adverb, fervently.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:25.040]   In the Greek, it is a very descriptive term, where essentially, if you take your muscle,
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.640]   you take your arm, and you stretch it out, and you start feeling that tension, that's
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.160]   what it's talking about, stretched out.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.920]   So the idea essentially is to the limit.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.400]   And fervently kind of makes sense here.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.120]   It's just like, there is a sense in which it's going to be uncomfortable loving, or
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.360]   like I guess trying your best to really care for an individual, because the expectation
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.800]   of God is you do it to the point where you almost feel like you're at your max.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:57.400]   So it's kind of an understatement for us to be like, "Yeah, these are general high callings
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   of God.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.320]   Yeah, they're actually really high callings of God."
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:09.200]   He expects not just simply external performance, but he also desires our internal heart to
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.040]   stretch itself to the love of the brothers and sisters around us.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:23.480]   Now to us, my question would be, does that strike us as impossible?
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:29.200]   Does that strike us as like, "That's too hard for us to do."
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.880]   I just kind of want to make a quick segue as an application.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:38.240]   It's like, there are those of us who sometimes when we have a certain emotion, it's one thing,
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.920]   yeah, you could ask me like, "Hey, just stay calm and don't say anything."
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.920]   Okay.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.920]   Right?
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.360]   But it's another thing to be like, "Just change your heart."
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.960]   Do any of you guys feel that way sometimes?
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.760]   Where the command to just change your heart seems almost impossible?
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.760]   Right?
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.920]   Because then someone can come back and say like, "Man, I can try my best, but seriously,
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.240]   if my heart's not in it, how do I do that?"
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.400]   Now before we say to ourselves, "That's impossible."
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.400]   Right?
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.360]   Let's make the first observation, but the scripture is commanding us here.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.200]   Not simply to go serve a plate.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.000]   The scripture is commanding us here to have a certain heart.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.700]   Right?
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.880]   So this is a challenge to our expectations.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.920]   This is a challenge to maybe what we're accustomed to.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:35.280]   That even if we feel like it's impossible, this is yet an expectation found in scripture.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.680]   Now let's move on and we're going to continue to get the idea more so of what God is expecting
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   of us.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:49.120]   I want us to take a moment to discuss in our group, the two questions are, why does God
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.360]   expect us to love?
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:58.640]   And if you would, just take time together to fill in what do you find as reasons that
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.620]   this passage gives in verse 22 and 23.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:09.600]   And then I asked you guys as a homework assignment last time, can you explain how being born
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:15.200]   again from an imperishable seed implies the command for you to love?
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.180]   So it's kind of like, he's making the case like, "You've been born of this imperishable
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.320]   seed, now love."
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.600]   How does that connect?
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.600]   Okay?
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.000]   So please take just a couple minutes to talk about that.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Okay.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.760]   I hope you guys had enough time there.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.760]   Good.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:38.960]   Well, let's walk down together to answer or fill in some of these blanks first.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.480]   So these are just, again, observation exercise, taking time to observe what are some of the
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.480]   reasons.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.680]   Verse 22a, what did you find as a reason to love there?
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.440]   Thank you.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.080]   Okay.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.840]   Purified.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:05.760]   So again, sometimes observations, I know it's like so obvious and it's meant to be.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.880]   When you first do your observation, before you start interpreting, it's good to just
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.060]   list off what do you see?
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.520]   So don't be afraid to just say it because I know I'm asking for the obvious.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.520]   Okay?
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:23.240]   So, but being purified, essentially he says, "You have been purified."
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.800]   What's the passage here?
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.600]   Okay.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:36.520]   In saying, "In obedience to the truth purified your souls."
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.520]   Right?
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.280]   That that in of itself is a motivation to love.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.720]   So the whole idea is by the cleansing of your heart, right?
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:51.160]   By the divine work of sanctifying you, this is a grounds for you to have the ability to
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.160]   love.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.160]   Okay?
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.400]   Verse 22b, this might have been a little bit more tricky.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.320]   What did you find there as a reason to love?
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.760]   Okay.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.240]   So good.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.000]   I'm going to put together this idea of obedience to truth.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.600]   You could actually like kind of dissect it more, so to speak.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.800]   So the whole idea is if you're conforming to the truth, then you should be loving.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   Right?
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:26.360]   And then I had another one, which is the whole idea of when he says in that passage, "For
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.760]   a sincere love of the brethren."
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.760]   Whenever I see the word "for," I'm actually thinking like this is a purpose.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.320]   This is an end or a goal or a result or whatever the relationship there might be in context.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:43.120]   And I'm sitting here thinking, okay, so first we had this is your grounds, you've been purified.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:48.000]   And then the other thing is because you've obeyed, so in consistency with the truth and
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.680]   then in consistency with God's purpose.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:17:01.600]   And then lastly in verse 23, we have, because you've been born again.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.760]   Right?
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:10.460]   This is to say that your love will be consistent with rebirth.
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.440]   Your love will be consistent with your new life.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.080]   Right?
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.720]   Your love would be consistent in your new life, new life with Christ.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.680]   So there I could have, we could have actually sat and just kind of dissected it even more,
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.080]   but we have some clear ones.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.440]   I know we had three blanks, but I just listed four.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:33.640]   But we have several different reasons and cases by which we're supposed to love because
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.320]   of these foundational things.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.760]   Because of what's spiritually true, what God has done for us, because what's spiritually
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.560]   true with the truth, because what's spiritually true in our faith, because the spiritual is
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.280]   true by the rebirth, our new life.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:54.660]   Now in asking the question, okay, so how do all these connect though, especially this
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:18:00.880]   idea of the fact that you've been reborn, not by a perishable seed, but by an imperishable
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.080]   seed.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.960]   How does this connect with the other?
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.920]   How does this motivate and move you to say, yes, that's right, because of his imperishable
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.480]   seed I should love.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.080]   How does that empower you?
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.200]   Let's make sense of that.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.480]   Well I'm going to kind of walk with us with several steps of thinking about this.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.480]   Okay?
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:31.480]   So I just finished saying, look, you've been born again, not by perishable, but imperishable
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.240]   through a living and enduring word of God.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.180]   And then if you look just down, you'll see that he starts quoting the Old Testament passage.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.640]   And that passage comes from Isaiah 40 verse eight.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.720]   Let's all take our Bibles and turn there.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.480]   Okay?
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:19:01.520]   So, in asking the question, how does that truth motivate us to love?
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:06.520]   We have to look at how does he use his proof, his evidence for it.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.560]   And here, this is the passage I want to start reading from.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.680]   Let's just start reading from verse six and I'm going to work towards verse nine.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.440]   He says, a voice says, cry.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.680]   And I said, what shall I cry?
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.640]   All flesh is grass and all its beauty is like the flower of the field.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.400]   The grass withers, the flower fades when the breath of the Lord blows on it.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.840]   Surely the people are grass.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.280]   The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.640]   This is where it comes from.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:44.040]   And then verse nine, go up to the high mountain, O Zion, herald of good news.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.560]   Lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.360]   Herald of good news, lift it up.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.920]   Fear not, says the cities of Judah.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.040]   Behold your God.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:03.680]   So in context, what he's highlighting is the power of the word.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:09.540]   The power of the word, perhaps we underestimate, perhaps we don't appreciate as much, but this
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:15.760]   incredibly powerful word that never fades, that never perishes, but it is imperishable,
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:23.200]   immortal, so to speak, is that which has given you new life.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:28.400]   So he's going back to the same theme and concept that I asked you guys the question of, do
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.560]   you see this kind of theme?
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.440]   There's this running theme, look at what you have, look at what you've been given.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.080]   And once you realize the power in which what you've been given, it should motivate you
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.200]   so that now when you say, oh, I don't know if I can love, he's saying, yes, you can.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.200]   Why?
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.240]   Because it's given you so much.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.360]   Think about the power that is contained in the word.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.880]   You think about, maybe it doesn't connect for us, but you think about what's really
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.440]   powerful.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:01.200]   Every time you see one of those cheesy movies, whether it's like Wolverine, Kung Fu Panda,
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.040]   the villain, what are they always pursuing?
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.800]   What are they pursuing?
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.800]   Immortality.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.920]   You know, like they don't want to die.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.480]   Well, the fact of the matter is saying, look at the word.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.200]   Everything, all flesh, everything created, the field that's beautiful, the hills, the
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.600]   mountains, the armies, they all perish.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.440]   But the word of God stands forever.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.160]   It never goes and comes back void.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.160]   It's powerful.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.080]   It will last.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.640]   And through that imperishable word, it's given you life.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.560]   And when it calls it a seed, it's saying, this is the source.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.560]   This is the source by which you have life.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.520]   And how do we all make sense of that then?
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.320]   For us, God is expecting us not to be a people of like, man, these people are being mean
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.600]   and these people are so stubborn and it's frustrating and it's so hard, but I'm going
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.000]   to try.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.520]   He expects us to be people who have so much love to give.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.800]   Because we've been given so much power, so much grace, so much in terms of the wealth
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.440]   of the source of life.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.440]   That's what he's saying.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.560]   That he wants you to be those individuals where you're not looking at the person saying,
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.560]   that's impossible.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.840]   See, it depends on your perspective.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.520]   All day today I've been thinking about fences and I watched a YouTube video about how to
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.520]   build a fence.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.340]   It was so funny because this guy was like, lay down your one post at one end and lay
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.240]   down your other post at the other end.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.240]   And then you eyeball it to see if it's straight.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.240]   And I'm just like, are you serious?
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.600]   You know, if I close this eye and then if I open that eye, all of a sudden it's not
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.600]   straight.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.040]   Have you ever done that where you're like looking at something and if you, depending
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.000]   on which eye you look at, it's not straight.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.800]   It's so funny.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.280]   Well, the fact of the matter is when we have a hard time to love, we're looking with the
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.280]   wrong eye.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.880]   We're looking at the person and say, I don't know if I can love you.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.880]   God expects us to look at what we have and say, I have so much love to give.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.760]   I'm not even looking at you.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.760]   Right?
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.760]   That's how we do it.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.880]   And I see it's so interesting.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.960]   You know, I don't know why every time I was thinking about this, I thought about like
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.280]   the previous older Korean generation.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.000]   It's sad, but they have a lot of marital strife.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.200]   The people they're supposed to be in so love with covenant relationship.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.960]   They have a lot of marital strife, but without fail, a lot of Korean parents will die for
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.200]   their kids, will pay for whatever the kids need.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.320]   They'll sacrifice their old, they'll work years without ever taking a rest and they'll
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.400]   just love on their kids to the point where it's not even healthy anymore.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.400]   Right?
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.400]   So it's like spoiling the kids.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.640]   I'm just saying like, why is that?
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.440]   Why is the discrepancy?
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.320]   You've got so much love to give.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.720]   Why can't that happen here?
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.200]   They're just looking with the wrong eye.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.120]   They're looking expectantly at the other person thinking like, why have you done for me?
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.520]   Look at what you're expecting me to do.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.160]   And they're looking at the kid like, I've got so much to give you.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.840]   Right?
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:06.320]   So when we say, I don't know if I can love that person, maybe it's not even just looking
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.320]   at the wrong eye.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.700]   Maybe it's just truthfully, we're not willing.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:14.740]   If we are Christians, we have such a power.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.240]   We should have a wealth of love to give.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.160]   That's how the scriptures describe us to the point that in first John, the scriptures say,
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.920]   apostle John says, if you say, you know God, but you cannot love your brother.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   The two are so intertwined.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.840]   I'm going to say you a liar.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.400]   You probably don't know God because God is love.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.440]   And if you say you know him to a degree where you have the wealth of his grace and you have
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.160]   the wealth of his love, then you have so much love to give.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.280]   How can you say you can't love him?
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.560]   So this is challenging for us.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:54.520]   It's the high calling of God that although it feels like we can't, we have to remember
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.520]   the grace we've been given.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.880]   And we have to challenge ourselves, man, if I really know the power of the word and seed
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:07.520]   given to me, the truth of the gospel given to me, then I have now a wealth, well of love
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.520]   to dig into and love the people around us.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.520]   Amen.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.520]   Okay.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:20.720]   So then that's the first command that we're looking at today of the series of commands
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.360]   that we should love one another fervently from the heart.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:32.960]   The next segment we have, we can just summarize it by calling it long for the word.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.960]   Okay.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.960]   Excuse me.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.360]   The commandment is there.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.560]   Let's take a moment to read that together or I'll just read it for us.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.200]   This is verse one through three of chapter two.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.720]   And he says, therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:58.400]   and all slander like newborn babies long for the pure milk of the word so that by it you
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:04.560]   may grow in respect to salvation if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.800]   Okay.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.360]   So we have multiple things happening here.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:15.320]   Again, if you were to ask what is the main independent command, it's to long for the
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.320]   word.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:23.680]   But prefacing that command, he has this idea of constantly be putting aside all and he
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.520]   gives us a list.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.520]   Right.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:31.960]   So let's talk really quickly about what do you think it means to be putting aside something?
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.960]   Okay.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.960]   Putting aside something.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.040]   I love the way that NIV puts it.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.040]   He's like, rid yourself of this.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.040]   Okay.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.520]   Because that kind of emphatically captures the sense of the word.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.240]   The word really talks about like when you have a filthy garment that you just take it
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.240]   off.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:54.440]   You know, for example, if you guys, you know, sometimes like there's this like insect or
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.200]   spider and like, you know, just take it off.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.920]   You know, in the long time ago when they had baptism ceremonies to even kind of symbolically
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.680]   the gesture, they would have people wear dark robe and then before they get baptized, they
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.680]   take it off.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.400]   And then when they come out, they give you like a white robe that the church gives you.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.400]   It's really symbolic.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.640]   You know, our church just gives you a cool BCC shirt, you know.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.200]   But back then they made it like a drama so you can see like I'm putting off the old,
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.200]   putting on the new.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.880]   And that's the whole idea.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:30.160]   Now I just want us to think about that for a moment because here's this idea for us.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.240]   He's saying before I even tell you to long and receive the word, we have to do a put
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.240]   off, put on.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.240]   Right.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.200]   Put off, put on.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.040]   So here's this question, you know.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:49.040]   Do we put off of the things that are contrary, especially to what we just talked about, things
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.560]   that are contrary to love?
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.880]   You know, I remember when I was in college, I had a wildly germaphobe roommate.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.760]   Have you guys ever lived with one of those?
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.080]   Wildly germaphobe.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:05.360]   So he'd be one of those guys who use chopsticks to eat snacks so that his fingers, dirty fingers
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.800]   don't touch the keyboard and stuff.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.880]   I'm like, wow, that's another level, you know?
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.160]   And then if you want to go over and talk with him and then you go sit down, he's like, what
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.160]   are you doing?
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.160]   I'm like, I'm sitting down.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.160]   But it's because I'm in my regular clothes.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.960]   He's like, you sit on public places.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.200]   You go, you know, sit, sit at the school and all this kind of stuff.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.400]   And one time I made the mistake of putting my backpack on his bed.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.840]   Oh, he just like, do you know me?
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.880]   I know you put your backpack on the floor, you put your backpack here.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.560]   He's like, calm down, man.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.040]   Never talking to you again.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.480]   But the whole idea is, I mean, even though that's an extreme, but I'm bringing that up
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.800]   because he would demand, put that somewhere else.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.380]   You better change or whatever it may be.
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:55.440]   But sometimes we do stuff like that where, I know some of you guys do this, you guys
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.720]   play basketball, you go out to dinner with your friends, you come home, you're all tired,
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.720]   so you're like, forget it, I'm going to bed.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.720]   Right?
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.720]   I've done it.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.480]   I know you've done it because you're shaking your head.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.360]   Sometimes you do that when you get all like lazy or whatever.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.360]   So gross.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:19.920]   But then can you imagine it's not just playing basketball and you're all still sweaty.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.320]   But if you're working out in the field, you got mud on you, you're working with chemicals
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.880]   or something, you had to church clean day or whatever, you're like cleaning the bathroom,
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.400]   you just go home and you just jump in your bed.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   Would you do that?
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.400]   No.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.560]   Sometimes analogies don't work.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.560]   You guys do this stuff and I say you shouldn't.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.560]   All right.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.440]   But it just rationally makes sense.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:50.360]   There are things that we have to take off in order for us to really take upon what God
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.160]   is desiring for us.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.440]   And here again, I want to make a mention, as I sat there observing and as I sat there
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:03.080]   thinking about it, he's talking about things where again, it's not simply external behavior
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.080]   modification.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.960]   Just give it a try, man.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.960]   Just say the nice thing.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.800]   I mean, you can because externals matter too.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:19.160]   But here he's talking about internal ideas when he starts listing the stuff that we're
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:26.160]   supposed to take off about malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.600]   I want to ask you this question.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:35.480]   As we take a look at this, do you see any commonalities or maybe patterns or like same
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.880]   category when we talk about malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander?
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.640]   Well, let's first do this.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:48.080]   Let's first take this laundry list and let's go down and describe each one of these.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:54.440]   And as I do it, I'll commend every single one of us to take a moment to do one of those
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.960]   laundry list evaluation of my heart.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.880]   Do I struggle with this?
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.040]   Okay.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.040]   So let's begin with malice.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.040]   Let's begin with malice.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.920]   Well, the English dictionary, I just looked it up on the online.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.600]   It just means a desire to harm somebody.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.800]   Right?
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.480]   The Greek term is really general.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.480]   The Greek term, like it's used many, many times in the New Testament and it refers to
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:24.240]   like just general wickedness and general like, you know, treachery and evil.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.640]   But the English dictionary says when you have a desire to inflict harm on an individual,
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.040]   then you say someone has malice.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.040]   Right?
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.160]   And when someone like, you know, playing basketball and then they throw elbows, whatever, like
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.160]   dang man.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.000]   And they're like, yeah, I didn't mean it.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   That's one thing.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.280]   But then when you say like, dude, that was malicious, right?
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.800]   You had the intent to harm somebody.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:52.200]   And then, so there's this hard condition where maybe because of a vengefulness, maybe because
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:58.040]   of a kind of grievance where we want to get back at somebody, it's a very, very wicked
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   thing.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   And we have to catch ourselves when perhaps we would delight in the harm of another person.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.640]   Right?
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.080]   And sometimes we do that.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.040]   We have little ways where we do that and we have big ways we do that.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.640]   We have big ways where we just lash out, we vent, and then we just rip somebody apart.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.040]   Or we have like cold shoulder days where we're like, I'm just going to make you feel cold
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.040]   and then you just turn it.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.880]   You have lots of different ways where we want to inflict harm.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.960]   That's malicious.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.840]   Next is their deceit.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:35.320]   Is there deceit where there's this manipulation, dishonesty.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.240]   The Greek term is very vivid.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.520]   It means to bait somebody.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:43.440]   It actually means to like have a bait on a hook and be like, come on.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.960]   Right?
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:51.320]   But this again, I mean, although yes, it is an action of lying, deceit, but we realize
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:57.840]   that the heart that is deceitful has this selfishness that is desiring to manipulate
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.680]   the truth in order to get what we want.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.920]   That's why we lie.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.440]   Is it not?
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.640]   Next there's a heart condition of envy.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.640]   Envy.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.800]   What we like to call the green monster.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   Right?
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:18.480]   When you look at somebody else's prosperity and then the immediate response is, what about
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.480]   me?
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.360]   You look at someone's prosperity and maybe it's not, what about me?
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.160]   It's like, I can't stand to see that person do well.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.160]   Right?
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.720]   Where it's a resentment of another individual's well being.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.040]   And this often leads to a sense of bitterness.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:39.880]   This often leads to a sense of resentment and a competitive spirit.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.880]   Now there's a healthy kind of competitive where you're just trying to do your best.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.880]   Right?
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.080]   And the people around you are spurring you on.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.320]   And then there's another kind of competitive where you're just like, I don't care if I
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.960]   step on your toe or your face, I'm getting above you.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   Right?
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.160]   That's a kind of competitive spirit.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.640]   It's a competitive spirit that's in our hearts.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.000]   And then next, slander.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.160]   Slander.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.720]   Whether it be whispers of gossip, whether it be tattletales of like, oh, did you hear
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.720]   that?
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.720]   He did this.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.720]   You know?
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.760]   Whether it be a desire to defame somebody.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.200]   And then we know, scripture says in James, that our mouths, when we speak ill of people,
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.720]   it can cause more harm.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.040]   It can cause more harm than physical attacks.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.040]   Right?
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.960]   I mean, truthfully speaking, how many people at church have been physically attacked by
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.960]   another brother or sister?
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.440]   And how many of you have been hurt because of things people said?
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:42.280]   These are the things that Apostle Peter, interestingly enough, pulled together and said, I want you
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:49.200]   to put your hope, I want you to sober your mind, I want you to be holy, I want you to,
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.720]   you know, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.360]   And he says, I want you to put this away.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.300]   All this kind of stuff.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.920]   So we go back to this question of like, but I wonder why he kind of lumped these together.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:06.640]   And to tell it truthfully, there isn't no like, one explicit answer to that.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.720]   But can you guys share a little bit of what you guys said?
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.000]   What you guys talked about in your group?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.720]   Or did I ask you guys to talk about this?
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.720]   Aw man.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.440]   I'm not supposed to ask you to talk about it.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.440]   Okay.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.600]   Well does anybody want to just take a shot at it?
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.120]   Because again, there isn't like a specific right answer that the Bible is so explicit
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.120]   on on this.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.080]   But I just, I thought it was helpful to ask, like, why?
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.400]   You know, why limit these?
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.600]   Or not why list these kind of sins we need to put away?
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   Or is there any commonality?
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.600]   Yes.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.600]   Well, the commonality is that they're inflicting harm or retribution on someone.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   That would be something that would be very tempting for them because of how unjustly
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.600]   they were persecuted by people around them or near them or their followers.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.600]   And so I think that's a good question.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.600]   I think that's a good question.

[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.600]   I think that's a good question.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   I think that's a good question.
