[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.080]   All right, if you would turn your Bibles over to the book of Galatians chapter 5.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.080]   Book of Galatians chapter 5.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.800]   Pastor Peter has been going through the series in the book of Romans and there has been a
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.520]   lot of talk of salvation by grace and grace alone through faith, right?
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.480]   That salvation is truly of God and it's something that we take part in only through faith.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.960]   And the book of Galatians is in many ways on the same vein, teaching the same thing.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.600]   But we're dropping into chapter 5 because a connected theme to that idea of salvation
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.360]   by grace is a message of freedom, okay?
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.780]   And I'm going to read to us starting from verse 1 down to verse 6 and then we'll take
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.640]   some time to pray.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.460]   And it says in chapter 5 verse 1, "It was for freedom that Christ set us free.
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.340]   Therefore, keep standing firm and do not be subject again to the yoke of slavery.
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.780]   Behold, I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will have no benefit
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.780]   to you.
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.720]   And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is under obligation to
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.100]   keep the whole law.
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.520]   You have been severed from Christ and you who are seeking to be justified by the law,
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.540]   you have fallen from grace.
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.500]   For we through the spirit by faith, we are waiting for the hope of righteousness.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.660]   For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything but faith
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.300]   working through love."
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.780]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.740]   All right, God, we want to thank you for your precious word and we really ask, God, that
[00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.340]   you bless us in this time with truth, with wisdom, with understanding.
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.940]   But also, God, we pray that as we're talking about a vital concept in the scripture about
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.420]   the freedom you give to us, the gift that you afford to us, I pray, Lord, that we would
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.020]   both understand and experience it.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.900]   And I ask, God, that ultimately we will continue to receive and to experience the blessings
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.900]   you have for us.
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.900]   Father, we thank you.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.900]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.540]   Amen.
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.220]   Okay.
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:27.580]   Well, part of the reason I decided to speak on this topic was because I realized as I
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.780]   was going through the book of Galatians, whereas before I saw it as simply like a rebuke against
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.300]   anybody who tried to be legalistic, I actually realized the concept of freedom is actually
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.000]   the major concept in the book of Galatians.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.820]   It's actually like encompasses the whole letter, where if you were to read it from front to
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.620]   end, that would be the message you would get.
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.220]   Not so much a, "Hey, let's not be legalistic, but let's be free."
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.460]   And I felt that it was very appropriate.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.460]   Why?
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.820]   Because 4th of July is just a week away.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.800]   And as I think about what 4th of July means for us, actually that day is for many Americans
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.220]   like day of remembering we're free.
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.260]   Now some of us, that's a very near and dear concept.
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.580]   And we value our freedom.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:27.100]   We're really well aware that freedom is not a common experience for all of mankind, even
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.100]   in this day.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.820]   But rather it is something to be cherished.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.480]   It is something of a great privilege.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.340]   But on the other end, truthfully speaking, I mean, it's been a really long time since
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.760]   we fought against the oppression of England as a nation.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.500]   And what's more, even when we talk about freedom in this day and age, a lot of Americans, I
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.940]   feel, perhaps don't really get what freedom really means.
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.620]   And actually, every time I think of 4th of July, I don't know why, I think of this one
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.180]   song, "God Bless the USA."
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.940]   Do you guys know the lyrics to that?
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.660]   Well, if you don't, here it is.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.060]   It says, "If tomorrow all things were gone," I'm not going to sing it, I'm just going to
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.060]   say it again.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.520]   "If tomorrow all things were gone, that I worked for all my life, and I had to start
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.460]   again with just my children and my wife, I thank my lucky stars to be living here today."
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.180]   Because the flag still stands for freedom, and they can't take that away.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.140]   I'm proud to be an American, for at least I know I'm free.
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.060]   I won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me, and I'd gladly stand up next
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.140]   to you and defend her till today, because there ain't no doubt I love this land.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.140]   God bless the USA.
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.380]   I'm going to be honest, I really feel like that song is really cheesy.
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.140]   Every time I hear it at a baseball game or some big event and I hear it sing, it sounds
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.500]   a little hokey, and it's like, "At least I know I'm free."
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:56.460]   But at the same time, my point in bringing that up is the concept of freedom is actually
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.900]   to be cherished.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.780]   And even in a political, government, and national sense, that freedom is highly valuable.
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.920]   As a matter of fact, in most recent years, and right now in current events, that kind
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.740]   of freedom is sought after with life.
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:23.180]   We hear of people, refugees, people who are escaping and fleeing on boats, risking everything,
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.460]   just to have a taste of freedom in a distant land.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.460]   This is amazing.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.300]   And so, there's a sense to which we actually should look into this concept, because for
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:41.080]   us as Christians, not just in nationality, not just when it comes to government or politics,
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.340]   but spiritually, that's one of the major concepts by which the Bible describes the gospel and
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.160]   the salvation that we receive.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.880]   We are people freed.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.200]   We have a freedom in God.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.020]   I just want to give a warning that as I'm going to go through this sermon, typically
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.480]   my go-to is I have like four points or five points that are numbered and you guys can
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.480]   follow and take notes.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.040]   Unfortunately, today, it's just going to go verse by verse to verse.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.360]   So, I'll just tell you the section as we go, and this will help you take notes that way.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.200]   Let's take a look at verse one.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.480]   And it says, "For freedom, Christ has set us free.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.400]   Stands firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery."
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.400]   Okay?
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:34.280]   That first verse, as I looked at it and I took some time to meditate on it, I realized
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.360]   just the point that I'm making, the concept of freedom is much more relevant and vital
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.960]   to our Christian theology than I first presumed.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.760]   That it says, "Christ in his work to set us free."
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.760]   Why did he do it?
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.040]   "Is to actually set you free."
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.840]   Meaning this tells us that freedom as a gift that God is giving to us is vitally important
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.240]   in God's eyes.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.280]   It's vitally important in God's program.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.600]   It's the gift to which God has labored to give to us.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:11.200]   It's the valuable thing to which God has been working for, is to make us free.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   And there's all these questions I started to think about.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.140]   I started to ask myself the questions, if it's that valuable, if that's the purpose
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.960]   to which why he's been laboring, if that is grand in the scheme of God's redemption,
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.680]   A, do I know what it is?
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.880]   B, do I experience it?
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.800]   Do I experientially know, am I aware of what that entails?
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   Right?
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.080]   And do I know what it's all about?
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.240]   And do I know why it's so important?
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.520]   But I'm going to be honest on an experiential level.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:52.640]   I guess day to day as a Christian just walking, more so than anything, I actually feel a frustration.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.360]   Because there are days when I'm frustrated with my own battle.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.440]   I mean the fact of the matter is, if I look at current circumstances, it doesn't feel
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.680]   like I'm necessarily like, "Yay, freedom!"
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.840]   It actually feels like, "Yeah, we're fighting and we hope to get there sometime."
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.120]   And that's partially the reason why I read the passage that I read this morning in the
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:18.540]   book of Romans, because it says that all of creation, and we included, we want freedom.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.040]   And that is God's promise to us.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.360]   And that's what is held before us.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.960]   But experientially, do we know what all of that means?
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:35.360]   Well let's take a look at verse two and four, as he talks about the kind of freedom that
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.760]   he wants us to experience, or that he's addressing here.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:45.640]   In verse two to four he says, "Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision,
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.560]   Christ will be of no benefit to you.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.280]   And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is under obligation to
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.560]   keep the whole law.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:02.080]   You have been severed from Christ, and you who are seeking to be justified by law, you
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.720]   have fallen from grace."
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.920]   Now there are a lot of important things to draw from that section.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:15.080]   You see, my experiential frustration, that is the frustration when Jesus described in
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:20.440]   John chapter eight, he said, "He who sins is a slave to sin."
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:26.640]   So typically my experience of the lack of freedom is the frustration with sin.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.300]   And so I'm frustrated, like I wish I could be free from the sin of arrogance, where sometimes
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.880]   I see in hindsight what I said, and how I thought, and I'm like, "Ugh."
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.240]   And I have to go back and repent, you know, "I'm really sorry for thinking and saying
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.240]   that to you."
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.240]   So whatever it may be, like various sins of desiring stuff, and sensuality, or whatever
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.000]   the sins may be, those are typically what we think of slavery, you know?
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.520]   The yoke of bondage of sin.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.520]   And that's absolutely true.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.520]   The freedom that God has for us is a freedom from the bondage of sin.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.560]   But here and now, he hones in on the kind of freedom that he's actually dealing with
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.120]   in the book of Galatians.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.320]   And you all well know what it is.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.880]   It is a system of law.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.880]   It is legalism.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.600]   It is legalism as a system to which they have looked to as a means to deal with sin, so
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   it's all connected.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.200]   Does that make sense?
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.560]   There was a problem, the sin.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.460]   I feel bound to it.
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:38.080]   And then there was this system of law, ceremony, ritual, penalty, reward, whatever it may be,
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.240]   that was attached as a solution to that problem.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.920]   And that in of itself, again, was another form of slavery.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.960]   That's essentially what he's saying.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:53.280]   Because if you look at the details of this, he says very clearly that once you do an act
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:59.600]   of circumcision, you are now obligated to observe the whole thing.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.840]   And I'm going to use the analogy of coming into a nation a lot.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.480]   I'm going to use that analogy now.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.360]   You can't go to a nation and be like, "I'd really love to join your nation.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.680]   I'm an immigrant here, but I only like your articles one through three.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.840]   The rest of them is pretty garbage."
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.840]   You don't say that.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.080]   If you want to come in, you abide by all of it, right?
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.920]   Likewise, Apostle Paul is saying that circumcision is one act, but it's representative of the
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.320]   whole system.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.520]   Once you're in it, it's going to be a taskmaster over you, and now you are what?
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.520]   Obligated.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.280]   You're going to be bound.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.560]   There's going to be restriction requirement, and there's going to be such a penalty to
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.280]   which if you do not abide by all the stipulations of the law, you will die.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.560]   That's what it said.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.680]   And that there is a problem.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.920]   That there is a slavery.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.380]   That there is a bondage.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.840]   And so Apostle Paul starts to describe this slavery that's going to now then ruin you.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.880]   You think by doing that circumcision and buying into the law, you think it's helping you.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.340]   It's helping you get right with God.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.560]   It's helping you deal with the problem of sin.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.760]   It's helping you, but it's not.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.920]   As a matter of fact, it's going to ruin you.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:15.400]   Verse four, you're going to be severed from Christ, and as you seek to be justified by
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.000]   the law, you're going to fall from grace.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Whoa.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Now it's getting a bit serious.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.320]   Remember Apostle Paul is talking to Christians.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.480]   People who have already at least said they're Christians.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.400]   People who have at least proclaimed the name of Christ, and they're in the context of the
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.480]   church.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.360]   And in the context of the church, there are these false teachers who come around and start
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.360]   saying stuff.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.360]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.360]   And then Apostle Paul gets incredibly mad at them.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.800]   Check out how mad he gets.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.360]   Take a look at verse seven through 12.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.920]   You were running well.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.200]   Who hindered you from obeying the truth?
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.160]   This persuasion did not come from him who calls you.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.720]   This is not of God.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.040]   They're calling you in and persuading you.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.440]   And he says, "Little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.600]   I have confidence in you and the Lord that you will adopt no other view, but the one
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.920]   who is disturbing you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.160]   But I, brethren, if I preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted?
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.200]   Then the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.320]   I wish that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves."
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.320]   Wow.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.920]   I'm not sure if you get the wow, but you see what he's saying?
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.560]   That the people who are persuading you and the false teachers, he says, "I wish they
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.580]   would mutilate themselves."
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.580]   You know what?
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.580]   That's not even the worst of it.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.720]   Because if you go to chapter one, I think you guys have heard this passage before, verses
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   eight and nine.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.080]   Okay, chapter one, verses eight and nine.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:58.120]   That even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.540]   what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.500]   As we have said before, so I say it again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.780]   contrary to what you receive, he is to be accursed.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.340]   The term anathema.
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.000]   They should essentially be damned.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.080]   They should be judged, cast out.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.080]   Wow.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:28.600]   And so we got to ask the question, why is the Apostle Paul so upset?
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.640]   Why is he so riled and enraged that these people would come across and say, "Hey, I
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.800]   know you're in a church, I know you're a Christian and stuff, but you got to get circumcised
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.280]   in order to be right with God."
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.280]   Why?
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.280]   Okay.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.480]   And we're going to deal with that a little bit.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:48.000]   Well, first and foremost, as we look at this passage, very clearly we know that by law
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.040]   no man is going to be justified.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.920]   It is completely futile.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.920]   It doesn't work.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.340]   Right?
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.720]   What I'm saying is this, and this is really important.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.720]   Okay.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.680]   Earlier, I'm talking about a concept of bondage.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:12.200]   Whenever you have a problem, but you have no solution, you feel like you're in bondage.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.200]   Right?
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:19.080]   Well, the fact of the matter is the old covenant, the old saints, the Jewish people, they look
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.240]   to the law like a solution.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.240]   How are we going to deal with our sin?
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.240]   The laws of atonement.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.520]   Let's sacrifice the animal.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.320]   Let's put our hands on the animal, send him out, let's shed the blood, let's do all this
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.440]   stuff, because those were the stipulations that were sent.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.640]   How are we going to restrain our sin?
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.740]   Let's abide by the law, put on stuff like that.
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.540]   And so now that's how the Pharisees conducted everything.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.480]   When they would minister to the people in their synagogue, the way that they would minister
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.680]   to prevent sin, to deal with sin, their solution was law, legalism.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.240]   Don't walk, don't carry, don't do this, don't eat, don't touch.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.720]   But we know that does not work.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.120]   It just gets you mad.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:05.240]   And we know from scriptures, it teaches us the law was never meant to be the solve-all,
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:12.920]   the solution for that sin, but rather that law exposes to you that's how sinful you are.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.400]   And so here is a law that was purposed to distinguish you as a nation and then to show
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.800]   you that you need a greater sacrifice.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.640]   And here you are saying, but we keep going to this law, save us, do something, prevent
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.900]   our sin.
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.700]   It doesn't work.
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.080]   It leaves you only wanting more.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.040]   And so I say, you know, I'm not against rules and discipline.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.080]   As a matter of fact, especially if you're young, especially for kids, rules are necessary,
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.000]   discipline is necessary.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Is law good?
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Yes.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.520]   Is it a solution to your sin?
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.520]   No.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.760]   Right?
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:56.320]   As a matter of fact, if you listen to this, it says, do not handle, do not taste, do not
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:02.200]   touch these rules, which have to do with things that are all destined to perish with us are
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.120]   based merely on human commands and teachings.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.640]   Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom with their self-imposed worship,
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.480]   their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.800]   But they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.920]   That's Colossians chapter two, verse 21 and down.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:28.080]   It says these rules and regulations are not effective in controlling the desire that's
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.000]   placed in your heart.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.200]   The sin that's inside and internal cannot be dealt with by external regulation and law.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.040]   So it doesn't help you.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.480]   It rather only binds you in the knowledge of your sin more.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.080]   Okay.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:51.920]   I want to make a really important transition now to what I like to get at.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:58.280]   Apostle Paul in context is teaching Christians who are being tempted by the teaching of going
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.960]   back to legalism as a means to get right with God.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.480]   Why is that so upsetting?
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:12.280]   At face value, it seems like it's so upsetting because it just doesn't work for us.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.280]   It's not good for us.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.100]   And I've preached that before.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.160]   As a matter of fact, I look back on my sermon about three months ago and I said exactly
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.040]   those words like, "You can't be a legalist when you feel dry."
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.260]   Let's say you backslid for a little bit.
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.480]   Some of us in this room, I know we've had moments where we didn't deal with God.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.560]   We neglected God.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.880]   And then someone asks like, "Well, you need to get your act together."
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.520]   And you're like, "Yeah, what I need to do is X, Y, Z."
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.000]   And then you think, "I'm just going to come back to church.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I'm going to go into worship.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.080]   I'm going to serve and it's going to be right."
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.680]   And then I would say, "That kind of legalism is wrong."
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.680]   Why?
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.040]   Because it makes you feel guilty and it makes you feel more guilty and the next thing you
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.280]   know you're going to be in a pit.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.880]   That's all true.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.520]   The greatest reason why I see from the study of the book of Galatians why legalism is so
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:03.880]   bad is not because of what it does to you or how it lacks to help you.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:10.240]   Obviously, the greatest reason why legalism is wrong is because it offends our Father.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.760]   Let me say that again.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:20.320]   The greatest reason why legalism is wrong is because it absolutely offends our Father.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.320]   Why do I say that?
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.760]   Because if you turn back over to Galatians chapter one, turn back to Galatians chapter
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:34.240]   one, it says in verse six, as he is riled up and enraged by what the church is in danger
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.640]   of doing, he says, "I am amazed," this is verse six, okay, chapter one, verse six, Galatians,
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:46.760]   "I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by grace of Christ for
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.080]   a different gospel, which is really not another."
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.240]   Do you notice that little nuance of what he's saying?
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.920]   He's not saying, "I'm so surprised you forgot what I said."
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.800]   He says, he doesn't say, "I'm so surprised you're neglecting this sacred doctrine.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.560]   I'm so surprised you're leaving our church."
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.920]   He says, "I'm so surprised you're abandoning our God."
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:12.520]   It's offensive to our God because when you practice, whether it's a formal, whether it's
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:17.880]   a practical legalism, you offend and deny God.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.880]   How so?
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:28.400]   Well, again, for me, as any other human being, typically if I have sinned or if I have done
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:34.000]   something that is not right before God, I go through the litany of all the sinful responses
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.280]   to it where I try to distract myself and not think about it, so I go off and do work.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.000]   I clean, I do whatever it takes.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.440]   I go talk to people, whatever it is.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.880]   I sometimes hide, I neglect, and then I start thinking I should fix it, so I'm going to
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.200]   just go do this and that and that, I need to go do a good work, so to speak.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.360]   I go through all of that and I have to sit there like, "Oh, you know you're not supposed
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.160]   to do this, all this stuff," right?
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:05.320]   Well, in the midst of that, again, there is a subtle thought, there is this subtle, deep,
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:14.040]   arrogant, false humility thought, "I am going to fix it by rectifying this relationship
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.600]   with God by some work."
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.280]   Why is that offensive?
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.400]   Because the reality of the relationship that we have.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.840]   I want to pose to you a kind of scenario, okay?
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:33.520]   Let's say, again, you wronged your father, but you had a sense of conviction and you
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.680]   knew it was wrong, so you wanted to go back and reconcile that relationship, and so you
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:43.560]   decide, "Dad, I know you sacrificed for me since we were young.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.400]   Sometimes you sacrifice your own well-being, your own health for our well-being.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   You cared for me, I realize, for such a long time, decades, literally, and I know I wronged
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:01.080]   you, so here, I got you this teacher that says, 'Best Dad.'"
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.080]   Okay?
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.840]   Obviously, the father would kind of sit there and be like, "This is weird.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:13.040]   I don't know how in any way you thought this would actually solve the situation.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.560]   I don't even want to wear your shirt."
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.520]   You know, maybe a better analogy is this, okay?
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.880]   Try going to your mom.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.960]   Try going to your mom, and if you wronged her or if you've done anything, even if you
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:33.680]   didn't wrong her, you wanted to go and you wanted to thank her in some way, and so you
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.240]   go to her house and she's cooking all this meal, and then you say, "So, how much for
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   dinner?"
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   She's like, "What?
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   I didn't buy it.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.240]   I cooked it."
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.280]   She's like, "Oh, no, no, I know.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.520]   You cook, and I'm so thankful.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.520]   I just want to...
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.520]   I mean, 10 bucks?
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.520]   5 bucks?"
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.840]   I would imagine your mom would do one of these, "Oh, yeah?"
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.960]   Just like raise the hand.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:04.640]   You cannot dare say that to a parent, as though in your gratitude, you would dare try to pay
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.640]   or do something by which you would all of a sudden say, "Okay, now I'm going to pay
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.800]   for you to make this all right, to make it all worthwhile."
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.240]   That is a false humility and a false arrogance.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.360]   Sorry, that's arrogance at its core, but it's so subtle.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.040]   We do it all the time.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.280]   And you see, why is it so bad?
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.920]   It's not so much because it affects us and our guilt.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:34.320]   We need to stop thinking of ourselves even in the way we deal with sin.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.840]   Even in the way we deal with sin, we realize legalism is wrong because it offends our holy
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.120]   God and that's why in the book of Galatians, he goes at length to describe, "Look, you
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.640]   are not like a regular slave in the house.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.640]   You are a son.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.840]   And if you're a son, you have a relationship with God where you cry out, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.160]   And that's all of chapter 4.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.560]   And if you are a son, then you have all the privilege of a son and you have the inheritance
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.560]   of the Father.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.880]   Why are you acting like a slave?
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.360]   You are a free person.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.200]   And that's the encouragement Scripture asks for you.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.920]   And I find that to be so insightful.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.280]   Apostle Paul is battling legalism and his first offense to battle legalism is, "You
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.480]   are free.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   Stop thinking like a slave.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.840]   Stop putting yourself under the same yoke."
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.680]   But it's something that we do sometimes.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:34.200]   And so, Apostle Paul makes this strong admonition that we need to be thinking carefully about
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:42.120]   how we approach not just what we believe to be sin and how we deal with it, but even the
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:48.320]   secondary idea of how do we respond in all of that to God and sin.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.600]   My point was, the Jews looked at the law and saw it as a solution.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.320]   For us, the solution is not external.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.520]   The solution is not outside of us.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.160]   The solution is going to be Christ in us.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.160]   Amen?
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.080]   The solution is going to be internal.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.720]   The Spirit convicting and moving and guiding.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.000]   The Spirit allowing us to cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.600]   The Spirit allowing us to have that relationship.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.920]   It's a bit of intangible.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:19.680]   It's a bit of something that we can't necessarily exhaustively describe into words, but it's
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:25.440]   an experience that you and I should all be aware of when we think of what is this freedom,
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:30.840]   what is this ability to come back to a restored relationship with God based not on external
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.120]   law, but based on what God is doing inside of us.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:44.440]   Now as you think about that, by way of transition, the Jews accused Apostle Paul and said, "You
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.020]   go against our law?
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.160]   You go against Moses?
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.880]   You must be one of these libertarian, we do whatever we want, anti-Gnomean, there is no
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.840]   law above us, anarchists."
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:04.520]   And that's what the Pharisees and the Jews would regularly attack Apostle Paul with.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.760]   And they would say, "Don't listen to this man.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:11.640]   He rejects the laws, he rejects the temple, he rejects God."
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:17.200]   Because in Apostle Paul's saying, we've been freed from that law, the bondage of trying
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.280]   to do something that you're not capable of doing.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.400]   And you only have this fear of utter judgment because that's what the law states.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.520]   You're free.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.040]   And so a bunch of people are sitting there like, "So we just do whatever?"
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.000]   What is Apostle Paul going to say to that?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.760]   Of course not.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.400]   So earlier I asked this question, "Well what is freedom?
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.400]   What does it entail?"
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.920]   And we're getting glimpses and pieces of that.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.280]   And right now what Apostle Paul is going to do is say, "This is what freedom is not."
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:51.160]   So please turn your eyes over to verse 13 through 15.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.160]   Okay?
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.160]   Verse 13 through 15.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:59.560]   What freedom is not, as a means to define what freedom actually is.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.880]   He says this, "For you were called to freedom."
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   Right?
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.960]   So he reiterates this idea.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.480]   God has called you to freedom.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.960]   He wants you to experience it.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.960]   He wants you to have it.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.560]   It's a gift from the Lord.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:17.280]   But then he says, "Only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.200]   But through love serve one another.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.880]   For the whole law is fulfilled in one word.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.160]   In the statement, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:31.040]   But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another."
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.040]   Okay?
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.400]   So essentially what I'm going to say is this.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.600]   First and foremost, yes, you as a Christian, we have a freedom.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.880]   But it is not the same definition as the world currently describes it.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   If you look up freedom in the Webster Dictionary, it's going to say, "The power or ability
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:56.000]   to think, say, and do whatever you desire."
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.040]   Now that is freedom on a general definition.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.480]   You have no encumbrance.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.840]   You have no hindrance to whatever you want to do.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.840]   Is that biblical freedom?
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.880]   Is that the freedom to which God has called you?
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.120]   No.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:15.600]   Actually, God has called you to a great restraint in freedom to which you do not make your freedom
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:21.520]   a platform for sin, selfishness, and the flesh.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:27.180]   He says, essentially, another way to put it is, "Your freedom is conditioned by the holiness
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.320]   of God."
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:35.080]   Just as discipline, regulation, and law without holiness is absolute hypocrisy, your freedom
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:39.280]   without holiness is absolute flesh, hedonism.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.760]   It's just as bad.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.760]   Okay?
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.240]   And so Paul says, "Don't get me wrong.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.760]   You've been called to freedom, but this freedom is not like the world."
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:53.360]   Our generation in America says, "I get to say whatever I want.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.400]   I have the right."
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.240]   And then they expect, "And you better defend my right to do that."
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.040]   That's this generation.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.840]   That is not the kind of freedom the rest of the world is thinking about.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.400]   That is not the kind of freedom the Bible is thinking about.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.840]   That is the kind of freedom only a privileged, very few in a, you know, entitlement kind
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.760]   of culture demands.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.440]   But that is not of the Bible.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.520]   The scripture says, "Your freedom is one that is conditioned by the holiness of God, and
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.960]   it cannot be a license for the flesh."
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:30.120]   Please turn your Bibles to 2 Peter 2.18 as another reiteration of this truth.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.720]   2 Peter 2.18 and down.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:38.920]   I'm going to go to verse 22, and this is what the passage says.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:44.400]   2 Peter, "For speaking loud boasts of folly, they entice by sensual passions of the flesh
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.000]   those who are barely escaping from those who live in error.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.480]   They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.760]   For whatever overcomes a person to that, he is enslaved.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.680]   For if after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:04.480]   Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.400]   The last day has become worse for them than the first.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.960]   For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness, than
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   for after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.560]   What the true Proverbs says has happened to them, the dogs return to his own vomit, and
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:24.600]   so, after washing herself, returns to wallow in the mire."
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.440]   I want to say a couple things about that.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.440]   Okay?
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.320]   I want to just say a couple things about that.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:37.120]   The first thing I want to say is, again, we're talking about right now what freedom is not.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:42.840]   And you know how earlier I said legalism, okay, would really offend God.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:48.360]   This passage in 2 Peter is telling us, on the opposite, if you turn your freedom into
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:54.040]   licentiousness, you are actually worse.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.360]   For somebody to have received the grace of God, somebody to have received the freedom
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.880]   of God, somebody to have received the provision of God, then to after that turn that into
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:10.200]   a springboard for their selfishness, that actually offends God even more.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   Does it not?
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.120]   And we think about that in the analogy of the father again.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.520]   I mean, it makes sense.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:22.040]   Somebody outside of your house, somebody outside of your circle, the privileges of your organization,
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:26.200]   of your nation, whatever it may be, they're trying whatever it may be, and they're doing
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:31.000]   whatever they want to, okay, you're not a part of us.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.160]   But if you come in saying, "I'm going to abide by your law, I'm going to abide by your
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.600]   grace, I'm going to abide by what you expect, I'm going to abide by what you're pleased
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:44.320]   by," and then once you receive that, then you go off and make that a rationale, an excuse
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.360]   to indulge your flesh, God is even more offended.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.360]   And he says the second state has become even worse.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:58.280]   But it's an interesting condition that we have where we do that.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.240]   We have freedom, and then we turn it into a license.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.600]   I remember there was a time in my first year in seminary, we were learning Greek, and everybody
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   was just dying.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.600]   Everybody was just like, "I can't do this."
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.600]   There was a guy that actually cried.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:14.320]   And we said, "You're going to get through it, man.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.640]   It's just school."
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:23.720]   But our professor was one of these crazy, hard professors, and he had an exam every
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.200]   single week.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.680]   And so people were up all night Thursday to study for their exam on Friday.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.120]   Well halfway through the semester, he realizes all these students are grumbling, and they're
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.840]   just like, "Oh my gosh," and they're not doing well on their quizzes.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.280]   And so he decides on Friday, "Guys, I have great news.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.280]   Quiz canceled."
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.120]   Everyone's looking at each other like, "Yeah!"
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.480]   And the next week, he does the same thing.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.400]   "Guys, I have great news.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.400]   Quiz canceled."
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.400]   And everyone's like, "Great relief."
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.960]   Third week comes along, Thursday, nobody studies.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.960]   Friday comes along, he's like, "Okay, guys, we have quiz."
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.960]   And everyone's like, "Oh, that's not fair!"
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:01.680]   Like a bunch of people bomb the quiz, you know?
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:09.040]   The fact of the matter is, we're just accustomed to allowing for a platform of grace, a platform
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:15.520]   of freedom, and we use it for an abuse of freedom.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:21.960]   And that's many ways this generation and this culture in America, right?
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.760]   And I wish if God would bless America, God would bless America by conviction we have
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:31.000]   become an incredibly self-abusive culture, where we take the freedom that we have and
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.440]   we just run with it.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:38.320]   I don't care if you have a problem, I don't care if what I'm doing is gross, perverse,
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.320]   it's my freedom!
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.760]   I'm just gonna do it!
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.760]   Watch me!
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.760]   And then the media, and then everything that's coming out through this generation is that
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.760]   kind of rank abuse of freedom.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:57.040]   Was that freedom used for greater service, greater humility, greater acts of benevolence
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.640]   and kindness and humanitarian efforts?
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.440]   Was that freedom used for greater righteousness?
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.800]   Most of the stuff, when they say, "Hey, we have the freedom of speech!"
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.960]   Now it's a lot of gross immorality.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.960]   That's an abuse!
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:14.880]   And the Apostle Paul says, "That is not the kind of freedom God has called you to."
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:20.880]   And what's more, I want to say that our freedom is conditioned by a love for others.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:26.440]   And we see that coming back to Galatians chapter 5, the second half of verse 13.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:32.280]   He says in the second half of verse 13, "But through love serve one another, for the whole
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.640]   law is fulfilled in one word."
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.560]   In this statement, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself, but if you bite and you devour
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.360]   one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another."
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:52.260]   So the idea here is, what I'm saying, you guys get what I'm saying, is this is a caricature
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:56.400]   of the freedom that a lot of people think they're supposed to have.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.160]   I should have a freedom where I'm not bound, or I should have a freedom where there are
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:05.820]   no restrictions, where there are no burdens, where there are no hindrances.
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:09.960]   But now I'm making the point that the freedom, paradoxically, that the Scriptures call us
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.640]   to is not a kind of freedom by which we're just free from all things.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:19.680]   It's a freedom though that is actually very well confined by God and by others.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:27.160]   See this world again says stuff like, you know, whether someone else's freedom is hindered
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.360]   or not, I still have rights to my own.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:34.180]   And I don't want to bring up too much of current events or whatnot, but it just appalls me
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:40.560]   that for the freedom of right to express oneself for very few, then the freedom of a bunch
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.400]   of other people are just going to be squashed.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:47.740]   You guys probably know what I'm talking about, this whole idea with gender neutral bathrooms
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:48.740]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.640]   To me it's just absolutely ridiculous.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:56.400]   It's like, I don't care, I have my right.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.240]   That is an incredibly selfish way to think.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.460]   But the fact of the matter is, that is the way this generation espouses the practice
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.460]   of freedom.
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:13.200]   But Apostle Paul and God teaches in the Scripture that our freedom is actually very well conditioned
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.520]   by the love of other people.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:20.960]   To the degree that in other parts of Scripture, for example, Romans chapter 14 and 1 Corinthians
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:27.040]   chapter 8 through 10 says that our liberties, our freedoms, are actually constantly held
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.040]   in check.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:32.160]   And Apostle Paul says, "I would actually sacrifice some of the liberties that I have to the degree
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.220]   that I would not even eat meat."
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.520]   I wouldn't even eat meat should it hinder somebody else.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.560]   If it's not beneficial to my fellow brother in the church, and it rebukes the church,
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.800]   you think you're so mature because you know something?
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.520]   Why don't you know how to love?
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:54.960]   And your liberties and your freedoms need to be conditioned by this love.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:02.880]   So the point that I'm making is, the freedom that we have is conditioned by God and by
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.560]   love for others.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.480]   To me, at that point, I'm going to be honest, when I was reading the book of Galatians,
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.160]   I was confused.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.440]   How is that freedom then?
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:18.920]   To what can we write as a definition for freedom?
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:24.160]   And what's really interesting is, I want to read to you the next passage or the rest of
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.120]   the chapter in hopes that Apostle Paul would give us the definition.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.880]   Well this is what he says, verse 16 down to verse 24.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.840]   Or I'm going to read to 25.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.420]   But I say walk in the spirit.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:43.240]   So in contrast to that kind of pagan freedom that people think you have, rather, verse
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.360]   16, walk in the spirit.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.040]   And you will not carry out the desire of your flesh.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.280]   For the flesh sets its desire against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.920]   For these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.000]   please.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.520]   But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:02.240]   So far I have, walk in the spirit, be led by the spirit.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:07.360]   And verse 19, now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are immorality, impurity, sensuality,
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:13.000]   idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.400]   factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these of which I have forewarned
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.800]   you, just as I have forewarned you that those who practice such things will not inherit
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.200]   the kingdom of God.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.960]   But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.680]   gentleness, self-control.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.880]   Against such things there is no law.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.400]   Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with his passions and
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.440]   desires.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.040]   If we live by the spirit, let us also walk by the spirit.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.120]   So far in the rest of the chapter, all that he said is, be in the spirit, be led by the
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.120]   spirit, right?
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:53.600]   Walk in the spirit, be in step with the spirit, have the spirit, be in Christ.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:59.160]   And now I've got to start drawing some dots and lines and saying, how does this all connect?
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:06.280]   He's utterly destroyed my false concept of freedom, which I believe is why I was so frustrated.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:12.280]   Because I thought my freedom was supposed to be, I shouldn't have experience of burden.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.680]   I thought my freedom was supposed to be, I should be free from that kind of anxiety,
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.840]   free from stress, free from the fight, free from the struggle.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.240]   That's actually not the case, is it?
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.840]   There are a lot of conditions.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.360]   There's actually more conditions that I have to abide in God's holiness, I have to abide
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.720]   in love towards others, and now he says I have to abide in the spirit.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.440]   How is that freedom?
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.960]   How in the world is that freedom?
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.880]   And I sat there and I just kind of wondered, like, and do I even know how to experience
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.240]   it then?
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.960]   Do I know what it entails?
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.920]   And how would I explain somebody else to experience this freedom?
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.600]   And I realized what's happening in the world right now is a great analogy for what this
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.480]   freedom is.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:01.720]   I've actually been sometimes up late at night just watching videos of the kind of crisis
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.000]   that is happening for the world around us.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.960]   We've been hearing about Syrian refugees for a long time now.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:12.880]   And we've been hearing and seeing videos, and sometimes, you guys could probably relate,
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.240]   watching those videos is actually very difficult.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.280]   Sometimes I just have to turn away.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.960]   And then I come back because it's just wrenching my heart.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:26.120]   Where you watch the videos of the Syrian refugees land on the shores of whether it be Germany,
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:31.380]   England, or whatever it may be, and you see, like, not all of them make it.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:35.220]   You see moms holding kids and the kids don't make it.
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:40.080]   And you see them just, in their explanation, they're like, "We had to go."
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.080]   Right?
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.400]   "We just had to go."
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.480]   And it just breaks my heart.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.520]   And then, I don't know if you're aware, but these countries in Northern Africa, like Libya
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:54.160]   and all that kind of stuff, or Liberia, the situation is just as severe.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:41:00.040]   It's just not read about because it's so poor and it's been going on for so long, people
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.120]   don't know about it that much.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:07.780]   But supposedly, the coast guards catch, like one coast guard catch about four different
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.780]   boats per day.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.460]   And each boat has about 40 people in it.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.220]   And these boats are actually wooden boats.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.560]   They're just inflated rafts.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:19.460]   And you have people either hanging on the side, or it's so packed, everybody side to
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.060]   side, and people have fall off.
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.700]   And essentially, the coast guards would follow this boat.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.500]   And the reason why they can follow this boat is because they can follow the trail of bodies.
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:33.700]   And on these boats, they would find kids, they would find people in the boat who are
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:34.700]   drowning.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.700]   And they said that right now, in just one of the Northern African countries, over 3,000
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.740]   people die in the water every year.
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.700]   And I watched the videos and I'm just appalled.
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:50.940]   Just to think, like, what conditions are you living in that you think having no water,
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:58.060]   no food, just clothes on your back, and going out into the ocean is better?
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:01.780]   And then so they get interviewed and they ask, "What do you want?"
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.660]   Do you know what they say?
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.840]   We want freedom.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.340]   But they don't say, "I want the freedom to express myself.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:12.260]   I want the freedom for all the sexual provisions that I want.
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.020]   I want the freedom to do and say whatever I want to."
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:18.100]   That is not what they say.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.460]   They say, "I want freedom.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.460]   I want protection.
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:23.980]   I want rights.
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.580]   I want to be cared for.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.620]   I want an opportunity to work and labor."
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.420]   Right?
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.940]   So what is freedom in their eyes?
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.580]   It is not complete liberation from all kinds of influence.
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:39.260]   It is actually the care of a greater nation over them.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.860]   That is our gospel in Jesus Christ.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:49.040]   To have the benevolent, loving God care for us, and to be under Him.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.900]   To be under His protection.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.580]   To have His rights.
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:53.580]   His oversight.
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:54.580]   His freedom.
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:55.580]   Does that make sense?
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:00.180]   And so in my mind now, that makes very clear sense what it means to be free, truly free
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.180]   in God.
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:04.300]   You were once under the kingdom of darkness, the kingdom of Satan.
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:07.140]   You were oppressed.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.020]   Now you are in the kingdom of His Son.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.180]   And there is your freedom.
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:16.260]   Not that you are liberated from even God and all kinds of other influences.
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.900]   But now you are actually all the more restrained under Him.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:19.900]   You are in Him.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:21.220]   You are controlled by Him.
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:24.220]   You are provided for by Him.
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:25.940]   That is our freedom.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.700]   And one of the interesting truths is this.
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:35.060]   That even in the law, in Exodus chapter 21, it states that amongst a random list of laws,
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:39.540]   that a slave who is a Jew would serve for six years, and on the seventh year he would
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.540]   be let go.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.260]   It is freedom.
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:48.820]   But that slave has the right, if he so loves his master, can say, "Master, I love you.
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.060]   Keep me in your house."
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:56.500]   And so that master would take that slave, take his earlobe and pierce it into the door.
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.780]   And say, "Essentially now, you are affixed to this house.
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.100]   You are a part of this home.
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.540]   You are now underneath the protection of this home."
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:08.460]   And that slave is now doing the same thing, but he is now in the house.
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.460]   In the house is our freedom.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.180]   Does that make sense?
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.900]   That's the gospel for us.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:20.780]   And so sometimes I sit there and I think, "Ah, silly Mark.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:26.180]   You're so frustrated, not because God didn't give you freedom.
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:31.940]   You're so frustrated because you have still yet to submit to the oversight of God, to
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.420]   the leadership of the Spirit in your heart.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:38.260]   And for some odd reason, you still want to make it on your own.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.620]   You still want to fix your problems.
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:41.780]   You still want to address your own issues.
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:46.220]   You still want to do your own thing, and you're not willing to let go.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.100]   That's frustration.
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:52.420]   That's a world of hurt, and you're going to hurt yourself for the long run."
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:56.140]   The best thing for us is to trust.
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.020]   Is to trust our Savior.
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:01.860]   The best thing for us is to see that this is spiritual reality.
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.380]   He is our loving Father.
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:08.620]   And when I do not embrace and receive the promises that He has, and when I come to the
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:13.060]   table, even if you're already a Christian, and even if you've been struggling, and you
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:16.940]   say, "You know, I come not because, 'Oh, I believe Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:18.300]   I believe Jesus Christ is Messiah.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.660]   I believe Jesus Christ is divine, and I believe He's the Savior because He sacrificed.'
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.820]   Can I come in?"
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.820]   That's your theology.
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.580]   And if you say, "You know what?
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:26.580]   I've been coming back to the church.
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:27.580]   I've been coming back to do this.
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:28.580]   I've been serving.
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:29.580]   I've been doing all this, tithing, all this kind of stuff.
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.580]   Can I come in?"
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.580]   No.
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.140]   What you need to say is, "I've got nothing.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:36.260]   I never have, don't have now.
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:41.620]   I come because you've promised, and I'm taking you up on your promise.
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.020]   Receive me."
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.940]   That's the way we come.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.860]   That is the way God is honored and pleased.
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:48.860]   Amen?
[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:49.860]   Let's pray.
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:59.340]   Father, Lord, we want to take a moment to repent of the fact that oftentimes it could
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:05.100]   be just simply we are so small in our perspective, God.
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:10.940]   We don't understand exactly what we're doing, but we thank you then that you reveal to us,
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:12.020]   Lord.
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:17.780]   This is not our sin, our plight in life, this life that we live in the flesh.
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:21.420]   These are not issues we overcome on our own.
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:25.580]   Father, God, we need to come to you and be under your care.
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:31.820]   So I pray that we would experience that freedom, truly being underneath you, in your care,
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.440]   abiding in the Spirit, and being led by him.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:38.500]   And I ask that this whole week, if there are things that we are holding onto in this world,
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.920]   I pray we let it go.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:44.140]   If there is legalistic tendencies and prideful acts of self-righteousness, I pray we let
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:48.580]   it go, so that, Lord, we would experience you to the full.
[00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:51.260]   And Lord, by your grace, would you continue to forgive us and guide us.
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.660]   This we pray in Christ's name.
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:53.180]   Amen.
