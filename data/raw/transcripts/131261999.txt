[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740]   (audio cuts out)
[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.400]   And so they would be like, "Pastor Peter, Pastor Peter!"
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.000]   And then, you know, like, yeah,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   of course I would turn around too,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.760]   but then my first reaction would be like,
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.100]   "Oh, don't say that!
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.560]   "Like, who's saying that?"
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.440]   I just wanna say that I'm very appreciative of SBK
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.440]   and very thankful for just how he's been coming out to China
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.200]   and supporting our work and, you know,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.520]   just being a good friend and older brother to us.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.240]   And I also wanna thank you guys as a church
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.720]   for supporting us, for praying for us.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.780]   It's been really, really wonderful
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.120]   to have your guys' support as well.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.000]   I just wanted to share this one quick little thing.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.960]   It was really good to see all the children up front, right?
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.480]   And I noticed that one of the children's
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.800]   was named Jedediah.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.480]   And I was like, "Oh, man, that was the name
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.120]   "that I wanted to name my son."
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.520]   But Pauly didn't let me.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.000]   I was like, and then also our parents couldn't pronounce it.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.520]   I've been out in China for the past five years,
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.320]   and I noticed that a lot of things in America have changed.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.960]   And one of the things that I noticed was that, you know,
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.360]   I would hear from different people
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.480]   that may come and visit us,
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.080]   or as I came back, I would hear just from different friends
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.000]   about this word that's been kind of popular these days,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.560]   and the word is missional.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.920]   And a lot of people say that they wanna be
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.760]   a missional church.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.260]   They say that we wanna live a missional lifestyle.
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.000]   Have you guys heard of this term before?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.860]   I don't know if you have or not.
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.560]   But this idea of being missional
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.460]   is like being kind of intentional.
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.160]   And we've heard a lot of these types of terms in the past,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.120]   like we wanna be a missional church,
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.280]   we wanna be a healthy church,
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.720]   we wanna be an intentional person,
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.960]   we wanna be a church with a vision,
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.440]   or maybe some of us have heard,
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.680]   you know, I wanna be more passionate.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.640]   These are all carrying the same idea,
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.040]   and we understand the meaning of it,
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.700]   of this word missional,
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.020]   but I feel like maybe it's not very helpful,
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.380]   it's not necessary to use this word.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.360]   Missions, for a long while,
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.740]   was specifically defined as Christian ministry
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.160]   done cross-culturally.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.560]   Missions is about going to a place that is not your home,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.580]   that has a different culture, maybe a different language.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.320]   Going to a completely different place
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.840]   that you don't know about, that you haven't grown up in,
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.500]   and doing God's work there.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.000]   That's what missions is about.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.620]   Now, if we use this idea missional in our lives,
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.800]   it could kinda confuse the idea,
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.660]   the definition of missions.
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.920]   And I think that it could also possibly elevate missions
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.640]   as this spiritual, highly spiritual activity.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.240]   Because, you know, we say we wanna be missional,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.440]   and so it means like,
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.080]   oh, because people that go out on missions,
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.400]   it's such an important thing,
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.360]   and it's such a spiritual thing,
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.080]   and so we kinda elevate missions like that.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.040]   Or, it can actually lower the idea of missions,
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.760]   because we say, you know, we could be missional anywhere.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.760]   Wherever we go, we could be missional here,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.960]   and so we don't necessarily need to go overseas.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.800]   In any case, I feel like we don't necessarily need
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.380]   to use this word missional.
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.400]   We could just use the word that we've always used,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.200]   and that is, we need to be people in a church
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.440]   that make disciples.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.440]   You may recognize today's passage.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.720]   Today's passage comes from Matthew chapter 28.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.160]   If you have your Bibles or your cell phone Bible apps,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.720]   please open up to Matthew chapter 28,
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.000]   and verses 18 to 20.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.280]   You guys may recognize this passage as a passage
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.760]   that's maybe spoken a lot on during like mission send-offs,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.860]   or when a pastor wants to speak on missions,
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.820]   and it's good, it's a good thing.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.380]   Matthew chapter 28, verses 18 to 20.
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.300]   A lot of us know this passage as the Great Commission.
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.420]   And we'll find today that the Great Commission
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.180]   is actually the work that all churches and individuals
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.420]   who are followers of Christ should be involved in.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.380]   All of us should be involved in it.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.980]   And so, this is the reading of God's word.
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.480]   Matthew chapter 28, verse 18 to 20.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.180]   Then Jesus came to them and said,
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.140]   "All authority in heaven and on earth
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.900]   "has been given to me.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.380]   "Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations,
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.420]   "baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.780]   "and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.940]   "and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.740]   "And surely, I am with you always
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.700]   "to the very end of the age."
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.520]   Let's pray.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.980]   God, we thank you so much
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.740]   that you are the God of this universe,
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.700]   you are the God of this whole world,
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.740]   and we know that people all around the world
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.340]   are worshiping you today.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.660]   Lord, I know that my friends in China
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.260]   have already worshiped you hours ago.
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.620]   And Lord, I know that many others
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.180]   have been worshiping you during that time.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.680]   And Lord, and now it's our turn to come before you today
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.580]   to worship you, to hear your word.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.540]   And I pray, Lord, that everyone here,
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.040]   as we look to your word, that you would teach us,
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.700]   that you would grow us,
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.420]   and Lord, that we may understand and obey you.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.980]   And so, we lift this time up to you.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.740]   (congregation applauding)
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:55.800]   Before we look at the actual command of this passage,
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.960]   I started today's passage by looking at verse 18.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.440]   And a lot of other people, when they speak from this passage,
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.560]   they may start from verse 19.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.920]   But I started from verse 18,
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.960]   and I want us to look at that verse 18 again.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.440]   It says, "Then Jesus came to them and said,
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.880]   "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.480]   If we think about the book of Matthew,
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.680]   the book of Matthew was largely written
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.760]   to a Jewish community, largely a Jewish community.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.840]   And when we look at the book of Matthew,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.000]   we'll see that, we can see that there are a lot of passages
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.100]   that refer to the Old Testament.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.280]   There are a lot of references that may make more sense
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.760]   to a Jewish audience than to a Gentile audience.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.440]   We see that through the book of Matthew,
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.760]   we see that Jesus is the Messiah that was to come.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.200]   And towards the end of the book of Matthew,
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.900]   we see that Jesus Christ was, suffered.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.720]   He had his passion, he suffered.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.240]   And then he died on the cross, he was crucified.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.680]   And then in the last chapter, in chapter 28,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.180]   we find that Jesus Christ, okay, I have to say this.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.400]   I've been in China for five years,
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.060]   and my English has gone down a little bit.
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.780]   So please excuse me if I stutter a little bit.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.900]   We find that in chapter 28, Jesus Christ,
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.240]   he rises again from the dead.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.560]   And Jesus comes and appears before all of his disciples,
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.120]   and he says, "All authority in heaven and on earth
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.540]   "has been given to me.
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.320]   "I have conquered sin, I have conquered death.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.880]   "I am the true Messiah that was to come.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.280]   "I am the king, I am the king of all kings,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.800]   "and I come before you, my disciples,
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.920]   "as the king to give you this command."
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:47.480]   And so as the king gives us a command,
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.440]   we find that the Great Commission
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.160]   is not just something that we listen to,
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.360]   and maybe it's what the missionaries do overseas.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.920]   We find that this is a law for us.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.920]   This is something that we must do.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.520]   All of us must be involved in,
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.120]   and it's something that we need to constantly
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.040]   be conscious about in our everyday lives.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.680]   So what is the command that Jesus gives to us?
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.300]   In verse 19, it says, "Therefore,
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.220]   "go and make disciples of all nations,
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.980]   "baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.880]   "and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.680]   "and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you."
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.260]   This is the command,
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.180]   to go and make disciples of all nations.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.900]   And then it says, it says make disciples of all nations.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.220]   You know, a lot of times we think of this
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.780]   as like going overseas somewhere,
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.740]   but it doesn't necessarily have to mean that.
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.420]   What it could mean is,
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.980]   go and make disciples wherever you go,
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.260]   wherever you are, in your workplaces,
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.140]   at home, wherever you are.
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.440]   Make disciples.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.640]   And how do we make disciples?
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.740]   The passage tells us, how do we make disciples?
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.580]   It says, "Baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.460]   "and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.140]   "and also teaching them to obey."
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.580]   Okay, how do we make disciples?
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.700]   The first step is that we need to baptize them.
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.020]   And baptizing them doesn't necessarily mean
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.420]   just like, you know, hey, baptized, boom, you know?
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.500]   Baptizing means that you need to go through the process
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.340]   of evangelizing to them,
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.620]   of being a witness to people that don't believe yet.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.780]   Baptizing them incorporates this whole process
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.780]   of working with people that don't believe,
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.780]   so that they may come to believe,
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.700]   so that they may be baptized,
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.500]   and recognized as a believer in Jesus Christ.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.060]   Now, I'm not gonna go into a lot of detail
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.580]   about baptism or evangelism.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.500]   There are a lot of other times
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.820]   that we could talk about this.
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.660]   But the Great Commission,
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.920]   I wanna say that the Great Commission
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.140]   is not just about evangelism.
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.660]   The Great Commission is not just about going somewhere
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.540]   and telling people about Jesus Christ.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.260]   Because in the second portion in verse 20,
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.700]   Jesus also says, "And teaching them to obey everything
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.180]   "I have commanded you."
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.060]   The Great Commission is also about teaching
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.320]   what Jesus Christ has commanded.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.480]   These two things, baptizing, evangelizing,
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.860]   and bringing them to Christ,
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.180]   and also teaching them and growing them,
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.820]   is all part of the Great Commission.
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.820]   And so how is this fulfilled,
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.800]   especially the teaching aspect?
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.380]   It's primarily done through the church.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.380]   Every single Sunday, a message, a sermon is given
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.820]   teaching us what Christ has taught us.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.180]   And that's why the message, the sermon, is so important.
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.060]   I can't stress this enough.
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.580]   What our pastors do coming up here
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.600]   and teaching us God's word is an important,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.920]   an extremely important thing,
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.820]   and through that, the Great Commission is being fulfilled.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:09.180]   Because the message teaches us, the sermon teaches us
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.700]   how to view this world, how to act in our daily lives,
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.480]   how to look at this world through God's eyes,
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.560]   how to live in God's ways.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.760]   But not only is discipleship done
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.940]   through the speaking of God's word,
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.100]   not only is discipleship done through the teaching
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.660]   on the pulpit, but discipleship is also done
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.300]   through our live examples,
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.440]   through how we live our lives in front of other people.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.000]   Let's look at Jesus.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.880]   Let's look at his example.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.640]   Jesus Christ was with his disciples for three years.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.780]   Jesus Christ was with his disciples,
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.160]   and the disciples followed him wherever he went.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.360]   They saw him sleep.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.320]   They knew how he slept.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.840]   They saw how he woke up early in the morning and prayed,
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.380]   how at times he distanced himself from them
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.660]   and took time to pray.
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.100]   He saw how he, the disciples saw how Jesus Christ
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.980]   went to those that were poor, that were sick.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.100]   They saw how he went to the sinners,
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.340]   to their homes, and ate with them.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.180]   Jesus Christ was an example to them.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.220]   The disciples weren't just learning
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.940]   through what Jesus taught.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.160]   They were also learning through everything
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.580]   that Jesus Christ did.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:40.900]   And so we, all of us here, are making disciples
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.800]   by what we do as well.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.700]   What we do carries a message as well.
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.960]   Not only do we need to teach people,
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.100]   but the passage says that we need to teach them
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.040]   to obey.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.580]   We know that it's important for us to obey.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.700]   Not just to hear, I mean, it's good.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.340]   It's good for us to gain more knowledge of the word.
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.580]   It's good for us to come on Sundays
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.900]   and listen to the message, to come on Wednesdays
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.400]   or Thursdays or Fridays to gain more knowledge of the word.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.400]   But it's important for us to not only learn about it,
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.700]   but also obey.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.540]   In James chapter two, verses 14 to 20, it says this.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.940]   What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.460]   but he has no works?
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.460]   Can that faith save him?
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.420]   If a brother or sister is without clothing
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.020]   and in need of daily food, and one of you says to them,
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.060]   go in peace, be warmed, and be filled,
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.980]   yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body,
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.860]   what use is that?
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:48.140]   Even so, faith, if it has no works, is dead,
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.780]   being by itself.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.740]   But someone may well say, you have faith and I have works.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.100]   Show me your faith without the works
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.180]   and I will show you my faith by my works.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.460]   You believe that God is one?
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.900]   You do well.
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.340]   The demons also believe and shudder.
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.220]   But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow,
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.400]   that faith without works is useless?
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.380]   We may have a lot of knowledge about God's word,
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.180]   and we may have the knowledge of the gospel,
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.420]   but if you're not carrying it out in obedience,
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.020]   then all of that means nothing.
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:30.340]   We can also see what Christ says in John chapter 14,
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.420]   verse 15.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:37.300]   Jesus says, if you love me, you will keep my commandments.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.820]   And so we see that obedience to Christ
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.780]   is also an expression of love for God.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.340]   And so it's important for us to remember
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.180]   that in carrying out the great commission,
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.700]   we need to teach people, even through our life examples,
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.260]   and teach them to obey.
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:03.140]   In this passage, we see that discipleship,
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:08.140]   making disciples, encompasses the whole process
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:13.100]   of bringing an unbeliever to believe in Jesus Christ,
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.580]   to be baptized, all the way to the point
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.700]   of becoming a mature believer,
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.360]   teaching them to obey everything
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.280]   that Jesus Christ has commanded,
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.100]   all the way to the point of becoming a mature believer.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:30.020]   This whole process is what the great commission is about.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:34.060]   What that means is that all of us are still
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:38.220]   in the process of being made disciples.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.700]   And what that also means is that all of us
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.580]   are in the process and should be in the process
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.700]   of making disciples.
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:53.740]   Now remember, we're not disciples
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.080]   of the person who discipled us,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:02.060]   nor are we the master teacher of the ones we disciple.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.360]   We're not the person that is their teacher,
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.660]   their master of some sorts.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.740]   Rather, we are all disciples of Christ,
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.000]   and we make disciples of Christ,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.400]   meaning we wanna cause people to follow Christ.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:25.860]   The easy part in some ways is bringing a person to Christ,
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.620]   to share the gospel with them,
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.940]   and they may come to believe.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.740]   That part is perhaps the easier part.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.020]   The hard part is discipling them up.
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.940]   In China, I was part of campus ministry,
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.540]   and I was involved in evangelism
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.760]   and bringing a lot of people to believe in Jesus Christ.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.940]   Not a lot, some.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:51.280]   And as we did bring some people to Christ,
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.000]   we wanted to plug them into the churches
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.880]   that already existed there.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.060]   But one of the things that we found out
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.280]   was that the churches that exist there,
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.140]   they have a hard time discipling these people
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.240]   so that these people can come to maturity.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.880]   One of the huge needs that still exists in China
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.880]   is a need for mature older brothers and sisters,
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.460]   mature in the faith, I mean,
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:22.760]   older brothers and sisters to go and be mentors
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.320]   and examples for the many believers in China.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.360]   You know, I was surprised to see
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.800]   that a lot of the people that I met
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.200]   that were in the church in China,
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.960]   a lot of them had only been a Christian
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.880]   for two years, three years, you know, less than five years.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:43.280]   So there's this huge need that still exists in China
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.120]   for people to be examples over there.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.860]   Discipleship is so important.
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.800]   Now, I wanna focus on this idea of discipleship,
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.240]   and I wanna come to the first application question
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.400]   that I wanna ask you guys.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.640]   And that is,
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.520]   if discipleship is so important,
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:09.240]   then whose disciple are you, first of all?
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.800]   Whose disciple are you?
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.240]   Whatever you surround yourself with,
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.160]   you become a disciple of it.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.880]   Whatever you let your ears or your eyes see often,
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.960]   you become a disciple of it.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.080]   Do you watch sports all the time?
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.240]   You become a disciple of that.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.320]   I know people that can quote every statistic.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.920]   You become a disciple of that.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.920]   Always looking at the needs for your children,
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.260]   you become a disciple of your child.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.960]   Always watch some TV show.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:49.280]   I have a friend right now, on Facebook I saw his update,
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.060]   and he was like, "I just started watching Game of Thrones.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.360]   "Oh, what am I doing?"
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.120]   And he kinda did it, I mean, he put it on Facebook,
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.320]   he kinda did it to brag.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.120]   Are you watching a lot of TV shows,
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.960]   or constantly filling your mind with that?
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.040]   You become a disciple of that.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.080]   Are you always online, always on your phone,
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.880]   looking at Facebook?
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.400]   You become a disciple of that.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.880]   Being a disciple is being a student of that person
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.800]   or object, causing you to begin to believe
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.720]   in their beliefs, their wants, and their desires.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.920]   So how are you as a disciple of Christ?
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.400]   But before I ask you this question,
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.320]   before I ask how are you as a disciple of Christ,
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.960]   I wanna ask, what else are you a disciple of?
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.640]   What else are you a disciple of?
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.640]   I had a friend a long time ago, about 10 years ago.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.240]   He loved Apple products.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.160]   And he would be like, "Man, you're still using your PC?
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.000]   "What's wrong with you?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.160]   "You should get an Apple product.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.520]   "Look at my sleek, doesn't it look so nice?"
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.960]   And he's just talking about his computer,
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.960]   and then later on, iPhones and stuff.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.080]   He was an Apple evangelist.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.280]   Like, are you a disciple of Apple?
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.600]   Are you a disciple of, I don't know, music?
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.400]   What are you filling your ears with?
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.760]   Are you a disciple of the latest TV show?
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.200]   Are you a disciple of work?
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.480]   Or how about Disneyland?
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:36.240]   The trouble is not that we don't believe in Jesus Christ.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.800]   The problem is that we believe in Jesus Christ
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.720]   and something else.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.400]   It's kind of like the Hindus in India.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.880]   You know, I went to India, and we said, like,
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.440]   "Believe in Jesus Christ."
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.120]   And they believe in all these gods, right?
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.240]   They believe in all these different gods.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.360]   We say, "Believe in Jesus Christ."
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.560]   And they're like, "Okay."
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.720]   (audience laughs)
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.000]   Right?
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.360]   Because they believe that, you know,
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.080]   they could have as many gods as they want,
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.200]   as long as they could find a way to get to their place
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.240]   where they wanna go.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:12.240]   If you are a true disciple of Christ,
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.920]   your thoughts, your decisions, your actions
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.800]   should be solely for Christ.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.360]   And as a result, surprising to unbelievers.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.960]   It should be unexpected.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.880]   And it may be sometimes offensive to them.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.320]   And sometimes it may be attractive.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:36.160]   While I was in China, I was leading a Bible study.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.120]   And there were, at that time, there were about eight people.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.200]   It was a small group.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.000]   And that time, I was teaching them
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.520]   about what it is to be a follower of Christ,
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.560]   about counting the cost.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.400]   And I was teaching them that, you know, like,
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.040]   I'm so looking forward to meeting Christ.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.440]   I'm not afraid of death.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.480]   You know, I'm not.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.080]   And, you know, like, I was even telling them,
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.480]   I was like, you know, a long time ago,
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.600]   even before I was married, I used to tell people
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.600]   that if Christ came back, it's okay.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.320]   I don't have to get married before Christ comes back.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.160]   You know, some people are like,
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.600]   "God, please let me get married first
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.240]   "before you come back."
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.080]   Right?
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.760]   For me, it was like, I don't have to.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.320]   I'm so looking forward to seeing Jesus Christ.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.640]   But then, like, across from me,
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.840]   I remember there's this one girl.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.040]   There are college students there.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.560]   There's one girl, and she was like,
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.920]   every time she heard some of these comments,
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.760]   she was like.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.600]   Like, it was kind of distracting.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.680]   I had to look somewhere else while I was teaching.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.640]   These things that we learn from Jesus Christ
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.400]   are things that should be surprising to this world.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:54.260]   These things are things that we need to learn and obey.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:59.040]   And the question I wanna ask is,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.680]   whose disciple are you?
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.120]   Have you considered the cost?
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.080]   In Matthew chapter eight,
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.600]   it talks about considering the cost.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.960]   Jesus says, you might not have a place to sleep.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.160]   Jesus says, you might not be able to,
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.360]   you may need to forego your plans.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.840]   You may need to forego your plans
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.760]   about caring for your parents, even.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.860]   How are you as a disciple of Christ?
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.120]   Is your life filled with good deeds?
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.600]   In Matthew chapter five, it talks about that.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.480]   It says, are you causing people
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.620]   to praise God because of your good deeds?
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.540]   Is that you?
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:42.760]   Are you honest and genuine in your profession?
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.000]   Are you honest with your relationships?
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.040]   Are you honest with your family members?
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:54.160]   In Matthew five, it says, let your yes be yes.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.780]   Don't make fake promises.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.980]   In Matthew chapter six, it talks about prayer.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.640]   How genuine is your prayer?
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.700]   I know for me, for a long time, when I pray,
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.600]   especially before a meal, right,
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.760]   I pray the same exact prayer all the time.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.320]   But, you know, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.320]   My son does that, he prays the exact same prayer every time.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.880]   It's not necessarily a bad thing, but I'm asking,
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.560]   is your prayer genuine when you pray that prayer?
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:33.040]   In Matthew six, Jesus talks about,
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.440]   are you forgiving others?
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.000]   As a disciple of Christ, I think this is
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.880]   one of the hardest things, especially if you've had
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.080]   an experience in your past where someone
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.880]   has hurt you really bad.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.840]   Especially in the past if someone has like,
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.000]   especially if they're like your close friend
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.240]   and they backstabbed you in some way.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.000]   Or maybe your husband or your wife did something recently.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.440]   Or maybe it might be someone in the congregation.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.800]   You know, are you forgiving them?
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   'Cause Jesus Christ calls us to forgive them.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.640]   Are you willing to love your enemies?
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.320]   You know, is there someone in your past that,
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.680]   like every time you see them, you feel like awkward
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.320]   around them because of something that happened in the past?
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.600]   Are you willing to love them still?
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.200]   Are you willing to forgive them?
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.280]   What about money?
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.320]   As a disciple of Christ, are you a good steward
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.160]   of your money?
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.000]   Are you giving offering faithfully?
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.240]   Or what about overseas, we hear about children
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.280]   that are suffering.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.400]   And there are organizations that are working
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.360]   to see Christ preached to them.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.920]   Are you using your finances to live out your faith?
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.760]   Supporting those things as well.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.720]   How are you as a disciple of Christ?
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.080]   In Matthew chapter six also, Jesus Christ says,
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.120]   "Don't worry about your life."
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.080]   Do you worry?
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.200]   Do you worry about your future?
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.000]   Do you stress about things to the point
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.880]   that you become disabled?
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.560]   Are you constantly filled with fear about relationships?
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.160]   Are you fearful of the future?
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.400]   Are you fearful that someone might hurt you?
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.560]   Jesus Christ says, "Don't worry."
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.480]   How are you as his disciple?
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.480]   And are you willing to suffer for Christ?
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:34.600]   Jesus says, "All men will hate you."
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.200]   A lot of people will hate us as believers
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.320]   because of Jesus.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.960]   Take a look at your lives.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.960]   Are you a disciple of Christ?
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.680]   Or are you a disciple of Christ and something else?
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:27:00.560]   Not only are we called to be disciples ourselves,
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.240]   but we are also called to make disciples of Christ.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.160]   And it's not just through Bible studies.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.160]   Again, it is primarily done through,
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.760]   the teaching of God's word is done
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.320]   through the messages on Sundays.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.760]   And we get to learn through Bible studies.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:20.200]   But making disciples is not only done through this.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:25.960]   It's also done through our actions.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.640]   Our actions, our reactions, will teach
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.040]   and will be examples for others
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:37.040]   how to act and react in any given situation as a believer.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:41.280]   An easy way to think about this,
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.320]   about how we might affect other people,
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.760]   how we might influence other people.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.520]   An easy way to think about this is
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.760]   when we think about children.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.640]   My son, Timothy,
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:56.720]   he loves to copy what I do.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.960]   And my daughter, Claire, who's only one,
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.880]   she's also beginning to copy us.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.000]   And for example, there was one night,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.800]   my daughter, Claire, I was sitting with my daughter,
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.640]   and then also my mom was there, her grandmother.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.360]   And my mom, she just, you know, she yawned.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.440]   She was like, (gasps)
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.680]   right?
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.720]   And then my daughter, she saw that, she's only one,
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.040]   and she goes, (gasps)
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:25.960]   (laughs)
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.200]   And she doesn't know what she's doing,
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.040]   but then she's copying.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:34.080]   You know, all of us, we are all, in some ways,
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.240]   products of what we surround ourselves with,
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.080]   or what we have been surrounded by.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.880]   Our families influence us a lot.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.600]   You know, you could tell by, if you look at siblings,
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.120]   sometimes they laugh exactly the same way, right?
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:55.120]   Our parents, you know, they've taught us how to laugh,
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.360]   how to talk, how to walk, how to eat,
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:03.360]   what table manners are, and kids imitate their parents.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.440]   Anything and everything that we are
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.720]   has been a result of influence by others.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.000]   And so, we are able to do the same for others.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.760]   We are able to be an example in that way to others,
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.760]   and in this way, we are also making disciples.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.760]   So through your actions, I'm asking you today,
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.680]   the second application question is,
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.320]   how are you teaching people to obey Christ?
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:40.800]   How are you, as one who makes disciples of Christ,
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.560]   what are you teaching, even just through your actions,
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.360]   or maybe through your words as well?
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.720]   What are you teaching others?
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.680]   How are you making disciples of others?
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.480]   How are, what are you teaching to your coworkers
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.120]   about what a Christian is about?
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.320]   You know, I worked for three years
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.520]   before I went into the seminary,
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.400]   and during that time, like I know,
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.840]   it's easy to cut corners.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.400]   It's easy to try to get your way out of a project.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:15.920]   How are you as a disciple of Christ before them?
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.280]   What are you teaching them?
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.800]   What about in your family?
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.440]   What are you teaching your brother or your sister?
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.200]   How about your parents?
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.040]   What are you teaching your children?
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   I mean, especially when I think about my son,
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:35.040]   there are times that my handsome son
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:40.120]   can be a little brat, right?
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.840]   And I have to discipline him.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.600]   But then every time I discipline him,
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.040]   the way that I do it, he's gonna learn
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.760]   that's what discipline is about,
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.960]   and he may grow up to do the exact same thing.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.680]   What am I teaching to my children?
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.840]   (silence)
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:01.000]   How are you making disciples
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.320]   of your fellow church members,
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.640]   your brothers and sisters?
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:10.560]   There's one thing that I noticed
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.840]   that has changed over the past five years.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.560]   You know, I was gone for five years, and I came back,
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.600]   and I was really surprised to see
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.200]   how people's views have changed on same-sex marriage.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.360]   Just their views on homosexuality.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.120]   If we think about maybe five years ago before I left,
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.640]   or even 10 years ago, I remember that the state
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.140]   of California, we voted twice against same-sex marriage.
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.160]   Maybe three times, I don't remember,
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.080]   but I know at least for sure, two times,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.120]   we voted against it.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:46.120]   This Democrat state voted against same-sex marriage twice.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:51.520]   But now today, what do I find?
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.280]   I come back and I find that people think
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.880]   that same-sex marriage is okay,
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.700]   or at least don't care about it.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.000]   Just kind of thinking, oh, you know,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.200]   that's what they do, but you know, whatever.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.480]   And then when we find, you know, like some churches,
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:11.120]   like the PCUSA, they decided that they would recognize
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.360]   same-sex marriage.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:19.440]   How are we making disciples of Christ
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.740]   with this kind of mindset?
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:28.300]   How are we making disciples of Christ?
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:32.240]   What's important to you?
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.440]   What are the things that you talk about
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.600]   all the time to people?
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.440]   Is it sports?
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.560]   I mean, I bring this up over and over
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.400]   because I know people talk about it a lot.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.620]   Is it sports that you talk about all the time?
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.000]   Well, what do you talk about?
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.520]   Is it complaints about your work or your family?
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.720]   What do you talk about all the time?
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.020]   Is it the worries of your life about finances
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.680]   or your future or your kid's future?
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.920]   What is it that you're always talking about?
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:08.080]   What are your reactions to people that fight each other?
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.880]   These are, I saw on the news recently
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:16.480]   that there are these two ladies in some store,
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.840]   and they got into it.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.000]   They got into a fight.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.140]   And it was surprising.
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.120]   One of the ladies, she was actually in one of those,
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.800]   I don't know what it's called, the ee.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.640]   What is that called?
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.460]   I don't know what it's called.
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.600]   It's like a mobile wheelchair, I don't know.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.240]   And she actually got up
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.040]   and started fighting this other lady.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:41.480]   And then one of the ladies actually had a son with her,
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.480]   and then the son wasn't like, oh.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.960]   The son was grabbing a shampoo bottle
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.160]   and cracking it on the other lady's head,
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.720]   and the kid was like, yeah, yeah, get 'em, Mom.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:34:00.000]   As Christians, if we saw that, what would we do?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.700]   Is that okay?
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.720]   I mean, we're called to be peacemakers, right?
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.620]   What would we do?
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.860]   I mean, I thought it was only happening in China,
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.180]   but it happens here also.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.400]   You know when people fight or something happens?
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.560]   People pull out their cell phones
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.920]   and they start taking pictures instead of helping them.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:25.260]   How are you making disciples?
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.880]   What are the things that you show to the people around you
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.220]   about what a disciple of Christ is?
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:34.700]   I mean, what's okay with you?
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:38.660]   What's, I mean, it's like, you know,
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.720]   I know, I know, some Christians,
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.480]   they might kinda not like this kinda stuff,
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.960]   but it's okay with me, you know, it's okay.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.840]   What's okay with you?
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.560]   Or maybe what's not okay with you?
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:56.140]   How are you as a disciple maker of Christ?
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:35:00.820]   Everything that you say and do can carry a message
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:05.440]   to people around you as to what a follower of Christ is.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.760]   And it may be a correct message,
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.680]   and it may be an incorrect message,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.560]   but in the end, you are representing Christ as his follower
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.400]   and teaching others what a follower of Christ looks like.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:24.900]   So again, how are you as a maker of disciples?
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:31.080]   Now, when I think about this idea
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.980]   about how I need to be a disciple myself
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.560]   and how I need to make disciples of others,
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.560]   and I think about my life
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.480]   and just how I carry myself every day.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.560]   I mean, it's such a huge burden.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.240]   I mean, again, like my example about discipling,
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.900]   I mean, not discipling, disciplining my son,
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:56.600]   there's like a fine line between like, you know,
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.560]   don't do that, don't do, being firm,
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.960]   and fits of rage, like, I told you not to do that, right?
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.080]   There's this fine line there,
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.080]   and it's something that all of us
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.480]   need to be thinking about.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.480]   This responsibility, this,
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.760]   man, it's such a huge burden, almost.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.960]   And when I think about it, for me personally,
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.880]   it could be very intimidating.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:25.600]   Now, I just wanna express to you guys
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   that I'm not saying that I know how to do this perfectly.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.080]   I'm not saying that I'm a disciple of Christ
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.080]   and I got it all together.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.080]   I still struggle.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.480]   I struggle as a person.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.440]   I struggle as a parent.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.760]   I struggle to be a good husband.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.880]   I struggle to be a good pastor, or even just a witness.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.280]   I struggle still.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.000]   And I need, as much as you guys,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.880]   I need mature believers around me to help me as well,
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.800]   to be examples for me as well.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:59.760]   Because I'm not sure that I'm representing Christ
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.720]   in the right way, to my coworkers, to my family,
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.520]   to my wife, to my children.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.460]   I'm not sure that I'm representing Christ in the right way.
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.660]   And the thing is that God calls us,
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.980]   Jesus Christ calls us to be perfect.
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:19.580]   And I realize that I utterly fail.
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:27.100]   I constantly, constantly fail.
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.060]   Not only do I fail in my actions in front of people,
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:34.700]   but I fail even in my own heart to be pure and holy.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.420]   I fail to be a disciple of Christ myself.
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:43.660]   But then that's where the last sentence is so important
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.300]   in our passage today.
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.780]   It's a promise to us that Jesus gives to us.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:53.020]   Jesus says, "Surely I'm with you always
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.900]   "to the very end of the age."
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:59.940]   And Jesus, as he's saying this,
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.260]   you can kind of imagine what he's saying.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.980]   He's saying, "Look, remember, I'm the king.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.620]   "All authority in heaven and on earth
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.980]   "has been given to me."
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.940]   Why?
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:14.260]   Because I conquered sin, I conquered death.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:18.380]   I already paid the price so that you might live.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.100]   I have paid the price for all your errors.
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:21.980]   And you know what?
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:25.260]   All your sins in the future, I paid for them also.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.940]   Whatever mistakes that you're gonna make,
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.060]   whatever errors you make, I paid for them also.
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.460]   I already died for you.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.100]   I will not reject you.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:43.180]   I am always with you, even to the end of the age.
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.100]   That's what Jesus Christ says.
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:52.100]   You see, in the end, what we see is that being a disciple
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.820]   is about understanding and accepting his grace
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:01.020]   that came about only through the painful
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.300]   and brutal sacrifice of the lamb.
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:09.300]   Making disciples then is about portraying
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:14.660]   our response to grace and causing others as well
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:18.100]   to respond to such amazing grace,
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.700]   whether it be to non-believers or to believers.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:28.700]   I desire to do this wherever God leads me,
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.980]   whether here or in China.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.420]   May we all as individuals and as a church
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.140]   hear the call of the Great Commission
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.260]   and make disciples wherever we are.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.180]   Let's pray.
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:53.940]   Father God, I thank you so much for your amazing grace.
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.420]   I thank you so much for your love.
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:00.060]   But even as we call ourselves disciples of Christ,
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.020]   there are many times that we still fail.
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.260]   But I thank you so much that the work on the cross
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.700]   is finished and that we're able
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.440]   to come before you confidently.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:14.940]   And so Lord, I pray for my brothers and sisters here as well
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.700]   would you be working in their lives,
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.580]   in their hearts, in their minds.
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:23.660]   And Lord, may they be people that make disciples of yours.
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:28.660]   And I pray Lord that even when we fail,
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.540]   'cause there are times, a lot of times that we fail,
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.180]   Lord would you remind us of your amazing grace
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:37.420]   and help us Lord in response to your grace
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.640]   to continue to live for you.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.400]   I thank you dear Lord and I pray these things
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.460]   in Jesus Christ's name, amen.
