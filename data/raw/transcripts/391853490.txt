[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.360]   If you could turn your Bibles with me, let me read again Matthew 22 starting from verse
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.160]   37 down to 40 before we jump into the text again.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.880]   Again, I'm going to be spending today and then one more week next week before we jump
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.640]   back into Hebrews chapter 7.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.640]   And I want to make sure that we're on the same page as to what we are emphasizing and
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.960]   where we're headed in the church in 2020.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.360]   And so to know him and to make him known is our theme.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.840]   So we spent last week talking about loving God and today is part two of that.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.960]   And then next week we're going to be talking about making him known and what does that
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.960]   mean for our church.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.160]   And so again, it's a semi-topical sermon that we'll be having until we jump back into Hebrews
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.160]   7.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.920]   All right, so let me read from starting from verse 36.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.560]   "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?"
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.240]   And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.880]   your soul and with all your mind."
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.800]   And this is the great and foremost commandment.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.560]   "The second is like it, you shall love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.840]   On these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.760]   Let's pray.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:21.000]   Father, you truly are worthy of all our worship, our attention, our finances, our whole life.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.120]   Help us to deepen in our understanding of what it is that we profess.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.920]   That our life, our thoughts, our emotions may all be consistent with what we profess
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.120]   to believe.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.120]   Help us to understand and apply this commandment to love you with all our heart, soul, mind,
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.160]   and strength.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.200]   Help us, Lord God, as a church collectively that our fellowship will be known as people
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.760]   who genuinely love you.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.400]   So we pray for your grace this morning.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.240]   Let the word go forth, let it not return until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.440]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.200]   All right, I'm going to be talking about Kobe and Shaq this morning.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.080]   I promise today is the last day that I will talk about Kobe.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.880]   And they're going to have a memorial for him and his family and all the people who passed
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.240]   away on the 24th.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.360]   But I thought it was appropriate, again, not to honor Kobe, okay?
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.640]   Just that clearly what happened has been on many people's mind for a while.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.520]   But I wanted to kind of set things straight because there's been a lot of talk because,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.440]   you know, I'm sure almost every other video that you've watched in the last two to three
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.200]   weeks or longer have been about tribute to Kobe, about stories about Kobe and all this
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   stuff.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.520]   And one of the things that keeps circulating is about the rift between Kobe and Shaq.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.200]   And clearly there's plenty of evidence, and those of you who are a little bit older, you
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.080]   remember the rift that they had and then, you know, Lakers chose to go with Kobe rather
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.360]   than Shaq.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.600]   But those of you who watched Lakers during that time know that it was more than just
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.000]   a personal rift between Shaq and Kobe.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.960]   Prior to Shaq leaving the Lakers, they won three championships, 2000, 2001, 2003.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.800]   So they had a three-peat.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.000]   And so Shaq clearly was the most dominant player in all of the league.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.240]   And so Kobe was an up-and-coming star and Shaq was the one who was dominant.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.920]   But after he won the third championship, starting from 2004, again, some of you guys may not
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.300]   remember this, those of you guys who are a little bit older may remember, it was so frustrating
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.680]   watching Shaq play.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.880]   Because he played like somebody who'd already achieved the peak.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.080]   And he wasn't running down, and I remember watching him, again, and I wasn't a huge Lakers
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.520]   fan at that time because once Magic stopped playing, I just kind of lost interest.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.960]   And Kobe was just too cocky.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.880]   And Shaq came from another team, so it was hard for me to get attached.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.240]   But it was hard to watch Shaq because Shaq's such a big guy and the opposing team would
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.840]   run by him and use him as a pick.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.920]   And then Shaq would not go out.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.320]   So he actually became a liability on the team, so clearly Shaq was not playing like he was
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.280]   going to win a championship.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.980]   Shaq played like he won three championships, he had nothing more to prove.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.160]   And then on the other side, Kobe, even though he won three championships, he was an up-and-coming
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.760]   star, they always said, well, Kobe won because he was on a great team.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.440]   So Kobe wanted to prove that he was that guy.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.300]   He's the next Michael Jordan, or he's going to surpass Michael Jordan.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.980]   But here's this superstar who's actually getting in the way, right?
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.120]   So some of you guys may remember, may not remember, that had a lot to do with the Rift
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:46.040]   because Kobe was frustrated that he was playing with such a dominant superstar who just didn't
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.120]   seem like he had anything to prove, where Kobe was just coming up.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.240]   And that's why when he won the championship later on, the two championships, a lot of
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.680]   that had to do with him proving himself, that it wasn't just Shaq, that he was a superstar
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.040]   independent of Shaq.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.160]   Now why do I say all of this?
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.320]   This is how I'm going to link this to the sermon, okay?
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.880]   Shaq got to the peak, or he thought he got to the peak, and he had nothing more to prove,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.600]   so he was just enjoying himself.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.160]   And Shaq was clearly the nicer guy.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.640]   He was the one making everybody laugh, he was the one who was generous, and there's
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.200]   just stories about him buying people's cars and all this stuff.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.820]   And yet, when he came to basketball, it was just something that, kind of like, he's done
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.080]   everything he needed to do, and he's just going to ride this out.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:43.160]   Now I say all of this because our Christian lives, oftentimes, look a lot more like Shaq.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.320]   You know, we think of our justification.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.060]   Since our sins have been justified, from the moment we are justified until we are glorified,
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.280]   we just kind of ride out our sanctification.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.160]   Because we're constantly reminded, we've arrived.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.040]   He's already accomplished the work, and so we have nothing to prove, we can't earn our
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:08.120]   salvation, so we're just going to get on this boat and just ride this out.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:16.200]   When this question came up to Jesus, you know, like, should we offer these coins to Caesar?
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.440]   You know, obviously we talked about that last week, that was a source of contention.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.800]   If we offer it up to Rome, they're going to use it for pagan purposes.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.560]   So Jesus, in his genius, between these two rivals, between the Pharisees and the Herodians,
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.740]   he says, "Well, render to Caesar what is Caesar's, render to God what is God's."
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.160]   So we know what it means to render to Caesar's because Caesar's face was on the coin.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.920]   But what is he talking about to render to God, then?
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:50.600]   See, what he says there is connected to the passage that we just read in Matthew 22, 37.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:58.080]   Because there was a tendency among the Pharisees to get caught up in, "Is it okay to pay taxes?
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.120]   Can we travel this far on the Sabbath?
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.360]   Are we allowed to do this or to do that?
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.360]   Can we eat this?
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.740]   Can we go into Samaria and not be defiled?"
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.980]   And they were so concerned about keeping the law, thinking that somehow that that was going
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.000]   to make them righteous and get them closer to God.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.120]   But what Jesus was saying to the Pharisees and the Herodians, "Your focus is on the wrong
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.120]   thing.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.780]   That belongs to Caesar, so give it to him.
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.160]   But what God desires from you is much more than those coins."
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.720]   You see, you have to read this text all together, and not just read the text that we just read
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.760]   this morning.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:43.040]   The two other questions that he answers sets up for this.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.720]   Where he says, "What God really desires from us is you shall love the Lord your God with
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.200]   all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind."
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.280]   It wasn't just simply the coins, paying the taxes, coming to church.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:06.000]   You and I know you can come to church all your life because out of habit, out of superstition,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.680]   because this is your social center, because of football, so football season, the softball
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.280]   season's coming, the basketball season's coming.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.280]   So we can come to church for all kinds of reasons, and we can feel confident that we've
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.600]   just decided to get on the right boat, and we're just coasting along.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.520]   But what Jesus is trying to indict the nation of Israel is that you think that if you just
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.880]   check off these boxes that somehow that you're going to be safe.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.040]   He said, "No, what God is looking for are people who will worship him in spirit and
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.200]   in truth, true worshipers."
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.000]   Not people who are just checking off the boxes.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.440]   That's why Ephesians chapter five, that's a passage that you hear a lot at weddings,
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.160]   between a husband and wife, and how husband ought to love his wife like Christ loved the
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.200]   church sacrificially, and how the wife is a submit to the husband as the church does
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.200]   to Christ.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.160]   He gave a beautiful sermon about that beautiful passage, but he concludes that passage saying,
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.480]   "But I'm not really talking about marriage."
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.520]   He concludes that passage, "I'm telling you this because I'm trying to show you the relationship
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.160]   that Christ has with his church."
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:24.360]   And it is deliberate that God chooses the most intimate human relationship to describe
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.400]   his relationship with the church.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.920]   That he didn't just purchase the church and said, "You know what?
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.920]   You're free.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920]   Go to hell.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.920]   I'll see you in heaven."
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.440]   That's not how he describes our relationship.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.320]   He describes our relationship between a husband and wife.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.200]   A love, intimate relationship, a covenant relationship.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.600]   And that's what he is talking about.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.680]   He says, "This is what God is looking for."
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.800]   Think about it.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.480]   What reward does God have for our salvation?
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.400]   What does he get out of this?
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.600]   Some people say, "Oh, he was lonely."
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   God was lonely.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.600]   He wasn't lonely.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.600]   He's part of the trinity.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.880]   There's perfect union between the Godhead.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:15.320]   We didn't somehow fulfill a need of his that he didn't have within himself.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.920]   That would be blasphemy.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.760]   What does he get from our salvation?
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.560]   I mean, he needed us to spread the gospel?
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.720]   I think God would do a much better job if he just opened the heavens and just talked
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.880]   himself.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.400]   If he just said, "I'm real."
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.160]   That's it.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.400]   We get in the way.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.840]   It's mind boggling why he even engages us.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.000]   What does he get from our salvation?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.720]   The only thing that I can think of and the only thing that the Bible, to me, reveals
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.360]   is worship.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.240]   That's unique to me and unique to you.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.600]   It's unique to each church.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.520]   When the Bible says that God desires from us before evangelization of the world, before
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.120]   practice of this and establishment of the church, what he desires more than anything
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.600]   else is love.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:27.240]   Again, it's another way of saying worship, true worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.920]   Now what does this have to do with our theme for this year?
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.360]   The theme for this year is to know him and to make him known.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.320]   One of the questions I asked on Facebook is what is the correlation between loving him
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.520]   and knowing him?
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:45.920]   Well, in John chapter 17, three to six, Jesus' high priestly prayer, he says, "This is eternal
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.600]   life.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.920]   This is eternal life, that they may know you."
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.240]   Eternal life, he doesn't say this is eternal life that you save them from punishment, which
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.240]   is also true.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.520]   He said, "This is eternal life that they are not condemned and not go to hell," which is
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:07.960]   also true, "but in his priestly prayer, which he deliberately prayed so that others may
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:16.820]   hear and so that he may be recorded in eternity to make it absolutely crystal clear.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:25.960]   This is eternal life that they may know you to have this covenant relationship with you
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.880]   and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.840]   I glorified you on earth."
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.760]   Let me stop right there.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.240]   What was the purpose of glorifying Jesus?
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.880]   Because without knowing him, without seeing him, how can you worship him?
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.880]   How can you love him?
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.320]   How can you follow him?
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:51.200]   The whole purpose of Jesus' incarnation, he says, was to glorify him so that when we see
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.980]   Christ, what do we see?
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:54.980]   We see God himself.
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:00.060]   Remember the disciples as they were going to Jerusalem, he said, "Let me just see God.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.060]   Can you just see as God?"
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.980]   And Jesus says, "How long have I been with you?
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:08.240]   I've been telling you, if you have seen me, you have seen the Father."
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.460]   His whole purpose of going to the cross was to glorify the Father and the Father to glorify
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.160]   the Son.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.840]   Having accomplished the work which you have given me to do, now, Father, glorify me together
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.960]   with yourself and with the glory which I had with you before the world was.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.560]   I have manifested your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.780]   They were yours and you gave them to me and they have kept your word.
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:39.960]   So the whole purpose of Christ's incarnation, death, and resurrection is described in these
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.880]   few verses.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.600]   For the purpose of opening your eyes to see God.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:54.560]   And by seeing God, that those who believe may have this covenant relationship with him.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.440]   So how is this connected to our theme?
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.880]   You cannot love a God that you do not know.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.620]   You cannot love a God that you do not know.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.780]   So this morning, I want to give four biblical principles of what the Bible teaches us about
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.160]   knowing God and how this ultimately relates to loving God.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:24.480]   So number one, knowing God is the central pursuit of every Christian.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:30.080]   When he says, "This is eternal life that they may know you," it is not simply in the past
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.040]   tense.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.960]   You don't get married to somebody and then have a ceremony and then you go your own way.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.160]   The whole purpose of why you have the ceremony when you get married is so that you can live
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.000]   together.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.640]   Nobody has a ceremony and then finds two apartments or two houses and live separately.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.960]   Why would you have a ceremony?
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:56.480]   The whole purpose of justification is to continue to unite us to Christ.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.320]   So when he says that they may know you, he's not talking about so that they may have an
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.800]   encounter with you and then just enjoy themselves.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:12.960]   Christian is to know him, is to be married with him, that we become his bride and him
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.280]   our groom.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:23.800]   So our primary pursuit of every Christian is to pursue God, pursue Christ.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.880]   But the problem with us, and part of the reason why there's so much superficial love for Christ
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.840]   is because the pursuit oftentimes stops early.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.600]   When you first become a Christian, it's always encouraging when you're around brand new Christians
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.280]   because they have some of the best questions.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.320]   Do I have to dress up?
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.640]   I've had people come up to the front because we ran out of room in second service and ask
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.280]   me, "Is it okay if I sit here?"
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.720]   Nobody who's been a Christian for a while would ever ask that question.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.080]   But a brand new Christian is so eager to do it right.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.960]   Can I come to this?
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   Can I do this?
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.400]   Of course, we're trying so hard to get them to come.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.560]   And they're asking permission if they can come.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:19.880]   But at some point in our walk with God, we become a shack.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.240]   You're not defending anymore.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.640]   You're getting in the way.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:32.560]   The opposing team is using you as a pick.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.600]   Let me give you a simple illustration.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:45.880]   We know how often we get scam emails, often from some foreign country, Nigeria or somewhere.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:51.580]   And they'll give you this long story saying they're the son of some king or some prince
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.680]   and he has to take some money out because the government is corrupt.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.400]   And he has a million dollars that he needs to send over.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:04.200]   And if you would just deposit $3,000 to make all the transactions and pay the fees, I will
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.600]   transfer it over and I'll give you a portion of that.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.560]   How many of you have ever fallen for that?
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:18.840]   If you have, you're probably not going to admit it.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.240]   All of us, we know enough when we read that thing, it's like, "This is too good to be
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.800]   true."
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.640]   So if it's too good to be true, what do you normally do?
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.040]   You ignore it.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.520]   Or what if it is true?
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.520]   What if?
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:43.120]   I mean, it sounds too good to be true, but what if it is true?
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.520]   But that's a lot of money that you have to deposit.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.780]   I don't want to get scammed.
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:47.780]   So what do you do?
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.160]   You do your research.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.860]   You ask your friends.
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.080]   You copy that email.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.200]   You send it to other people.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.520]   Have you gotten this email?
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:18:00.200]   And make sure that it clears, that it seems like it's legit.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.480]   Let me give you another illustration.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.760]   A couple years ago, when we came into this building, we got contacted from this air conditioning
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:16.080]   company and they said that they have this program where they will replace all of our
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:22.040]   old air conditioning and they would add to our new air conditioning and it would save
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:27.480]   us, basically cut our electric bill by two-thirds.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.440]   So we're paying like $3,000 a month for electric bill and stuff and it's going to save us $2,000
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.080]   a month and all of that was for free.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.400]   And it wasn't going to cost us anything.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.360]   And they said all these air conditionings, we know how much it costs for us to put these
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.680]   in and we didn't replace the old ones on the other side, but to do that would have cost
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.200]   hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   So we waited and they said, well, it's going to cost, the actual cost of it with the labor
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.680]   would have been about $230,000 and we asked them, what do we have to pay?
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.680]   And they said zero.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:07.920]   Well, that sounds like a Nigerian email.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.400]   And so we initially were like, no way.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.560]   No way.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.200]   So we ignored it.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.200]   Got another email.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.080]   Hey, did you guys get this?
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.320]   And then we got another mail and then they came and they said, hey, can we make an appointment?
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.040]   And so we started getting curious because they were relentless.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.040]   We got some email, they came, we talked to them and even after we talked to them, they
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.920]   gave these fancy brochures and left it at the table.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.620]   We researched it, looked into it.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.200]   We pass it on to our elders so that they could look into it.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.980]   And then we sat on it because we couldn't believe it.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.600]   Why would they just do this for free?
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:49.280]   So we sat on that for almost a year with them pursuing us.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.840]   Hey, this is real.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.160]   You can have this for free.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.880]   We have other churches in the neighborhood that they've done it.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.800]   So we called them.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.040]   Hey, is this legit?
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.120]   We had Elder Joe call Southern California Edison.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.200]   Hey, we got this from this company.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.160]   Is this legit?
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.920]   And so slowly we started realizing, hey, these guys are scared.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.120]   They did a really good job.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:28.760]   Because they got somebody at Southern California Edison picking up the phone for them.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:37.040]   And so reluctantly and carefully, we decided to open the door and allow them to come and
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.360]   then we'll do incrementally.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.200]   We'll give them a little bit of money to see what they do.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.680]   And hold on, they were here up on the roof taking things down.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.880]   And even then we're coming in and I would ask Pastor Mark, are they up there?
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.720]   He said, yes.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   Oh.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.240]   Did they give you a bill?
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.240]   He's like, no.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.800]   So we just walked out and I'm doing my study.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.360]   It's like, this makes no sense.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.500]   Why would they do this for free?
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.440]   So they finished the whole thing.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.840]   $200,000 worth of work.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.120]   All brand new air conditioners on that side.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.000]   And there was maybe two or three that wasn't covered so we ended up paying maybe about
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.600]   $20,000 for the ones.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.960]   We asked them, while you're up there, can you just change this too?
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:28.120]   But basically we had over $200,000 of air conditioning work done for free.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:34.920]   And just like they said, our electric bill dropped by more than half.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:40.440]   And even now I'm thinking, after a whole year, are we going to get a bill at some point?
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.880]   Because it's too good to be true.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.200]   But it was actually true.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:51.280]   So they somehow had convinced the Southern California Edison and the California, they're
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.120]   very careful about saving the planet and all this stuff.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:01.640]   So they somehow convinced California to flip the bill for churches like ours so that they
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:07.080]   can reduce the electricity even if they had to pay $200,000 out of their pocket.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.460]   This was something going on with California.
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:17.240]   And even now, somebody just gave us $200,000.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.320]   Now I say all of this.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:27.080]   Let me tell you something even more hard to believe.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:36.240]   John 3.16, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son."
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:44.520]   That should have stopped us right there already.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:56.360]   One God, God, God of the universe, who wiped out the whole world because he was angry because
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:02.160]   over the sins, that God, he didn't just pay attention, he didn't just call our name, he
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.080]   gave his only, only begotten son.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.360]   I mean, are you serious?
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:17.600]   I have a hard time believing the $200,000 air conditioning on our roof.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.920]   God gave his only begotten son?
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.640]   How do I meet this God?
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.320]   How do I know this God?
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:33.080]   Whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:39.960]   So the only cost for me to meet this God and to be saved from eternal damnation is just
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.200]   to say that I believe.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.920]   Come on.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.040]   Come on.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.840]   That's not where it stops.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:56.440]   Romans 5, "But God demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners,
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.640]   Christ died for us."
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.640]   We weren't neutral.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.120]   We weren't good people.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.640]   We were blaspheming his name when he did this.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.960]   Come on.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.280]   You got a phone call from Michael Jordan or Shaq or the president and he's like, "You
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.280]   wouldn't believe it.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.280]   Why would he call me?
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:19.160]   What does he have to gain from calling me?"
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:27.360]   This is God of the universe who gave his only begotten son while you and I were blaspheming
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.460]   his name.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:38.200]   We heard this message and so many of us said, "Okay.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.920]   I believe."
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.440]   If you actually believe that, just come down the aisle.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.440]   So, "Okay."
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.440]   We come down.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.720]   Then we did some prayers and we went back.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.520]   "No more damnation."
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:56.640]   Ephesians 4 and 5, 1, 4, and 5, "In love, he predestined us to adoption as sons through
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.840]   Jesus Christ according to the kind intentions of his will."
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.680]   Not only did he save us while we were blaspheming, he didn't just prevent us from going to hell.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   He lifted us up so that we can call him Abba Father.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.680]   We're adopted children.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.320]   We're co-heirs with Christ.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.280]   And you believe this?
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.360]   You've accepted this?
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.640]   You get a mail from Nigeria and you just take it to the trash can because it's too good
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.000]   to be true.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:36.360]   And yet, in Christianity, we hear this fullest message of the cross and we gave it no other
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.720]   thought other than, "Okay.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.200]   I'll take it."
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:49.600]   And it's the superficial, shallow way that we receive this gospel that is reflected in
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.080]   the way that we live.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:26:03.640]   If we ever have given a minute's thought to what we sing and what we profess, it is beyond
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.080]   belief what it is that we sing.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:16.280]   You see, the Bible calls the gospel the mystery of Christ.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.360]   It's a mystery.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.080]   And you know, there's all kinds of mysteries, right?
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.080]   You lose your key.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.080]   It's a mystery.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.080]   I forgot where I put it.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.520]   You go to watch a movie, it's a mystery.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.940]   You're entertained.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:34.600]   But the mystery of the cross is the mystery above all mysteries because it is a puzzle
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.480]   that we have accepted but it's hard to comprehend.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.480]   We believe it.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.280]   He made it as plain as he could possibly make it.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.760]   And yet, the more we study it, the more we look at it, the more perplexing it is.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.920]   Why would he do this?
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:59.040]   So the whole Bible is a revelation of this mystery.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:07.360]   We ask this arrogant question, why would he condemn the world if he is so loving?
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.000]   It is such a foolish question.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.720]   Why wouldn't he?
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:18.840]   If a robber came into your house and you picked up a gun and shot him and he died, the legal
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.520]   system will say you are justified.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.520]   People will think you're foolish.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:29.120]   He came in with a gun trying to murder your family and you sat there and you did nothing
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.920]   while you had everything in your power to stop it and you did not do it.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   They'll say you're foolish.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:41.880]   They're not going to say, "Why weren't you gracious and let him rob you?"
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.200]   Why wouldn't he crush a world that is in rebellion against him?
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:52.340]   Why wouldn't he crush people who are blaspheming his name, dragging his name through the mud?
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:58.400]   So that's a completely arrogant question of human beings who have an inflated view of
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:05.220]   themselves because they don't know this God.
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:10.360]   The whole purpose of the Bible is to reveal that mystery.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:16.720]   And when that mystery is revealed for us to continue to know him, who is this God that
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   he would do this?
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.680]   Why would he do this?
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.920]   In what manner did he do this?
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.840]   How did he do this?
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.840]   What does he get from this?
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.780]   Where do we go because of this?
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.160]   What does it mean for me to call him Abba Father?
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.920]   What does it mean for me to say I'm co-heirs with Christ?
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.360]   What does it mean to have fellowship with him?
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.600]   What does it mean to love him?
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:45.880]   So the revelation of all of scripture is to give us a glimpse of this mystery and cause
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:50.440]   us to come to him.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.440]   In Colossians 2.2 it says that their hearts may be encouraged having been knit together
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:58.640]   in love and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.440]   resulting in the true knowledge of God's mystery.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:08.800]   True knowledge of God's mystery, that is Christ himself.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.180]   Christ is a glimpse of a revelation of that mystery.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:20.680]   The more you dig, the more mystery that you understand, the more you realize how far we
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.240]   are.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:31.060]   We have become so easily satisfied with our justification.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:36.460]   How many of us are still pursuing Christ?
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:42.680]   It is our superficial acceptance of this knowledge of the cross that results in a superficial
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.740]   worship of this God.
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:51.380]   First Peter 1.10-12 it says as to this salvation the prophets who prophesied of the grace that
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.500]   would come to you made careful searches and inquiries.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.500]   Did you hear that?
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:04.500]   When the coming Christ was revealed to the Old Testament prophets, when they heard it,
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.980]   they said they made careful inquiries.
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.300]   In other words, they were digging.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:16.480]   Who is this that's going to come to take away the sins of the world?
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.480]   What is he going to do?
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.920]   What does this atonement mean?
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:26.680]   So they, even as they were prophesying, even as they were speaking on God's behalf, they
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:32.640]   themselves were attracted to this mystery, asking questions, seeking to know what person
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.960]   or time the spirit of Christ within them was indicating as he predicted the suffering of
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.720]   Christ and the glories to follow.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.500]   Can you imagine that?
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:46.980]   The prophets were prophesying that Christ, you know what Christ means, Messiah, the King,
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.200]   the Savior.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.560]   And they were prophesying that this King, immediately when you think of King, you think
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.480]   of throne, you think of power, you think of sovereignty, and yet the prophets were prophesying
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.180]   that they were going to suffer.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.620]   What is that?
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.840]   Why would the King suffer?
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:09.000]   That's why the prophets were seeking carefully, who is this?
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.600]   What is he doing?
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.160]   And it was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.620]   In these things which now have been announced to you through those who preach the gospel
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:29.700]   to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.280]   It wasn't just the prophets.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.800]   Even the angels, when they were delivering this message, as they were delivering this,
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.600]   what is this?
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.040]   Why would the God of the universe who created me, who created you, send as the only begotten
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:51.440]   Son to deliver us, blaspheming his name, so that we can become co-heirs with Christ, calling
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.440]   him Abba Father?
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.520]   What is this?
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:03.920]   And yet, the way the gospel is preached, the way it is received, the way it is practiced,
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:12.040]   all points to maybe that we never really believed.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:17.640]   Or we had such shallow understanding of it.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.280]   We were just satisfied that we got on the boat and that was it.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.600]   Never really asking.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.160]   Why would he do this?
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:33.080]   See, again in Philippians 3, 7 through 11, I'm not going to read the whole passage, but
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:40.200]   Paul describes all that he had gained as a Jew, as a Pharisee, possibly a member of the
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.600]   Sanhedrin, the Senate.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.120]   He said, "Whatever things were gained to me," and Paul had a lot to gain.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.080]   He was a wealthy man with a Roman citizenship.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:55.600]   He was a direct disciple of the top scholar of that time, Gamaliel, a Pharisee among Pharisees.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.680]   There's a reason why when they killed Stephen, they took all their cloaks and put it on Paul's
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.200]   feet because Paul was a man of authority.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.680]   By doing that, Paul was taking responsibility.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:13.240]   So Paul was a man who had much authority already.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:18.640]   "Everything that was counted to me as lost for the sake of Christ.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:24.400]   More than that, I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.400]   Christ Jesus my Lord."
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:35.000]   See, the only reason why anybody would pick up their cross, as Jesus said, is because
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.680]   we want to follow Christ.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:44.760]   What is it about Christ that we would be willing to pick up our cross?
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.040]   Who is he?
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.440]   What is he?
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:59.760]   If we are not in love with Christ, if we are not attracted to the mystery of Christ, the
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:05.440]   cross is just a torture, a place of humiliation.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.040]   That's all it is.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:17.240]   But when Christ is the reason why we pick up our cross, the cross is an avenue of salvation.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.640]   Cross is the door that we take to know this Savior.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:28.400]   That's why Paul says, "In view of all of this, all of this, knowing Christ is the reason
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.400]   why he does what he does."
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:34.120]   Ephesians 4, 11-13, "And he gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to evangelists,
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.520]   some to be pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints, for the work of the service,
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:43.400]   to building up of the body of Christ, until we all attain the unity of the faith and the
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:48.440]   knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:53.320]   to the fullness of Christ."
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:59.160]   Whole purpose of church is not to meet your felt needs.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.400]   Let me make that clear.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:08.640]   The whole purpose of the church is not to make lonely people find community.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:14.960]   The whole purpose of the church is not to gather together to make the political scenery
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:20.880]   right, to feed the poor people, to release people who are captive.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.880]   All of these things are good things that Christians should be engaged in, but the primary purpose
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:35.240]   of our gathering is to proclaim Christ, that you and I may know him, that we may be filled
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:41.240]   with Christ, not to just taste Christ, not to be near Christ, not to simply be affiliated
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:47.120]   with Christ, but to have a deep covenant love relationship with Christ.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:55.800]   Because when we are in love with Christ, we will obey Christ, and his law is not burdensome.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.580]   When we are in love with Christ, we tend to talk about things that we love.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:05.120]   If you love Boba, Boba comes out of your mouth.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.040]   If you watch the movie and you loved watching that movie, it doesn't matter if you're an
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.160]   extrovert or an introvert.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.880]   Nobody watches a movie that they really, really like, then comes home and your wife says,
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   "How was the movie?"
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.440]   He's like, "I don't want to talk about it."
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.480]   You end up talking about it.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.640]   You end up talking about it, you end up sharing it with other people, you put it on your post,
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:31.840]   you put it on your Instagram, you take pictures and you send it to people because you've experienced
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.880]   something that brought great joy to you.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.720]   Evangelism happens when people fall in love with Christ.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.720]   Worship happens, not because we set the right mood or because we had the best worship leader
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.640]   or because there was the greatest preparation or we chose the best songs and all of these
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.880]   things are helpful, there's nothing wrong with any of these things, but worship happens
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.900]   because it's already in you.
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:05.640]   You can sing the most simplest of songs and you can encounter Christ because Christ is
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   in that song.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:13.000]   See, that's what it means to have the fullness of Christ.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.920]   Let me see if I can get through this sermon today.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.240]   I think I will.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:28.080]   That was the longest part of the sermon, so this is the second one, which is all related.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:34.440]   Knowing God is the primary, is first before serving God.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.280]   John 5, 39-42, Jesus said, "You search the scriptures because you think that in them
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.040]   you have eternal life.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.100]   It is these that testify about me.
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:46.120]   You are unwilling to come to me so that you may have life.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.080]   I do not receive glory from men, but I know you that you do not have the love of God in
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.080]   yourselves."
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.080]   Why?
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.640]   It's not because they didn't study the scriptures.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.200]   They studied the scriptures to think that if they followed what it says that they're
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.200]   going to have eternal life.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.960]   He says, "No.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:06.200]   The primary purpose of the scriptures is to bring you to me."
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.840]   That's what he was saying.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.560]   All of it was about me.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:17.000]   Before we look at scripture to find out what we ought to do, he said, "The primary purpose
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.040]   of scripture is to reveal him."
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:27.200]   He says, "If you miss him, all the other stuff that you do is for nothing because there's
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.200]   no life in that."
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.720]   He didn't say, "Come to the scriptures."
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:38.160]   A lot of times what happens is we study the Bible like we're doing homework.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   We do homework.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:44.440]   If you're an A student, you're good at homework.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.560]   You do it and you memorize scripture and you do all of these things and you're good at
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:51.080]   it, but your affection for Christ never grows because you missed the whole point of the
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.360]   Bible study.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:59.440]   The whole point of the Bible study is our pursuit of this mystery.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.820]   The whole point of Ephesians.
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:07.840]   Why there's three chapters of the gospel revealed in detail.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:13.640]   You know, I can say all of that in the New Testament, but Ephesians in particular, especially
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:18.760]   the first three chapters, you can literally give a sermon on every single verse of that
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.400]   book because it is so rich.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:28.560]   Predestination, election, regeneration, adoption, atonement.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.680]   It's so rich.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:38.120]   But all of it is not simply so we can say, "Oh, now I got the gospel down."
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:45.680]   The whole purpose of it is so that we may come to a fuller understanding of who he is.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:53.840]   The purpose of the study of the Bible is really for the purpose of pursuing Christ.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:58.760]   This mystery that was revealed that caused us to know, want to know more.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.760]   Like, why?
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.760]   Why would he do this?
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:06.960]   How did he do this?
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:16.320]   Years ago, when I had to get a side job to make ends meet, I used to work as an ESL teacher.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:20.640]   They assigned me, because I was Korean and my Korean was good enough, they assigned me
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:25.520]   for Lamarda School District, assigned me to a bunch of old Korean ladies.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.200]   The young ones there were in their early 70s.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:32.160]   The older ones were in their mid 80s.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.920]   The reason why they were there, part of it was because they were trying to kill time.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   They weren't really that interested in learning English.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.480]   They tried.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:45.440]   I literally had one lesson for five years because the next class started, they forgot
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.680]   everything, so I start over.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.640]   But some of them started really hard because they're trying to get their citizenship.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.040]   After the class was over, I would always have a citizenship class.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:01.240]   I remember this one particular lady who failed the citizenship test about three times.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.240]   She was so distraught, but she was so determined.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.760]   She's 85 years old, and I would say, "Good morning, students.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:15.160]   Today is August 2nd, the Tuesday of 1995," or something like that.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.400]   They would repeat after me.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.040]   This lady just couldn't even remember that.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.760]   We say it every single morning.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.060]   She's 85 years old.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:27.920]   She was determined to pass this test, so I worked with her.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.840]   In my mind, I'm thinking, "She's not going to pass this test," but you know what I mean?
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.160]   Just to keep her busy.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:38.880]   I would ask back and forth these questions, which she already did three times.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.360]   I would ask her questions like, "Who wrote the Declaration of Independence?"
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:47.360]   It's a hard question, but she's been studying this for 10 years.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.660]   I said, "Thomas Jefferson.
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:52.840]   Who wrote the Star Spangled Banner?
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.600]   Francis Scott Keat.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.280]   What are the three branches of the government?"
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:01.720]   She would answer these questions that some of you guys probably don't know.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.440]   You would fail the citizenship test.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:10.480]   This 85-year-old lady was doing this, and finally the day came, and then she was answering
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.480]   these questions.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.480]   To my surprise, she got it.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.840]   But what was interesting is if I asked in any other way, if I changed one word in the
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.000]   way that I asked her, she wouldn't understand.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.240]   Instead of saying, "Who wrote the Declaration of Independence?"
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.480]   If I said, "The Declaration of Independence, who wrote it?"
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:33.000]   She'd look a blank stare, like, "What did you just say?"
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.360]   I didn't expect her to pass.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.720]   She went, took the test.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.000]   Sure enough, she came back.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.280]   I could tell by the smile on her face that morning that she was elated.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.520]   She finally passed, and she packed all of these Korean food for me, because she was
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.080]   so happy that she passed.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:55.040]   We had this huge celebration in the class.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.040]   She passed, she passed.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:00.380]   It took her 10 years, but she passed, and she was so thankful.
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:04.560]   In the middle of the class, we were just thanking her, and you did a great job, and all the
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:11.080]   younger ladies were patting her, and it's like, "Grandma, you did such a great job."
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:18.120]   Then I asked her, "Who wrote ...?" Just for fun.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.200]   Who wrote the Declaration of Independence?
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:24.320]   She's like, "Huh?"
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.720]   Who wrote the Star-Spangled Banner?
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.160]   "What is he saying?"
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:34.080]   She couldn't understand a single question that I gave her, because once she passed the
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:40.880]   test, she lost it.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:48.060]   Now I don't think most Christians are that bad, but there's a huge difference between
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:55.340]   somebody who's pursuing Christ through his word, versus somebody who's doing homework.
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.560]   You know how that feels.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:02.280]   Many of you experienced cramming for tests, and maybe you got an A, but literally a week
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:08.040]   later you don't remember a thing you studied.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:14.160]   The Word of God, knowing God, first and foremost, the Word of God is about knowing him before
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.760]   serving him.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.360]   That was the difference between Mary and Martha.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.960]   Martha's there just working, "What do I do?
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:22.960]   I got to do this.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.960]   I got to serve God."
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.000]   Martha's just sitting there, just like, "I want to hear from you."
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:36.880]   That's why we always say when young guys want to go into ministry, a typical thing that
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:42.800]   we will hear is they want to teach, which is great, but in order to be a great teacher,
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.960]   you have to be a great student.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.680]   There isn't hungering and thirsting for Christ.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.000]   You can't be a teacher of Christ.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.520]   Third, knowing God is ultimately the fuel for sanctification, and we go faster here.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.600]   Second period, one, two, three.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:05.720]   Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord, seeing
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:10.800]   that his divine power is granted to us, everything pertaining to life of Godliness through the
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:17.720]   true knowledge of him, who called us by his own glory and excellence.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:22.400]   The Bible says that everything that you and I need for Godliness is found where?
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.400]   In the new technique?
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:30.380]   In some seminar, some conference, seminary, some church that kind of figured out a new
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.760]   way to reach the new generation?
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.760]   What does it say?
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.960]   Everything that you and I need to know for the life of Godliness is where?
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.680]   Through the knowledge of his son.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:46.680]   Think about when you first became a Christian and when you were the most excited about your
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.680]   faith.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:53.200]   It might have been when you first got saved, it might have been some other point in your
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.640]   life.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:06.880]   You could be in love with Christ almost anywhere because he was overflowing in you.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:12.440]   When my heart is right, I can hear a sermon from a 15-year-old just talking about how
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:23.120]   much they love Jesus and I would be filled because my heart is fertile.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:26.520]   I don't need a thunderstorm.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.800]   I just need to hear Christ.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:37.480]   But when your heart is not fertile, you can hear John Piper, John MacArthur, Jonathan
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.200]   Edwards.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:45.200]   You can hear the best sermons that the top theologians, the top pastors, top conference
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:53.520]   speakers and if they're not on their A game, you get very little out of it.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.160]   That is not about their sermon, it's our hearts that become hearted.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:06.360]   So he said everything that we need is found in Christ.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:13.840]   Knowing him, having an intimate relationship with him, loving him, solves so many problems
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.720]   in the church.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:26.280]   Social conflict, small group, lack of communication, differences of opinion, shortcomings of others,
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:33.360]   people from different backgrounds, racial reconciliation, so many problems are easily
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:41.560]   fixed when the church is filled with people who are in love with Christ.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:47.360]   What is lacking is not technique or organization, it is lacking the fuel that causes us to be
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.360]   united.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:52.920]   It's the fuel that causes us to love one another and to forgive and to be gracious,
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.920]   which is Christ.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.840]   And it's always Christ.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.240]   Let me conclude finally with this.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:08.840]   Knowing God is what ultimately leads to loving God.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.480]   Knowing God is what ultimately leads to loving God.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:17.480]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5, "For the love of Christ controls us or compels us.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:21.360]   Having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died and he died for all so
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:26.360]   that they who live might no longer live for themselves, but for him who died and rose
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.160]   again on their behalf."
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:35.640]   See, loving Christ, you can't love Christ from a distance.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:42.880]   It's because a lot of times it's because we've accepted this tremendous message of the cross
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:49.240]   and all we did was, "Okay, anybody want a free gift of salvation?
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:52.360]   The God of the universe died for you on the cross so that you don't go to hell?
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.640]   And anybody believe that?
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:54.640]   Anybody want that?
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:55.640]   Oh yeah, me.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.640]   Why wouldn't I?
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.360]   Even if I don't believe it, just in case."
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:05.220]   And Christ means nothing more than fire insurance to a lot of people in the church.
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:12.000]   And that's why all the other parts of scripture where we are told to love our enemies, to
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.600]   share the gospel, to pick up the cross, to sacrifice, to put his kingdom first, all of
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:22.640]   these other things have become a burden because all Christ was to so many in the church was
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:27.320]   fire insurance and that's all they want of him.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:34.820]   But those of us who have tasted the goodness of God, when our eyes became open to the glory
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:43.680]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ, a hunger was ignited in us that can never be satisfied
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:47.600]   other than Christ himself.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.760]   Maybe some of us have forgotten that.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:56.600]   Maybe some of us have learned to be religious and come to church and do our homework.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:01.040]   Maybe some of us have become really good at doing our homework.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:06.560]   But you don't know what it means to love Christ.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:13.120]   As a Christian, there's nothing more important than to obey what Christ says.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:19.080]   To love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:25.000]   And as an overflow of that, we will talk about what we talk about tomorrow.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.340]   Just to give you a preview.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:30.120]   Not tomorrow, next week.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:40.440]   If you jump straight to love others as yourself without knowing, practicing, and having and
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:44.080]   confessing the first part, loving the Lord with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:52.900]   Without that, there's nothing more miserable in life than to love sinners as yourself.
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:59.040]   Those of you who are young and inexperienced, say, "Man, this guy's really cynical."
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:04.880]   Those of you who lived a little know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:11.280]   There's nothing harder to do than to surround yourself with sinners and to sacrifice for
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.280]   them.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:16.680]   We'll talk about that next week.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:21.480]   But as I conclude today, I know we're all busy.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:25.560]   Some of you guys are parents with small children in the home.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:32.000]   For you, a vacation is just not being around kids for a short period of time.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   You're exhausted, you're tired.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.320]   Some of you guys are just trying to make ends meet.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:43.120]   Some of you guys are trying to get a job and you don't know about your future.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.120]   There's a lot of things.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:48.020]   Some of you guys have faced tragic things in life and you're in the middle of dealing with
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:51.520]   all of that.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:58.400]   And I do not mean to be flippant, but I am absolutely convinced that no matter where
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:04.960]   you are in your life, the answer is always Christ.
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.240]   There is no life outside of Christ.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:13.720]   And I really hope that you would let this digest when Jesus says, "I am the way and
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:17.240]   the truth and the life.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.400]   No one comes to the Father but through Him."
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:29.000]   Let's pray.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:35.680]   Heavenly Father, I pray for myself, I pray for our church.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:40.400]   Lord, in the midst of the spiritual battle that we are in, help us, Lord God, not to
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.600]   be stagnant.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:47.440]   Help us not to simply coast along and drift, but teach us what it means to be anchored
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:55.240]   in Christ, that we may know Him, that we may pursue Him, that we may study Him, that we
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.800]   may love Him.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.960]   We pray, Father God, that Your Holy Spirit would continue to convict and guide us, protect
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:05.540]   us from temptation, deliver us from evil.
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:14.320]   Give us to say our daily bread, that the Father's name will be hallowed, that His will be done
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.720]   on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:20.160]   Amen. Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
