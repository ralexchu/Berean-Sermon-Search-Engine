[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   The famous preacher Martin Lloyd-Jones in a sermon on Philippians said, "False
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.000]   doctrine makes joy in the Lord impossible." Pastor John, how would you
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.880]   articulate this connection between orthodoxy and joy? How does false
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.720]   doctrine make joy in the Lord impossible? The key in that phrase, I think, is "in the
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.200]   Lord, joy in the Lord." False doctrine can make you very happy. If you don't believe
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:39.000]   in hell, you might feel happier. If you don't believe that you have to not sleep
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.680]   around on the weekend and cheat on your wife, then you might have some brief
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.560]   surges of pleasure. But when he says false doctrine makes joy in the Lord
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.160]   impossible, he's articulating something really important, namely the only joy
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.800]   that glorifies God is joy that is based on a true view of God. If you have
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.000]   happiness because you see God the way he's not, you might have happiness based
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.360]   on your doctrine. But your doctrine would be false, and therefore God would not be
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.400]   honored by your happiness. You're like a person who's just really watching
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.240]   his favorite football team, and he just crossed the goal line. Yeah, yeah, he's
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.080]   cheering his lungs out. He realized he ran the wrong way. He crossed the wrong
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.800]   goal line. He didn't make six points. He lost. And so that
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.920]   cheering isn't honoring the team. It's making a fool out of the team. And so
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.920]   false doctrine presents God or his ways in the way that they're not. And if we
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:53.080]   are happy by what God is not, then he's not honored by our happiness. And
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:01.040]   so right doctrine is in fact a way of showing God in his ways as they really
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.240]   are, so that our joy can be in what is, and then our joy is an honor to God, and
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.120]   God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him. I don't always
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.920]   say, but I should say more often probably, that when I say that, God is most
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.440]   glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him. It presumes that the
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.960]   God in whom we are satisfied is the true God, that we have true views of him, and
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:37.640]   so false views of God will prevent joy in the true God, and that's the only joy
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.400]   that honors God. And I don't know whether he had it in mind or
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.680]   whether you have it in mind when you ask the question, but clearly if you have a
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.840]   wrong view of salvation, you lose your joy forever. And that's what was
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.800]   happening in the book of Galatians. They knew God, and the Pharisees knew
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.320]   God, and Jesus says, "You're children of hell, and you're going there because your
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.520]   view of how to relate to God is upside down. You think that God is impressed by
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.600]   your works for him and that you can put him in your debt, and you can't. That's a
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.440]   hellish doctrine, and cursed are those who bring the gospel like that," Paul said.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.760]   So all happiness vanishes, and that's probably what ultimately Martyn Lloyd
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.320]   Jones meant, is all happiness is going to vanish for those who follow a false
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.080]   gospel. So it seems built into this is some level of distrust towards our own
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.720]   affections. That's a very good point. In fact, the way I would build on
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.720]   that, I have been criticized sometimes for being a hedonist, a Christian hedonist,
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:52.040]   because historic hedonism has often meant pleasure becomes the criterion of
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.360]   what is right. You discern what is right by what makes you happy. That's never
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.040]   ever been what I've meant by hedonism. All I mean by Christian hedonism is you
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.880]   are living to maximize your pleasure forever, and that's the biblical sense of
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.040]   why it's right to pursue your happiness. But yes, we must be very
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:23.280]   suspicious of making our pleasures the criteria of what is right, or holy, or
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.720]   good, or true. You do it the other way around. You let the Bible decide what's
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.960]   true, and then you labor to submit your heart to that so that you can find
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.400]   happiness in the truth, not determine what is true by what makes you happy.
