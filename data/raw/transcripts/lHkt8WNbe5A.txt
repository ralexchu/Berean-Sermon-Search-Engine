[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:38.460]   - And 11.30, 12.30.
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.780]   And so when you come, there's gonna be instructions,
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.100]   especially for the first couple of weeks,
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.940]   so we need to get used to how things are gonna be running.
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.700]   And so just, again, please come a little bit earlier.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.020]   You're gonna have to go through the scanning.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.620]   You have to wear your mask when you do come to church.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.980]   And so we wanna follow all the precautions
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.220]   that we need to take as our church slowly begins to open up
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.540]   and we hope that within the next month or so,
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.760]   the governor said that they're gonna revisit
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.620]   and to see maybe phase three may be open.
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.460]   And so he said that phase three actually includes Disneyland.
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.060]   And so if Disneyland opens,
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.580]   obviously there's not gonna be any reason
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:20.180]   for the churches to have some kind of restriction.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.420]   So again, we'll take all the precautions we need to,
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.260]   but we're thinking that at that time,
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.900]   we're gonna be able to meet in larger numbers,
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.360]   not like the way we met before,
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.980]   but maybe hopefully a little bit bigger
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.500]   than we are able to do now.
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.300]   So again, we're waiting and watching for that.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.500]   And I just kinda wanna give you just our thought process
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.700]   and what we've been praying over as our church opens up.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.060]   We wanted to make sure.
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.620]   There are three things that we are considering carefully
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.580]   as we open up.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.980]   And again, as you guys know,
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.060]   we took a little bit longer than most churches to close
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.200]   for a specific reason.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.740]   Because first and foremost,
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.300]   we said that our worship is God-centered and not man-centered.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.900]   So we wanna make sure that not only the leadership
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.100]   of the church understands the high calling
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.780]   of corporate worship.
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.140]   That what we are experiencing online,
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.260]   I mean, as great as it is that we have this avenue
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.380]   to do that, because again, we have brothers
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.860]   all over the world who don't have that access.
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.460]   But it cannot ever replace the corporate worship
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.620]   of the church.
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.420]   It is not a church sitting at home.
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.220]   Again, not the way that Christ called us
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.080]   to gather together.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.980]   So we wanna make sure that we are honoring God
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.940]   first and foremost, that corporate worship
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.300]   is not something that we just simply fold
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.820]   because it's inconvenient.
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.620]   We wanna make sure that again, that it is to us,
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.660]   whether the government or the world that we live in
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:45.020]   says it's not essential, to us it is always essential.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.620]   And it is not just one of the essentials,
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.700]   it is the essential thing that we need to commit to.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.540]   And so because of that, we wanted to be careful.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.100]   But secondly, we wanted to make sure
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.740]   that we're obedient to the local government.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.740]   That we're not just simply gonna defy them.
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.220]   The Bible does tell us in Romans 13
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.380]   to submit ourselves to the local government.
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.460]   And they have a job to do.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.540]   They're not specifically saying Christians cannot meet.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.080]   So we wanna do our best, and that's why
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.820]   we've been patiently waiting.
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.420]   And so now that the government has released that
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.540]   and we are able to come together,
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.200]   and we're gonna try to do our best to follow
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.460]   the instructions that they give us
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.300]   until we are not able to do so.
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.580]   That compromising our faith in God
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.020]   is required for us to submit to the government,
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.500]   then the Bible is clear on that as well.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.060]   But third principle that we are being careful about,
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.860]   that we need to shepherd and protect our church.
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.260]   And so we wanna take this seriously.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.740]   We wanna make sure that all the precautions
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.380]   that the government and the health officials
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.860]   are telling us that we are taking
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.460]   all the precautions that we need.
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.580]   So there's gonna be a video that you're gonna be seeing
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.620]   online this week of what you should be expecting
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.180]   and how we are preparing.
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.180]   One, for peace of mind for those of you who are coming,
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.620]   that we're not just being cavalier about this
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.740]   and we're not taking, you know,
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.860]   we don't want you to be concerned
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.620]   that we're not taking this seriously.
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.620]   We are going to do everything in our power.
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.820]   Every single person coming into the room
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.100]   is gonna be thermal scanned.
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.860]   Everyone has to bring their mask
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.540]   and keep it on during the time that they're here.
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.740]   Afterwards, people need to leave, you know,
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.220]   and again, minimum contact with social distancing.
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.020]   And also, in between each service,
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.340]   we're gonna be sanitizing everything,
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.820]   the bathrooms, wherever people are,
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.580]   so that in between each service,
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.860]   we wanna make sure that the next group of people coming in
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.020]   are coming into a room that has been sanitized.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.020]   And so, based upon those three principles,
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.220]   we've been carefully praying and having discussions,
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.660]   and we thought that, again, it was right timing
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.380]   because of all the things that are going on
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.260]   for us to open up.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.940]   So please be prayerful, and again,
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.860]   we're not exactly where we want to be.
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.020]   We're slowly getting there, but please be mindful of that.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.380]   Along with that, we have a few quick announcements.
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:04.380]   Again, all the times currently are full,
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.940]   but there are a few people who are dropping out here
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.220]   and there, so if you guys want to be on a waiting list,
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.780]   whether that happens next week
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.340]   or maybe in the following weeks,
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.020]   sign up for which service that you would like to come
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.180]   if there is space, and then if somebody drops out
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:25.060]   or the government allows us to have more people in the room,
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.980]   we'll be able to add you to those services.
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.780]   So even if we may be currently full,
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.940]   if you are hoping to do so as soon as we are able to,
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.140]   please go online and sign up for the service
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.020]   that you would like to go, maybe a couple of 'em,
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.420]   and then when we are open, we'll let you know
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.120]   that you can come that week, okay?
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:48.980]   Next Sunday, we are planning to have communion
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.360]   with the people who are at the physical church.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.700]   We're hoping that the next time we have it,
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.740]   that again, all of us will be able to gather together
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.780]   and have communion, but for those of you who are here,
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.160]   we just want you to prepare ahead of time,
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.940]   and again, the communions are gonna be done
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.460]   a little bit differently for the purpose of
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.880]   trying to respect the health purposes in the church,
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.400]   so again, when you come next week,
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.260]   you'll see what's going on with that.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.540]   And please, please review the safety outlines
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.000]   before you come to church next Sunday.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.180]   Again, for India pastors, we are taking renewed sign up
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.540]   for monthly commitment, $50,
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.620]   and so it'll be going from June to June,
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.460]   and as I've mentioned to you guys before,
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.120]   I've been communicating with the Indian pastors regularly,
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.900]   and what's going on over there,
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.780]   not only for health reasons,
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.780]   but because of what's going on with the COVID,
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:45.300]   the local governments and local Hindus
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.060]   are making it even harder for Christians
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.700]   to access their food, and so we need to get the funds
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.820]   to them as soon as possible.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.300]   Right now, we don't even have an avenue to get there
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.000]   because they're not allowed to move around,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.180]   but as soon as that opens up,
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.540]   we're gonna try to send it to them,
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.700]   and so if you are planning to sign up,
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.980]   please do so as soon as possible,
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.900]   and again, we'll try to get the funds to them
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:05.720]   as soon as we can.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.920]   Then I'll give you more updates
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.060]   when I get it from the pastors.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:14.060]   All right, so we have a few good boys and girls today.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.320]   Jade and Kim was a good boy last week.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.220]   Alex Bae, I heard that you guys,
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.700]   you did a very good job last week.
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.180]   Chloe Lin, again, thank you for helping out with the parents
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.420]   and again, worshiping together in a great way.
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.280]   We have a few birthdays.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.840]   Thomas and Tony Lau is turning five today.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.740]   Happy birthday.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.140]   And then Serenity Lee is turning 12 today.
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.660]   Happy birthday.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.380]   Okay, all right, so just like,
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.620]   even though when we get together,
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.140]   we're gonna have our service,
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.740]   we're gonna keep it the same way that we've been having it
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.900]   with the change of, we're gonna have the opening
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.100]   pray song to begin with,
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.540]   and then I'll come up and give the announcements,
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.820]   and then the offering time is going to be the same.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.700]   Because most of us are gonna be doing it electronically,
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.380]   for those of you who are able to come here
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.820]   and you want to use physical checks,
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:10.120]   we're gonna ask you, we're gonna have a offering basket
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.020]   or offering house set up in the back.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.940]   So as you're coming in or going out,
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.020]   you wanna put your physical offering there.
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.820]   Otherwise, we're gonna ask you to continue
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.500]   to do electronic offerings so that we don't have
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.120]   to pass around the offering baskets
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.740]   with people touching it, okay?
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.700]   So let me pray for us and we'll open up the service,
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.700]   and again, we'll give you about 30 seconds
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.180]   to give your offering, okay?
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:36.940]   Gracious, loving Father, we thank you so much
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.340]   for being sovereign, that in the midst of so much chaos
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.520]   and turmoil in this world, and even today,
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.540]   we pray, Father God, that you would remind us
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.140]   where we find our peace.
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:52.800]   You truly are the King of righteousness and King of peace.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.540]   Help us, Lord God, that this is not simply our doctrines
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.380]   that we confess, but the thing that we cling to,
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.800]   especially now.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.660]   I pray that the offering that we give to you
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.300]   may be cheerful, intentional,
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.700]   and may it be multiplied for your use.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.340]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.400]   (gentle piano music)

[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:33.560]   Why don't we all stand together again,
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.400]   at least those of you in the room?
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.480]   (gentle piano music)

[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.240]   (papers rustling)
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:37:00.720]   All right, again, we're eagerly anticipating
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.160]   for the church to come back.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.880]   And I think if there's any, you know,
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.360]   one good thing that came out of all of this
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.600]   or is coming out of all of this
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.720]   is a greater thought about
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.120]   the corporate gathering of the church.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.920]   And I know because of the internet,
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.760]   many of the churches have been wrestling with the idea
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.120]   of going online and how to minister to people
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.280]   and reach out to people online.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.840]   But along with that came the challenge of
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.600]   the loss of the importance of the
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.640]   physical corporate gathering of the church.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.600]   And more and more people have been
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.080]   just kind of nonchalantly taking the corporate gathering.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.280]   And I think this has at least caused
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.520]   the conversations to happen,
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.800]   to take a deeper look at to
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.200]   what the corporate worship really means.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.320]   Why do we need to have to get together?
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.880]   What is the purpose of the Sabbath?
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.040]   What is the difference between having service
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.500]   in your own living room
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.560]   versus the physical gathering of the church?
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.160]   And hopefully when we gather together,
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.440]   not only in our churches, but other churches,
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.920]   that that may be restored in a high view of God
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.120]   and high view of worship may be restored in the churches.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.680]   We're gonna be jumping into Hebrews chapter seven again.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.680]   And I'm just gonna read the first verse
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.040]   before we jump in this morning.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.600]   And I'm gonna take some time.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.760]   Usually I don't talk about political things,
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.440]   but this morning I'm gonna jump into a bit
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.120]   before we get into the text itself.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.440]   Because of many things that are going on
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.380]   around the world right now.
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.400]   So let me read verse one.
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.480]   For this Melchizedek, king of Salem,
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.240]   priest of the most high God,
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.280]   who met Abraham as he was returning
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.040]   from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:37.860]   Let's pray.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:42.760]   Father, we thank you so much for who you are.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:47.880]   None of us are worthy to call you Abba Father
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.940]   by our own merit.
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:53.480]   We are here, Lord God, as sinners who are forgiven.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:59.800]   We are here unworthy, Lord God, to be in your presence.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.200]   And yet we come to your throne with boldness
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.760]   because of the blood of Christ.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.060]   I pray that that truth would convict us,
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:12.120]   renew our faith, renew our passion, renew our love,
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.200]   and whatever it is in our thoughts, our emotions,
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.280]   in our lives, Lord, that we have been entangled with.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.140]   I pray, Father God, that that truth may deliver us.
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.560]   May our focus be you and you alone.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.120]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:35.580]   I think all of us know what's going on to a certain degree.
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:38.960]   Some of you guys may be following what's going on
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.080]   in the news probably more closely than other people
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.160]   and obviously we had the COVID-19 fear
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.240]   which we're not out of the woods yet.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.880]   It seems like it is getting better.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   But as a result of that, the churches have shut down.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.200]   Many people who are in businesses,
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.920]   some of you have been furloughed.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.520]   Maybe some people lost their jobs permanently.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.320]   And so there's a lot of stuff that's going on
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.920]   behind the scenes.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.160]   Politics, whose fault is it?
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.240]   Who did what was wrong?
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.400]   Who is doing right?
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.520]   And every day we have, especially in this country,
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.280]   we have two parties who are eager to blame each other
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.520]   and point fingers, thinking that maybe the solution
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.780]   is in their party.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:22.040]   We have financial crisis, international affairs.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.100]   We have issues with what's going on in China,
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.560]   with Iran, with North Korea.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:32.360]   There's problems going on even between China and India.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.360]   And so if you're watching the news carefully,
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:39.520]   it almost seems like it's just ready to blow.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.840]   And then on top of all of that, you know very well
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.240]   what's been going on around us in Los Angeles.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.160]   And even in Irvine today, I heard news that there's going
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.080]   to be a protest happening at the Civic Center.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.720]   And so again, we wanna caution you not to drive in that
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.360]   area because they have planned protests in that area.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:03.020]   What happened this week with the racial tensions,
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:08.020]   the killing of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd?
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.400]   I think we've all seen videos and I haven't talked
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:16.640]   to a single person who wasn't outraged of what they saw.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.640]   If what they are saying is true, it must stop.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.400]   Protests are a good thing, again, within reason.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.240]   You know, we're not talking about like burning down
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.640]   buildings, but again, to make sure that some of these things
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.440]   that are happening, that policies need to be changed,
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.640]   there needs to be accountability.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.680]   And I think we are all in agreement with that.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:45.680]   But we must not conform to the pattern of this world.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.560]   Romans chapter two, 12 verse two, it says,
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.280]   "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.000]   "by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.820]   "what the will of God is, that which is good
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.120]   "and acceptable and perfect."
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.120]   So when he's talking about not to conform to the pattern
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.440]   of this world, he's not simply talking about pornography
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.960]   and murder and killing.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.360]   It's just the way, what we value, how we respond to things,
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:19.320]   how we react to things, that we don't react and think
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.960]   and implement things just like the world,
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.000]   because our values are different.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.660]   What is important is different.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.200]   Our answer, what we believe to be the answer
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.240]   to human problem is different.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.560]   Politics isn't gonna solve it.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.680]   Just because you change laws,
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.480]   it doesn't change the heart of men.
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:41.620]   So this racial tension that has been simmering for years,
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:46.440]   probably decades, it's beginning to explode.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.440]   Tinder has always been laying there,
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.960]   but what has happened in the last few weeks
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.920]   has basically put that into flames.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.120]   Let me make this very clear.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.840]   There's a few things that I wanna say about racism,
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.780]   and this isn't completely disconnected
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.360]   with what we need to talk about this morning,
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.200]   about Melchizedek.
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:10.260]   Okay, racism is sickening, is sickening.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:16.100]   You know, I think all of us, to some degree,
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.660]   no matter what national background you're from,
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:22.240]   may have experienced some of that, some more than others.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.000]   I remember when I first came to the United States,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.660]   we were so excited because Korea
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.140]   was a third world country in the '70s.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.460]   And so we barely ate meat.
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:34.900]   You know, I could remember a few times where we had candy,
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.240]   you know, at least that's what I remember.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.900]   You know, eating fruit was a huge treat in the '70s.
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.960]   And so coming to the United States basically meant
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.600]   that we thought we were coming to heaven on earth.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:52.480]   We moved, my parents moved to Philadelphia,
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.040]   and my earliest memories of Philadelphia
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.000]   was my parents working their tail off,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.760]   coming home at 10, 11 p.m. at night,
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.000]   and me and my brothers, basically, we were latchkey kids,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.800]   you know, and my younger brother, Philip,
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.280]   coming home, walking home from school
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:09.080]   when he was five years old and losing him one day.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.580]   So, you know, all of these things
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.380]   are memories of my childhood.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.640]   And we also moved to Kansas,
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.960]   and I remember being in Kansas, we were so weird in Kansas.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.080]   And not only were we the only Asians,
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.780]   we were the only minorities, period.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.500]   So we had three Asians in the school,
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.200]   me, my two brothers, and that was it.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.720]   And I remember back then,
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.640]   because she couldn't pronounce my Korean name,
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.560]   my teacher would actually call me China Boy.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.840]   And so it wasn't weird, because it's like,
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.520]   oh, China Boy, I'm the only China Boy in the class,
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.440]   so she must be referring to me.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.600]   And again, as a third grade student,
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.320]   didn't think much about it, you know,
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.360]   that's just the way it is.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.200]   And then we moved to Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.840]   In Atlanta, Georgia, in the South, in the '70s,
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.640]   I mean, racism was blatantly out in the open,
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.840]   not just the teachers, but even the students.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:03.720]   And I remember every single day, somebody calling me chink.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.600]   And so, unlike my brothers, I didn't just absorb it.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.720]   So I got into fights, you know?
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.360]   And so every day I went to school,
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.000]   I thought maybe today I'm gonna lose it.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.200]   So even to this day, I don't like wearing slippers outside.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.160]   Because mentally, mentally,
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.120]   even though those are like decades and decades ago,
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:29.520]   mentally, I think maybe something's gonna happen today.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.660]   So I don't wanna be wearing slippers.
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.540]   Even though it's irrational.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.960]   That's embedded, yes or no.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.360]   I don't like wearing slippers outside, right?
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.860]   For that reason, just in case something goes down.
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.400]   When my parents decided to go back to Korea,
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.560]   I thought, okay, finally,
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.960]   we're gonna go back to my home country where I belong,
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.440]   because clearly I don't belong here.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.280]   And I was made very aware of that when I went back.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.200]   But I realized that I didn't belong there either.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.320]   That short time that I was here in the United States,
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.200]   about four or five years, I was Korean American.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.880]   I wasn't Korean anymore.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.260]   And so I remember being in Korea,
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.620]   constantly being told to go back to my country.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.580]   My country, where is my country?
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.660]   'Cause I thought I was in my country.
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:13.140]   And that's when I realized that I didn't have one.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.660]   I didn't belong there, and I didn't belong here.
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:20.500]   And right around that time, I was about 12, 13 years old,
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.260]   and going through an identity crisis.
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:24.300]   And when my parents decided to come back
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:28.100]   to the United States, I came back kicking and screaming.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.820]   'Cause it wasn't going back to heaven on earth anymore.
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.420]   I knew exactly where I was going back to.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.380]   I was going back to a place where I didn't belong,
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:39.420]   where I'm gonna have to fight just to be a part of a school
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.420]   wherever my parents went to.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:45.700]   So even to this day, when I see racism,
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.500]   it reminds me of all of that.
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.860]   And if there's one thing that I hate,
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:55.380]   one sin that I truly, truly hate, is racism.
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.680]   Because it scarred me deeply when I was young.
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:02.900]   But when I say that, I'm not talking about just anything.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.160]   Because sometimes the way that we call racism
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:08.120]   cheapens that sin of racism.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.740]   There is a difference between people being insensitive.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:15.320]   There is a huge difference between people being ignorant.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.500]   They don't have evil intent.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.200]   It's just that they haven't been around other people
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:21.140]   who are different than them.
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.100]   And so they say things that they would say with their race
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.020]   or the people that they're familiar with,
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.700]   and they don't realize that this may be offensive
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:29.540]   to somebody else.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.880]   And I don't consider that racism.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.700]   That's just being ignorant.
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.140]   Oftentimes being very insensitive.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:41.360]   Racism is sickening at the core when it is true racism.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.340]   But racism is also universal.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.300]   It is not local.
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:49.960]   Racism doesn't just exist in one group of people.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:54.200]   Because at the core of it, it's prejudice.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.660]   And every single one of us is prejudiced.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:48:00.660]   So if I say Chinese people are, or Koreans are,
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:05.980]   black people are, Mexicans are, we have certain thoughts.
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.340]   Some of us are careful not to express it,
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:11.480]   but we all have certain thoughts.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.800]   People in Irvine are, people in Santa Ana are,
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.580]   people who are short are, people who are big are.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:23.140]   We all have certain prejudices that we have inwardly,
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.980]   and we know how to temper that
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.780]   because we know how it will be perceived.
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:31.580]   But at the core of prejudice, or racism, it's prejudice.
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:34.020]   And every single one of us is guilty of that
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:37.020]   because the sin of prejudice resides in all of us.
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.020]   Because at the core of prejudice,
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.320]   we elevate ourselves above other people.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:46.780]   And at the core of human rebellion is wanting to have glory.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:50.280]   That's why we work hard to be better than other people,
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.420]   to get better jobs, to have better houses,
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.620]   a better career, better schools.
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:59.860]   And all of that innately feeds into, if we're not careful,
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.000]   at the core root of our rebellion.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.300]   And prejudice is a byproduct of every human being
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:11.800]   that is trying hard to be better than other people.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.180]   It's just racism is just the fastest way to get there.
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:19.260]   And that is not isolated in certain people,
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.460]   certain parts of the country.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.900]   It's everywhere, universal.
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.180]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:28.340]   So I wanna ask you to be careful
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:34.140]   to not to react to racism as if we are completely exempt.
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:40.020]   That if we legislate and we get rid of those people,
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.120]   and if we isolate those people,
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.340]   that we will be free from prejudice.
[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:49.620]   Racism is in us, and we have to be careful
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.420]   that in the way that we deal with racism,
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.620]   that we ourselves don't become racist.
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:59.300]   That we don't just make blanket statements.
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:02.500]   When somebody says white people are racist,
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.180]   that's also racism.
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:08.860]   When those people are like this, that's also racism.
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:12.660]   So we need to be very careful and precise.
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.660]   You know, one of the things that I noticed,
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:17.500]   again, doing church ministry for so many years,
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.260]   is that people come to church,
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:24.220]   and if they have a bad experience with a few people,
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.980]   they will leave the church and they will say,
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:29.480]   Berean Community Church is like this.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.820]   And if you sit and talk to them,
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.380]   usually it's because they've had a bad experience
[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:35.900]   with one or two people.
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:39.940]   But our tendency is when we're hurt,
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.420]   when something negative happens to us,
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:43.340]   we're not precise with our criticism.
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.940]   We usually throw bombs,
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.980]   just kind of like what's happening with the riots.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.740]   You know, why are they burning down buildings?
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:51.980]   Why are they looting people,
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.800]   especially in their own neighborhood?
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:56.660]   But we have a tendency, when we're angry about something,
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.820]   when we're hurt and we feel injustice,
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:01.260]   our tendency is to throw bombs.
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:04.020]   We don't have to participate in riots,
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.400]   physically, to be rioting in our hearts,
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.380]   because when we're hurt,
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:10.380]   our natural tendency is to, they're like this,
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.020]   even between husband and wives.
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.340]   When we're angry, we don't say,
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:17.180]   why don't you help me with dishes?
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.700]   We say, how come you never help?
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:22.540]   How come you're always like this?
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:23.940]   Because that is our natural tendency.
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.720]   When we are upset and when we're hurt,
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:28.020]   we have a tendency to throw bombs.
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:30.980]   So we need to be careful that in the way
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:33.780]   that we deal with racism,
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.580]   that we ourselves don't do more damage than good.
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:42.940]   But fourth and finally, racism,
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:47.940]   the answer to racism is always Jesus, is regeneration.
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:52.060]   Because at the root of racism is our human rebellion.
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:56.840]   At the root of racism is our sin.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:01.200]   And so as much as we wanna cry out and say,
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.580]   we don't want what happened to that black brother,
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:08.220]   from what I heard, he was a Christian,
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:10.520]   to ever allow that to happen again,
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.260]   that in our protest,
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:18.940]   I pray that the Christians will see
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:22.720]   the proclamation of the gospel as more important.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:26.460]   That we don't just simply point out what is bad.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:29.100]   That we don't just get outraged and say,
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:30.540]   if we just change the law,
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.340]   if we just lock up a few people,
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:33.940]   this would be a better society.
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:36.820]   You and I are here because we believe
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:37.860]   that that is not the case.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:40.940]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:45.940]   Police department, Asians, blacks, whites, Hispanics,
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:50.240]   all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.900]   Democrats, Republicans, all have sinned
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.500]   and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:59.460]   Americans, Chinese, Korean, Indians, Mexicans,
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.100]   all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:07.220]   So the only remedy to sin that you and I believe
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:11.540]   is a regeneration that happens by the blood of Christ.
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:15.700]   So before we pour so much energy
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:18.780]   into changing the politics,
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:22.340]   again, I think we live in a free country
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.500]   where they give us the right to vote,
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.620]   right to protest, and so when we see evil,
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:29.480]   we should point that out.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.860]   But in the process of pointing evil,
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:35.140]   that we make sure that we give the remedy
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:36.780]   along with pointing out the evil.
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.760]   That the remedy is Christ and Christ alone.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:44.020]   You know, dealing with racism is very tricky,
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:48.140]   especially if you've faced racism before.
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:52.940]   I remember years ago, I had an African American friend
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:56.980]   who I was driving around town and I was in Buena Park.
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:02.100]   And he was sitting to my right and I was driving around,
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.340]   we were trying to look for something
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:05.140]   and I got pulled over by the police.
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:07.740]   And when we got pulled over, I was like,
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.540]   I wasn't speeding, you know,
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.740]   and I, or at least I didn't think I was,
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:14.020]   so what did I do wrong this time?
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:15.820]   So they pulled us over and they told my friend,
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.540]   his name was Michael, to get out of the car.
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:22.100]   And again, he was an African American brother.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.460]   He went out and I was sitting in the car
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.620]   and a police officer came over to me and asked me,
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.140]   are you doing okay?
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.020]   And I said, yeah.
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.620]   So what's this about?
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:32.660]   He's like, okay, we just have to ask some questions.
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:36.020]   So they had a list of questions that they asked him.
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.460]   Then I got out of the car, I said,
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:40.460]   'cause I began to realize what was happening.
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:41.700]   And so I got out of the car and I said,
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.260]   officer, did I do something wrong?
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:44.100]   He's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.700]   We just wanted a double check.
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.780]   And I asked him, what are you double checking?
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:50.980]   I just wanted to make sure that you're okay.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:53.540]   So I said, what do you mean?
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:54.620]   He said, don't worry about it.
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:55.740]   And then asked him a few questions.
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:56.580]   Okay, you can go.
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.140]   And then we got back into the car.
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:01.620]   And so I realized the only reason that we were pulled over
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:04.900]   was because he was black and I was Asian
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.580]   and maybe it fits some profile.
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:08.020]   Maybe there was some report
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.140]   or they were looking for somebody.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:13.140]   And I asked Michael, Michael, does that happen to you often?
[00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:14.660]   And he said, I'm used to it.
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.460]   That's what he said.
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:20.380]   Now, again, I'm also a minority, right?
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.260]   But I don't experience that.
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:24.980]   So he just kind of blew it off as like,
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:25.820]   I'm just used to it.
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:27.460]   And he didn't make much of it.
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:31.460]   I was upset for him.
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.260]   And I was also very confused
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:39.220]   because the officers pulled us over for my protection.
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:41.660]   They were doing their job.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:47.540]   They pulled me over because their duty is to protect.
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:51.020]   And they thought maybe if this is not,
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.860]   maybe it fits some profile.
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:57.180]   And then they really was trying to protect me.
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.700]   So in one sense, I was thankful
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:55:59.940]   that they were doing their job,
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:02.980]   but I was also upset because of my friend.
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:09.660]   Dealing with racism isn't black and white
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:12.660]   because it's not about policy.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:16.140]   It's not about changing programs
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.540]   and getting rid of certain people.
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:24.340]   But all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.860]   The answer is not that simple.
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:31.260]   At least in the eyes of the world.
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.620]   You think, oh, if we can get Republicans
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.660]   to run four more years, we'll have a great country.
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.420]   If we can get the Democrats in office,
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.220]   that things will get so much better.
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:45.580]   That is the lie that Satan tells year after year
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:46.780]   after year after year.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:48.900]   And if you live long enough, you know.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:53.380]   Like the politicians that come and give all these promises,
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:54.340]   these are all promises.
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.780]   And if you've been watching politics,
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.460]   following for any period of time,
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:58.740]   you know that the politicians
[00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:00.460]   are not as powerful as they think.
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:04.620]   Now, what does this have to do
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:06.580]   with the passage that we're looking at?
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.980]   The letter that is written to the Hebrews
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:12.820]   are drifting back to their old life
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:15.660]   because they took their eyes off of Christ
[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:18.180]   and whatever problems that they were having in life,
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:19.420]   they thought it would be easier
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.260]   if they can just go back to the majority,
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:23.420]   if they went back to Judaism.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:25.820]   And they weren't outright doing it.
[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.740]   They were just kind of drifting back
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:30.060]   because that was the easiest path to take.
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:35.060]   And so the author is reminding them to be anchored in Christ.
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:37.260]   Have you forgotten your confession?
[00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:41.420]   Have you forgotten why you come to worship?
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:44.580]   Have you forgotten that Christ
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:47.740]   and Christ alone is your refuge?
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:51.500]   He's the only one who can change our hearts.
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:54.100]   No amount of hard work, no amount of discipline,
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:57.260]   no amount of discipleship is going to weed the sin
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.300]   that has corrupted our very being.
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:02.580]   That's why Jesus said to Nicodemus,
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.620]   "You must be born again."
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:06.380]   He didn't say, "You need to work harder.
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:07.300]   "You need to go to the temple.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:10.620]   "You need to memorize more of the Old Testament."
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.180]   He said, "No, everything that you've done
[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:15.660]   "until you are born again is useless."
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.420]   Well, how can a man be born again?
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.660]   How do I do that?
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:23.220]   He said, "You can't.
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.580]   "It's the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.660]   "Where he comes, where he goes, no one knows.
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:28.740]   "He's like the wind."
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:32.060]   In other words, we're completely helpless.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:37.380]   We're completely helpless until Christ comes and saves us.
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:39.540]   And so that's the underlying tone
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:42.140]   of the whole book of Hebrews,
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.420]   to not to drift, to be anchored in Christ
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:48.260]   so that we would look to him and not to run to the world.
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:50.100]   And that's why he says in Hebrews chapter seven, four,
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.820]   "Observe how great this man was
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:53.340]   "to whom Abraham the patriarch
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:57.180]   "gave a tenth of the choices spoils."
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:59.980]   Observe means to intently look.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:03.060]   And obviously, he's not saying to look at Melchizedek.
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.460]   He's saying to look at Melchizedek
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:10.020]   because Christ comes in the order of Melchizedek.
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:14.300]   Again, at the tail end of book of Hebrews chapter 12,
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.620]   you can say that summary of everything
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.380]   that he's been trying to say in chapter 12, verse two,
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:21.620]   he says, "Fix our eyes on Jesus,
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:23.940]   "the author and the perfecter of our faith."
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:26.140]   Not only is he the one who begins our faith,
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:29.660]   he's the one who's going to continue to sanctify us.
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:33.620]   You don't just begin with Christ and end with hard work.
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:38.620]   You don't just begin by grace and then end with work.
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:40.380]   He says, "No, it is by grace you are saved.
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.740]   "It is by grace you are sanctified.
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:44.580]   "It is by grace that you will be glorified."
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:50.620]   So it humbles us that we are always desperate,
[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.980]   whether you've been a Christian for one year,
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:55.820]   whether you've been a faithful Christian for 40 years.
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:58.980]   Until the day we die, we meet Christ,
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.200]   we are all desperately in need of Christ.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:07.680]   He says, "Christ is different than the other kings.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.140]   "Christ is different than the other priests
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:14.220]   "because he is a king-priest."
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:16.060]   Now, king-priest doesn't sound like much,
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.620]   but if you know the Old Testament,
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:21.500]   it was prohibited for kings to be priests.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.260]   Malchus 6-7-1, it says, "Malchus is the king of Salem,
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.340]   "priest of the most high God."
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:31.100]   God prohibited the kings of Israel to be priests,
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.540]   and the priests were not able to be kings,
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:36.140]   and there's a specific reason for that.
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.460]   See, the kings of Israel had limited power.
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:40.460]   They're not like other kings.
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.900]   So if you were the king of Egypt,
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.020]   if you were the king of Babylon,
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:48.220]   king basically meant that you created the law.
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.240]   In fact, if anybody is immune to the law,
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.100]   it would have been the king because the king creates it.
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.140]   If you broke the law, you can say,
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.640]   "Well, today that's the rule."
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:59.060]   King of Israel did not have that kind of authority
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.980]   because there was a king above that king,
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.180]   and God made that very clear to the nation of Israel.
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:08.780]   Deuteronomy 17, verse 14-20,
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:10.680]   "God was preparing the nation of Israel
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.180]   "to get into the Promised Land,
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:16.380]   "and he foretold that when you get in,
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:19.680]   "one of your primary problems that you're gonna run into
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.940]   "is that you're gonna put your hopes on the kings."
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.720]   So he gives them restrictions.
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:28.400]   Verse 14-20, "When you enter the land
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.800]   "which the Lord your God gives you,
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.240]   "and you possess it and live in it,
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.440]   "and you say, 'I will set a king over me
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.140]   "'like all the nations who are around me.'"
[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.300]   In other words, they were looking for leadership.
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.640]   We want what they have, and he says,
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.360]   "You shall surely set king over you
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.780]   "whom the Lord your God chooses."
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:50.060]   Even the one you choose, he said, "No, I will choose him.
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:51.360]   "One from among your countrymen
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.420]   "who shall set as king over yourselves.
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:55.560]   "You may not put a foreigner over yourself
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.400]   "who is not your countryman."
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.240]   So even the selection of the king,
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.000]   God himself said he's going to do it.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.520]   In other words, there's a God above this king.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.880]   Secondly, verse 16 and 17,
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.520]   "He shall not multiply horses for himself,
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.920]   "nor shall he cause the people to return to Egypt
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.840]   "to multiply horses, since the Lord has said to you,
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.440]   "You shall not again return that way.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.560]   "He shall not multiply wives for himself,
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.280]   "or else his heart will turn away,
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.720]   "nor shall he greatly increase silver and gold for himself."
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.920]   Let me stop right there.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:29.880]   Well, what's the benefit of being a king?
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.160]   I mean, you would think that if you're the king of the world,
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.360]   king of the country, of course you're gonna have
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.240]   wealth beyond everybody else.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.360]   But God says you will not multiply your wife.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.520]   You will not multiply the horses.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:49.900]   So this king was, in a sense, he was an under shepherds,
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.860]   because it didn't belong to him.
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:58.080]   I mean, what king, what king has these kind of restrictions?
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.540]   If you're the king, you're the owner of the palace.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:02.000]   If you're the king, you're the owner
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.640]   of every possession in that land.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.960]   But he said to the king of Israel,
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:10.960]   "You shall not have many horses, or silver, or gold."
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.640]   So, you know, people often ask,
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.760]   you know, look at King Solomon.
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.440]   He had many wives, and God was not pleased with him.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.160]   You have to be careful that we don't extrapolate
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.480]   things that are happening in narratives and say,
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.840]   "Well, God is okay with it."
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.620]   No, God clearly spelled out he is not okay with it,
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:33.520]   and part of Solomon's sin was he went astray,
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.960]   and he disobeyed God.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.600]   He goes on in verse 18, "Now it shall come about
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.240]   when he sits on the throne of the kingdom,
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:43.480]   he shall write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.960]   in the presence of the Levitical priests."
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:51.040]   So even the law itself, the king didn't create the laws.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.380]   God gave him the laws.
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:56.680]   So he couldn't, he couldn't be, he couldn't will himself,
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.160]   he had to be chosen.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.680]   He couldn't get many wives,
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.160]   or he couldn't become wealthy for himself.
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:06.280]   And even the law, he couldn't create the laws.
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.080]   God would give him the laws.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.960]   This doesn't even sound like a king.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.160]   But he said, "The nation of Israel,
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.300]   because you're asking for a king."
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:17.980]   He said, "I'm gonna give a king to you,
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:21.240]   but this king is going to be an under-shepherd."
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:25.120]   And then verse 20, "The reason for all of this
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.580]   is that his heart may not be lifted up above his countrymen."
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:31.140]   Think about that statement.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.280]   So that the king may remain humble
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.540]   like the rest of the subjects.
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:45.140]   The king, so that the king of Israel will not become proud
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.680]   and he thinks that he is somehow better than the subjects.
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:53.220]   Compare that to any other king,
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:56.900]   even the king of the smallest country in the world.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:01.100]   Even the most insignificant,
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.380]   a country that you've never heard of,
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.740]   if you say he's the king of that country,
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:07.340]   you would automatically assume he's the richest guy,
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:10.100]   he's the most powerful guy, he's the most honored guy.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:14.080]   And yet the kingdom of Israel, he says,
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.460]   "So that your heart may not be lifted above his countrymen
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:18.780]   and that he may not turn aside from the commandments
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.180]   to the right or to the left,
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:23.340]   so that he and his sons may continue long in his kingdom
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.020]   in the midst of Israel."
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:31.140]   So Israelites' kingdom was unlike any other kingdom
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.100]   because there was only one true king.
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:38.420]   And all the other kings in Israel's history
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:41.220]   were supposed to represent the true king.
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.740]   And God put limitations on them.
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.620]   And one of the limitations that he put
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:48.900]   is that the king could not be a priest.
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:55.180]   He is not, he wasn't allowed to occupy both offices.
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:58.420]   We see in 1 Samuel chapter 13,
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:01.060]   King Saul breaks that commandment
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.820]   and as a result of that, he loses his kingdom.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:07.060]   We also see that in 2 Chronicles chapter 26,
[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:12.060]   King Uzziah, King Uzziah becomes a great king.
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:17.700]   And as a result of that, of all of his accomplishment,
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.780]   it says in chapter 26, verse 16,
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.180]   that he became powerful.
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:24.460]   And then when he became powerful, he became proud.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:26.260]   And as a result of this pride,
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:30.100]   he said his kingdom was going to be lost.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:31.060]   Just like he said.
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:34.740]   In fact, we see a clear picture
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.780]   of what kind of king Israelites had
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.340]   in 2 Samuel chapter 12.
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:39.580]   Remember King David?
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:42.460]   He commits this horrendous sin.
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.140]   He commits adultery.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:45.460]   He takes someone else's wife
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:48.580]   and in order to cover that up, he murders him.
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:50.540]   This is a man after God's own heart.
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:55.660]   Now, in any other nation, any other king,
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:59.860]   that would have been perfectly fine.
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:02.500]   As outrageous as that may be,
[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.620]   who's going to contest him?
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.700]   Who's going to call him out?
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:06.540]   He's the king.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:08.740]   He could just come out and say,
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.060]   "You're my wife today," and that's it.
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.340]   Because he makes the laws.
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.660]   All the wives are going to be my wives.
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:16.940]   Who's going to say anything?
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:18.460]   He's the king.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:19.780]   He could take their land.
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.260]   He could take their wives.
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.740]   'Cause he's the most powerful.
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:25.060]   But in the nation of Israel,
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:29.060]   the kings were not like the other nations.
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:31.740]   That's why when the prophet Nathan comes
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.300]   and confronts him about his sin
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:35.820]   in 2 Samuel chapter 12,
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:40.740]   David couldn't do anything other than repent.
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:43.900]   'Cause he recognized his sin.
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.340]   And what's interesting about the way he repents
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:48.420]   is Psalm 51 verse 34 says,
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:50.020]   "For I know my transgressions
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:52.020]   "and my sin is ever before me."
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:56.140]   'Cause he knew that there was a king above him.
[01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:58.900]   "Against you and you only I have sinned
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:01.020]   "and done what is evil in your sight."
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:06.780]   Now that seems like a completely immoral thing to say.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:08.500]   'Cause he committed adultery.
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.340]   He killed a man who was faithful to him.
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:13.540]   And yet when he repents, he says,
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:17.100]   "You only I have sinned and done what is evil."
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.340]   What are you talking about?
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:21.220]   You sinned against your kingdom.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:23.820]   You sinned against Bathsheba.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:25.660]   You sinned against her husband.
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:29.740]   What do you mean only you I have sinned?
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:32.340]   Now he's not saying that I'm innocent of his blood
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.460]   and I'm innocent of adultery.
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.220]   He's not saying that.
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.780]   But as the king of Israel,
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:41.580]   the only law that he broke is God's law.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:43.900]   Because he was the king.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:48.540]   And that's why he was saying, "I've broken your law."
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:52.380]   As a king, I could do whatever I want.
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:57.380]   But as the king of Israel, I've sinned against you.
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:02.140]   See, Israelites kings were not like any other kings.
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:05.260]   God establishes kingdom.
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:09.700]   God established kingship and authority,
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.860]   even in the secular world for the purpose
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:13.740]   of carrying out punishment for evil.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.820]   That's what it says in Romans chapter 13.
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:17.340]   And that's why we are called to submit
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.060]   to those who are in authority.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:21.380]   See, the priesthood was given
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:23.300]   in order to reconcile sinners to God.
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.940]   So the kings were to carry out the law.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.540]   They couldn't create the law,
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:31.180]   but they were to carry out the law that God gave them.
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:34.460]   The priest existed so that when they broke the law,
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:35.900]   that there would be a remedy.
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:40.340]   And God said that these two offices cannot come together.
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:42.340]   Now, why is that?
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.540]   Why did God do that?
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:47.020]   Now I'm gonna get to that in a minute.
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:51.980]   But Jesus fulfills what he prohibited
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:53.300]   in the nation of Israel,
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.900]   because the kings were under shepherds
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.500]   and the priests were also under shepherds.
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.100]   And he kept these two things separate
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:06.060]   because it was reserved for Jesus and Jesus alone.
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.220]   So when he says Jesus comes
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.380]   in the priesthood of Melchizedek,
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:14.860]   he's saying that Jesus is also king and priest,
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:17.420]   which was not allowed in the nation of Israel.
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.780]   When Jesus came and he said,
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:21.980]   "I did not come to abolish the law,
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:23.660]   "but I came to fulfill the law."
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.220]   To fulfill the law means two things.
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:27.420]   One, he obeyed it completely.
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.740]   Whatever God told him to do, he did it completely.
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:32.060]   But secondly, what it means to fulfill
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.620]   is to take it to completion.
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:36.460]   That whatever God gave him the law,
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:40.140]   what his intent was, he said it pointed to him.
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:43.740]   And so he came to fulfill the prophecy
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:48.300]   that your Messiah is going to come as a king priest.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:50.340]   So Jesus came to fulfill that law.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:52.060]   In Zechariah 6:13,
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:54.640]   "Yes, it is he who will build the temple of the Lord
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.240]   "and he who will bear the honor
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.260]   "and sit and rule on his throne."
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.240]   In other words, he's going to be the king.
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:04.320]   "Thus he will be a priest on his throne,
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:07.640]   "which other kings were punished for doing."
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.460]   But he said, "Your Messiah is going to come
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:10.980]   "as a priest on his throne."
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.140]   And the counsel of the peace
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.620]   will be between the two offices.
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.300]   In other words, he says when the Messiah has come,
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.660]   he's going to bring those two offices together.
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:21.500]   The only other place Melchizedek is mentioned
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.740]   in Psalm 110, verse four,
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:25.800]   "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind,
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.740]   "you are a priest forever
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:30.940]   "according to the order of Melchizedek."
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:35.620]   Now why is this so significant?
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:39.380]   Imagine.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.900]   And I think hopefully this will help out.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:46.980]   Imagine if Jesus was just king
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:52.440]   and his role is to carry out justice.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.140]   Where would you and I be?
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:12:00.180]   We wouldn't be here.
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:03.660]   'Cause we all broke the law.
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:08.060]   So if Jesus is king of kings and Lord of lords,
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:10.300]   you and I would be crushed.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.400]   We have no opportunity.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:16.120]   It is not a throne of grace that we approach.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.320]   It's just the throne.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.600]   And when you approach the throne,
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.620]   a God who is holy, holy, holy,
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:25.720]   just like everything in the tabernacle said,
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.200]   if you come with any sin,
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.600]   if you're tainted in any way,
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.720]   if there's any disobedience in you,
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.720]   you will be consumed by my holy wrath.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.400]   If Jesus was only king,
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.380]   you and I have no hope.
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:43.900]   But he's not just king.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:44.740]   He embraced priesthood.
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:46.920]   And the purpose of priesthood
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.580]   was to reconcile sinners to God.
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:54.000]   But if priests,
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.600]   priests never, they didn't carry out the punishment.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:59.340]   Kings did that 'cause they were the ones
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.320]   who were in authority.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.140]   The priests were always receiving the gifts
[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:03.420]   and to reconcile, we're all reconciled.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:04.580]   Your sins are forgiven.
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:07.580]   Now, if Jesus was only priest,
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:12.700]   which many people forget that he is also king,
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:15.420]   and we only see him as a mediator
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.420]   who's always mediating for us,
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:21.060]   one saved, always saved,
[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.100]   and our sins are always forgiven,
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:25.140]   it doesn't matter what we do
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:29.180]   because all we see him as is a priest.
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:33.780]   And so because only see him as a priest,
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:34.980]   there is no lordship.
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:37.740]   It's not necessary because they don't know him as king.
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:41.300]   The Bible tells us
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:45.360]   that Jesus Christ came to fulfill
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.100]   that office that was reserved for him and him alone.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:52.260]   He was king priest,
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:54.580]   and he was king priest perfectly.
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:58.140]   In Psalm 110, verses one through four,
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:59.820]   the Lord says to my lord,
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:02.100]   sit at my right hand until I make your enemies
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.900]   a footstool for your feet.
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:06.340]   The Lord will stretch forth your strong scepter
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:09.900]   from Zion, saying, rule in the midst of your enemies.
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:13.180]   In other words, you're going to be established as a king.
[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:17.180]   Your people will volunteer freely in the day of your power.
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:20.960]   In other words, your kingship,
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.940]   you're not gonna rule in fear.
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:25.060]   You're not gonna rule in judgment.
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.780]   You're not gonna carry out justice
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:28.940]   because you're going to slap them.
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:30.300]   He said, they're gonna come to you
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.900]   because you're also the priest.
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:36.580]   And he said, they're gonna offer up worship to you freely.
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:39.740]   So his kingdom is unlike any other kingdom.
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:42.340]   He's not just a king, he's also the priest.
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.940]   And the way he reconciled us to himself,
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.420]   he's absorbed our sins upon him
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:50.020]   before he sat on his throne.
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:54.300]   You know, I heard a great illustration this week
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:56.720]   about what happens.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.280]   In order to make something clean,
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.060]   you have to make something unclean.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.940]   Just like we're trying to sanitize everything,
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:07.440]   and in order to do that, we have to pick up a rag.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.900]   And you don't use dirty rags if you want to clean things.
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:11.420]   You take a clean rag,
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.700]   and then you take the dirty surface,
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.460]   and then you wipe it down.
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:18.620]   And so when you wipe it down, the surface becomes clean,
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:19.800]   but where's the dirt?
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.680]   It's on the rag.
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.820]   So the rag that was clean is made unclean
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.580]   in order to make the surface clean.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.360]   The Bible describes our priest king.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.740]   In order to make us righteous
[01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:39.880]   so that we may dwell in his kingdom,
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.500]   he absorbed our sins upon himself.
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:46.380]   He who knew no sin became sin
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:50.020]   so that you and I may become the righteous in the face of God.
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.240]   That is his kingdom.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:57.160]   Imagine why this king-priest office is so important.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.020]   This may not be a perfect illustration,
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:04.980]   but imagine, imagine if you got into trouble, right?
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:07.880]   Genuinely got into trouble, and you got taken to jail,
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:11.860]   and the public defender comes,
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:16.220]   and he wants to have a conversation with you,
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:17.660]   and then somebody whispers in your ear,
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:21.020]   and he says, "Hey, he's also the DA."
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:25.340]   Now you're confused.
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:28.780]   He's a public defender, 'cause public defender,
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:30.260]   I'm supposed to tell him what's going on
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:31.760]   so that he could defend me.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.900]   DA is my enemy.
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:38.180]   If I tell him all my sins,
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:40.300]   I'm gonna go to jail for a long time.
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:43.700]   But the guy who's defending me is also the DA.
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:48.820]   Now, they will never let that happen.
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:51.200]   They will never let that happen,
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.860]   because those two offices are contradicting,
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:01.460]   because no human being can carry out the public defense
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:03.960]   and DA at the same time,
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:08.780]   because we're gonna be prejudiced in one way or the other.
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:12.100]   Either you're not gonna do a good job as a DA,
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:13.220]   and say, "You know what, I'm gonna pretend
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:15.240]   "like I never heard your sin,
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.520]   "and I'm just gonna defend you,
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:19.780]   "and I'm gonna do a great job, I'm gonna let you go."
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:21.480]   Or you're a public defender,
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:25.420]   and I heard all your sins,
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:26.940]   you told me everything,
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:32.780]   but no human being is able to be a public defender
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:34.800]   and DA at the same time.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:41.820]   Only a being who has perfect judgment,
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:45.500]   who has perfect knowledge,
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:50.060]   who himself is not tainted with prejudice himself,
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:53.860]   who is able to carry out perfect justice
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:58.140]   and perfect grace at the same time,
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:03.140]   and there is no human being that can ever be in that role.
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:08.140]   That's why it was prohibited for kings and the priests
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:10.420]   to, that those two offices would mix,
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:12.520]   because no human being can carry that out.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:19.020]   Only Jesus, only Jesus can carry that out perfectly.
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:26.900]   A holy, holy, holy God who knows all things,
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:29.580]   who judges all things,
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.540]   loves us unconditionally,
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:36.080]   because of the love of his son, Jesus Christ,
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.300]   his blood covers us.
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:42.540]   That's the king that we worship.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:47.480]   That's the mediator that stands before us.
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:53.820]   Our DA, our public defender, is the same person.
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:19:00.380]   Where he doesn't sweep our sins under the rug,
[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:03.000]   he doesn't allow chaos to happen,
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.440]   he doesn't tolerate the sin,
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:09.160]   the kingdom that we are headed to is not anarchy,
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.780]   where people do whatever they want.
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:15.140]   There is order, there is righteousness,
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:19.180]   but there's also peace, there's also grace,
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:22.700]   because we have a king who comes
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.860]   in the order of Melchizedek.
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:30.540]   Why would we want to drift and replace him
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:31.720]   with anything else?
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:36.380]   Why would we want to go to any other kingdom?
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:40.420]   Why would we put our confidence in any other leader,
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:41.720]   in any other mediator?
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:45.860]   That's the point that he's trying to get to,
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:48.980]   and that's why this is the meat of Hebrews.
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:52.520]   Let's pray.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:20:03.020]   Father,
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:07.960]   what we know of you,
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:12.960]   we know, Father God, that we're like children,
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:18.340]   trying to understand this vast world,
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:21.960]   even a glimpse of your glory.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:26.660]   And we know, Father God, we are so far
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:29.420]   from really understanding who you are.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:33.180]   But we thank you for your patience
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.660]   as we wrestle through the deep things that you've given us.
[01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:41.300]   I pray that this truth of who Christ is
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:43.420]   will not just remain with us with good thoughts
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:44.860]   and good feelings.
[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:48.980]   Help us, Lord God, to be good subjects,
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:52.420]   to establish you as our king,
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:55.820]   Lord of lords and king of kings,
[01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:58.860]   that this throne that you've established,
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:00.060]   the throne of grace,
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:03.620]   that we may not observe it and point to it
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:06.340]   and just admire it from a distance,
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:11.160]   but that we may come in confidence,
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:15.120]   that we may find help in times of trouble,
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.760]   when we need answers, that you are the one that we turn to,
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.700]   where we want refuge, Lord God,
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:27.380]   that we do not give into our fleshy pleasures.
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:30.140]   Teach us how to pray.
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:33.520]   Teach us how to come before you,
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.780]   that our love for you may grow
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:40.560]   as we see a greater and greater glimpse of your glory.
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:43.420]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
