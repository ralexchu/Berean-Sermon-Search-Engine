[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   If you look at the bottom from the front page of our program, we'll give you the fourfold
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.960]   vision.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.460]   Our vision of bringing community to church is to glorify God by establishing a church
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.940]   that engages in God-centered worship and not man-centered, two, a church that equips every
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.220]   believer with God's inerrant word, three, a church that builds a community through love
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.400]   and accountability, and four, a church that reaches out to its community with the gospel
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.400]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.740]   Let's pray.
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.160]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for your goodness.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.560]   We thank you for your patience, your endurance, your love that pursues us, Lord God, while
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.620]   we struggle, Lord, to maintain focus.
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.780]   We thank you, Father God, for your grace, and by your grace alone, Lord, that we're
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.260]   able to come here and worship you, to call you our Abba Father.
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.100]   Help us, Lord, to never take these things for granted, but in view of your mercy, that
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.980]   we would give our bodies as a living sacrifice, that we may live lives truly worthy of the
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.140]   gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.100]   We pray for your blessing and the power of your Holy Spirit to lead us this morning.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.100]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.100]   Amen.
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.220]   >> Some of you guys may have read or been following the news about the six foreigners
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.660]   in Indonesia that got executed this week.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.620]   Some of you guys may have heard of it, some of you may have read it.
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.640]   Basically what happened about six years ago, this bunch of foreigners got caught smuggling
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.300]   drugs in and out of Indonesia, and their punishment a couple years ago was that they were going
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.820]   to be executed.
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.740]   And so it was big international news, so Australia, from different places from different countries
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.060]   were trying to get them to stop that, and Indonesia went ahead and did it, and they
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.940]   spared one lady, and everyone else got executed by the firing squad.
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.300]   Well, you may have heard the news, but one of the men who got executed this week, his
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.140]   name was Andrew Chan, and he's from Australia.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.900]   And the reason why he was somebody that I took notice of was because he was a confessing
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.020]   Christian who was actually evangelizing to the others who were sentenced to death.
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.020]   And he ended up bringing the Gospel to the people in jail, and there was a big talk about
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.620]   him and his fervency for the Lord, and obviously many people were praying for him to be released.
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.020]   An Australian pastor, one of the pastors for Hillsong in Australia, reached out to him,
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.740]   was meeting with him on a regular basis, and he basically gave his testimony before he
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.580]   passed, before he was executed, about his conversion.
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.700]   And at the latter part of it, obviously a lot of people were praying for him, and he
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.780]   spoke specifically about a day when he had to go into court, knowing that the possible
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.300]   sentence would be execution.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.740]   And so obviously he's been praying for that.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.660]   But let me read you an excerpt from what he says.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.500]   And this is from Andrew Chan.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.420]   Just before my court date, where he would receive the death penalty, I remember reading
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.300]   Mark 11, 23-24, where it says that, "If you have enough faith, you can say to this mountain,
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.020]   'Be removed,' and God will do it."
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.540]   So I said, "God, if you're real, and if this is true, I want you to free me.
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.780]   And if you do, I'll serve you every day for the rest of my life."
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.620]   I went to my court hearing, and they convicted me and gave me the death penalty.
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.440]   When I got back to my cell, I said, "God, I asked you to set me free, not kill me."
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.980]   God spoke to me and said, "Andrew, I have set you free from the inside out.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.900]   I have given you life."
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.340]   From that moment on, I haven't stopped worshiping him.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.020]   I had never sung before, never led worship, until Jesus set me free.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.180]   What a powerful testimony of a man who was sentenced to death and was actually executed
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.620]   this week.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.180]   But his testimony in prison was he recognized that it wasn't his physical freedom that was
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.420]   really what he was seeking after.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.660]   God set him free spiritually.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.300]   And now that he's free, now he's able to worship God.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.180]   And again, I was reading this, and again, it's the power of the gospel, of why you and
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.620]   I are here together this morning.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.660]   If we weren't affected by the gospel, we wouldn't be here.
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.060]   I would assume we wouldn't be here.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.180]   You and I are gathered here because something miraculous happened to each Christian, that
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.380]   we were set free.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.700]   It wasn't because God answered our prayer and we got the right job, or we were sick
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.140]   and we became healthy.
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.900]   There was a spiritual sickness in every single one of us, and God set us free from the bondage
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.560]   of living in this fallen world.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.860]   And so, every single person in this room, if you are a follower of Jesus Christ, we
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.500]   are obligated to tell this story to everyone else in this world.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:05.020]   There's a tendency for us to think that the gospel ministry is for pastors, or for missionaries,
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.500]   or a few select people, but that's not your gift, that's not your desire.
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.440]   You have different goals, you're a businessman.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.380]   And so therefore, that is not for me.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.180]   That is completely unbiblical.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.300]   Every single person who has been affected by the cross has been called to the gospel
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.300]   ministry.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.420]   It doesn't mean that everyone's called to the pulpit, not everyone has been called overseas,
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.220]   but there's not a single person who claims to be a follower of Jesus Christ, who's been
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.100]   affected by the cross, who has not been called to the gospel ministry.
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.620]   Paul says in Romans 1, 14-15, "I am under obligation, both to Greeks and to the barbarians,
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.460]   both to the wise and to the foolish, so I am eager to preach the gospel to you also
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.460]   who are in Rome."
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.940]   Paul was not talking about some specific calling because he's an apostle.
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:01.420]   He's talking about his obligation because he is a recipient of that grace.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.580]   If you and I profess to be the recipients of this grace, and to say, "You know what?
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.620]   I believe that Jesus Christ is the answer for man's problem, that there is death and
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.760]   judgment waiting without Christ," and to claim that we believe that, and then not feel any
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.940]   obligation to share this with as many people as possible, there's something wrong with
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.500]   that confession in and of itself.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.540]   Paul again says in 1 Corinthians 9-16, "Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel."
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.980]   He's not just talking about himself as an apostle.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.060]   He's not saying this because he's a missionary.
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.500]   He's saying this because he himself was a recipient of this grace.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.420]   If you study through the Old Testament and the New Testament, the biggest struggle that
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:50.160]   the Israelites had was they thought that they were specifically chosen and blessed by God,
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.620]   and so they had this superiority complex with everybody else.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.020]   We had the law.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.820]   We had, "Whose God is greater than ours?"
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.540]   That all of these things were true, but they completely forgot that God called them to
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.300]   be holy priests.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.180]   They were to be ambassadors to the rest of the world.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.700]   The very beginning, when God called them in Genesis chapter 12, He says, "Through you,
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.940]   I will bless all the other nations."
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.460]   See, but they completely forgot about the latter part of that, that God's going to bless
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.820]   me.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.740]   But then he realized that God blessed them so that the world may be blessed.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.580]   And the whole story of Jonah is...
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.740]   [silence]
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.740]   [silence]

[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.740]   [silence]
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.740]   [silence]

[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.740]   [silence]
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.740]   [silence]
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.740]   [silence]
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.740]   [silence]
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.740]   [silence]
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.740]   [silence]
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.740]   [silence]
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.740]   [silence]
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.740]   [silence]
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.740]   [silence]
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.740]   [silence]
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.740]   [silence]
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.740]   [silence]
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.740]   [silence]
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.740]   [silence]
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.740]   [silence]

[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.740]   [silence]
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.740]   [silence]
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.740]   [silence]

[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.740]   [silence]
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.740]   [silence]
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:12:15.740]   [audience laughter]
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.740]   [audience laughter]
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.740]   [audience laughter]
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.740]   Okay. Dang it, where am I?
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.740]   [audience laughter]
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.740]   Oh, okay. Alright, so.
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.740]   If I came back and gave you the update
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.740]   on what's going on, I didn't mention anything
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.740]   about the gospel ministry, you would ask me
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.740]   like, "What are they doing?"
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.740]   Oh my gosh.
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.740]   Ah. Okay.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.740]   If I told you they went out there
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.740]   and they got caught up and entangled,
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.740]   it's like, "Oh yeah, they forgot about the gospel ministry."
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.740]   And you say, "Well, what was the purpose?"
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.740]   We assume, assume,
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.740]   that if they were commissioned,
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.740]   that that would be what every,
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.740]   everything that they're doing would be centered around this.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.740]   That they got a place
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.740]   where it's going to be the most strategic
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.740]   in reaching the gospel, right?
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.740]   They got a job that's going to help them
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.740]   to share the gospel.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.740]   They're going to make friends, spend time,
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.740]   leisure, whatever they're doing,
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.740]   it's going to be connected to the gospel ministry.
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.740]   See,
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.740]   Jesus left us with this commission,
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.740]   every single one of us.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.740]   I think the problem that we run into is like
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.740]   we expect that from those people who've been commissioned.
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.740]   And if the people
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.740]   who've been commissioned don't live that way,
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.740]   we have a higher standard for it.
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.740]   They don't do that, it's like, "Oh, they disqualify."
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.740]   But why do we think that only the people
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.740]   who've been anointed up on a pulpit
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.740]   and up on a stage have been commissioned?
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.740]   The Great Commission
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.740]   is a commission for everybody.
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.740]   Everybody who claims
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.740]   that Jesus Christ their Lord and Savior
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.740]   has been commissioned to the gospel ministry.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.740]   Why do we not
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.740]   practice the same
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.740]   level of
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.740]   expectation for every
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.740]   Christian? Why is it
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.740]   only a few people that are set apart? Again, that's an
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.740]   unbiblical way of thinking.
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.740]   We have all been commissioned. In fact,
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.740]   there's four things that we're going to be talking about why this is
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.740]   so important in the church. Because
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.740]   we talked about how
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.740]   worship is central to the church.
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.740]   Everything that we do comes from
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.740]   and overflows because of right worship
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.740]   before God. But if we
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.740]   forget the mission of the church, the church
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.740]   becomes just another place to
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.740]   meet friends and raise good children,
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.740]   learn good morals. And it
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.740]   doesn't matter whether you are a follower of Jesus
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.740]   or you're Buddhist, or you go to one
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.740]   church or another, it doesn't matter
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.740]   because in the end, the end goal
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.740]   is raising good children, having good friends.
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.740]   It's just somebody does it in the name of Jesus,
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.740]   somebody does it in the name of Buddha,
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.740]   some atheists are getting together and now they're
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.740]   developing their own church.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.740]   But what is unique
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.740]   about the gospel is that we
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.740]   we are, the message
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.740]   of the cross is not about a better life
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.740]   here. Just
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.740]   like that man, Andrew Chan,
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.740]   what he shared that he realized
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.740]   that his real freedom was not about
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.740]   getting out of jail.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.740]   See, the Great Commission,
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.740]   first and foremost, number one, there's four things
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.740]   I want to share about why this is so important. One,
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.740]   you cannot be a
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.740]   follower of Jesus Christ without being
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.740]   committed to the Great Commission.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.740]   Let me say that again. One,
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.740]   you cannot be a follower of Jesus
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.740]   Christ without being committed to the Great
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.740]   Commission. Coming to church does not
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.740]   make you a Christian. I think you know that.
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.740]   Right? Attending
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.740]   church doesn't make you a Christian. Owning a Bible
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.740]   doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.740]   Even praying doesn't make you a Christian. Didn't you
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.740]   hear, you know,
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.740]   Meriwether yesterday, as soon as he won, he said
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.740]   "Thank you, Lord."
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.740]   He must be a Christian because he said
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.740]   "God." Coming to church
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.740]   doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.740]   When we say we follow Jesus, what
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.740]   do we say basically? We're following. We're going
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.740]   where He's going. Right?
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.740]   Jesus said, "If you want to follow me, you have to pick up
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.740]   your cross because I'm going to the cross.
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.740]   So if you're going to come after me, that's where I'm headed."
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.740]   You
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.740]   can't be a follower of Jesus Christ
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.740]   and be disengaged
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.740]   in the Great Commission. Jesus himself said
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.740]   in Luke 19.10, "For the Son of Man
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.740]   came to seek and to save
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.740]   the lost."
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.740]   That's His primary mission.
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.740]   To seek and save the lost.
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.740]   Matthew 4.19, when He called His disciples,
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.740]   He said, "Follow me and I will
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.740]   make you fishers of men.
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.740]   I'm going to teach you
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.740]   how to reach out to men."
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.740]   In fact, in Matthew 28.19.20,
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.740]   we talk about the Great Commission.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.740]   He begins it by saying, "All
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.740]   authority has been given to me." And then He concludes
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.740]   it by telling them that,
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.740]   "I will be with
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.740]   you to the end of the age."
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.740]   If you take that last part and say,
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.740]   "I will be with you to the end of the age,"
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.740]   and you misapply what Jesus meant,
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.740]   you can use
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.740]   it as a source of comfort.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.740]   You know, when you're struggling, the Lord is with you.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.740]   You know, when you didn't get the job that
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.740]   you wanted, it's like, "Ah, the
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.740]   Lord's so near to me."
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.740]   You know, you didn't get into the school that
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.740]   you wanted. You didn't get the raise.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.740]   You're having marriage problems, but the Lord is near.
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.740]   We're not saying that that's
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.740]   not true, but the primary
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.740]   context in which He says that
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.740]   is in the context of making
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.740]   disciples. Because
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.740]   He's sending disciples out to a hostile
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.740]   world.
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.740]   And so they said, "They're not going to welcome you. They're going to
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.740]   persecute you." And so He's encouraging,
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.740]   "Don't worry. All authority has been given to
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.740]   me. You're afraid of their authority,
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.740]   but don't worry. That authority is under
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.740]   my authority." And
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.740]   you go out and make disciples in that context
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.740]   while you are going out, don't forget,
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.740]   I am with you to the end of the age.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.740]   His comfort
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.740]   to be with us is in the
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.740]   context of the Great Commission.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.740]   We can't just take that passage and just
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.740]   apply it any way we want.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.740]   You cannot be a follower
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.740]   of Jesus Christ if you are
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.740]   disengaged with the Great Commission.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.740]   If I told you, "Hey, I'm going out
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.740]   over here. How many of you are going to follow me?"
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.740]   All of you raise your hand, and I walk out the door.
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.740]   Only about five of you came with me.
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.740]   I'm going to run back and say, "I thought
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.740]   you guys wanted to follow me." He said, "Yeah, I want to be
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.740]   a follower because I wanted to
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.740]   be named a follower, but I'm not sure
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.740]   if I'm going to actually go where you went."
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.740]   Right?
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.740]   That's not what I meant when I said I wanted to
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.740]   follow you. When I said I wanted to follow you, it
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.740]   means, like, I like you.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.740]   Right? I like you,
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.740]   and I want to be your friend.
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.740]   But when I said I want to be
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.740]   your follower, I didn't mean to actually
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.740]   follow you.
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.740]   What do you think Jesus meant? He said, "When
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.740]   you come after me." Anybody who comes after me,
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.740]   anybody who follows me, has to
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.740]   pick up his cross. What did He mean by that?
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.740]   To go where He went.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.740]   To do what He does. To say
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.740]   what He says.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.740]   That's what He means by, "Be a follower of
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.740]   Jesus Christ." He didn't say, "Come follow me
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.740]   to attend church."
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.740]   You can't be
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.740]   a follower of Jesus Christ because
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.740]   this is at the core of His heart.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.740]   He came to seek and save
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.740]   the lost.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.740]   In fact, the whole reason why
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.740]   He gave the Holy Spirit
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.740]   was for the purpose of the Great Commission.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.740]   Remember the disciples?
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.740]   Jesus tells the disciples, "Where I go, you
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.740]   cannot come." The disciples are
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.740]   freaking out. Because they knew
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.740]   that the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.740]   hated Jesus.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.740]   But as long as they were with Jesus,
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.740]   they can go out and preach
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.740]   and heal demons, and they were
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.740]   okay. But Jesus says, "I'm not going to
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.740]   leave you as an orphan. I'm going to send
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.740]   my Helper to you." And this is what He
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.740]   says. This is how He describes why
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.740]   He's sending the Holy Spirit. John
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.740]   14, 26. "But the Helper,
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.740]   the Holy Spirit, whom
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.740]   the Father will send in My name,
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.740]   will teach you all
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.740]   the things and bring to your remembrance
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.740]   all that I have said to you."
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.740]   First of all,
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.740]   what is He a Helper of?
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.740]   Helper of what?
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.740]   Live a hard life.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.740]   I mean, it's a hard life here, right?
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.740]   I mean, the grind of going to work 9-5.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.740]   I mean, is the Holy
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.740]   Spirit sent to help you to live
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.740]   a life that the rest of the world
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.740]   is living, but to make your life easier?
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.740]   The Holy Spirit helping
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.740]   you because it's hard for you to find jobs, so the
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.740]   Holy Spirit is going to help you?
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.740]   Or maybe you're in
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.740]   some sort of athletic competition, and
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.740]   the Holy Spirit is going to empower you
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.740]   to help you?
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.740]   What does He mean by Helper?
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.740]   What is He helping us
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.740]   to do? He said He's going to
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.740]   come, He's going to teach you, and He's
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.740]   going to cause you to remember all that I have said to
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.740]   you. For what purpose? Why is the
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.740]   Helper helping us to remember
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.740]   what Jesus said? So that
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.740]   you can say, "Oh, okay,
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.740]   I remember that." Right? You have a
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.740]   very good memory because you're filled with the
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.740]   Holy Spirit. Right?
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.740]   He said, "No, I'm going to cause you to remember it." For what purpose?
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.740]   So that you can say what I said.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.740]   You can tell them
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.740]   what I told you.
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.740]   That you can repeat what I've said to you,
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.740]   what I've said to these people, so that you
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.740]   can also proclaim it. That's what the Holy
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.740]   Spirit's going to come to do.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.740]   Again, in John 15, 26,
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.740]   "But when the Helper comes,
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.740]   whom I will send to you from the Father, the
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.740]   Spirit of Truth, who proceeds from the
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.740]   Father, He will bear witness about me."
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.740]   So what is the
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.740]   power of the Holy Spirit?
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.740]   It's for the purpose of the Great Commission.
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.740]   Acts chapter
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.740]   118, you guys know that.
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.740]   Right? The Holy
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.740]   Spirit came
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.740]   because without the Holy Spirit they were powerless.
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.740]   It's like the
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.740]   disciples before Jesus went to the cross,
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.740]   they had
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.740]   every intention, they had every
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.740]   desire to remain faithful,
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.740]   but they did not. They failed utterly.
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.740]   After the Resurrection,
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.740]   the Holy Spirit,
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.740]   Jesus says, "You're going to be my witnesses,
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.740]   but only when the Holy
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.740]   Spirit comes upon you,
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.740]   and you will be my witnesses
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.740]   in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.740]   to the ends of the earth." So why
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.740]   is the Holy Spirit coming? What is the
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.740]   role of the Holy Spirit in your life?
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.740]   To
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.740]   empower us. If you study
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.740]   pneumatology, if you study about the
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.740]   Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.740]   always equated with power.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.740]   That's why I always say,
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.740]   if you speak,
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.740]   and the Holy Spirit is there, there's power
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.740]   in it. It's not in how well we
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.740]   articulate something. It's not about
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.740]   our talent or money, experience.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.740]   It's the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.740]   Right? But the
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.740]   whole purpose of the Holy Spirit is to give us
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.740]   power to be a witness
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.740]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.740]   So we can say, "Oh, I want
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.740]   to be filled with the Holy Spirit." It's not simply to
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.740]   comfort you because life is hard.
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.740]   The power of the Holy Spirit is not so that
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.740]   we can get along with each other.
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.740]   The power of the Holy Spirit is so
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.740]   that we can take the light into
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.740]   the darkness.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.740]   So if we are not engaged in the
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.740]   Great Commission, what power
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.740]   do you need? Why do you need power? What do you need power
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.740]   for? The whole world
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.740]   knows how to get jobs.
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.740]   If you want to be excellent in
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.740]   athletic competition,
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.740]   first you have to be athletic,
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.740]   and second, you have to
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.740]   train, just like everybody else.
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.740]   You don't sit there and say, "Holy Spirit,
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.740]   I need your power so I can win
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.740]   this basketball game.
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.740]   Holy Spirit, I need this power so that I can get
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.740]   this good job. Holy Spirit,
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.740]   I need this power so I can have a good marriage."
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.740]   Right?
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.740]   The whole world is doing it without. What do you
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.740]   need the power of the Holy Spirit for?
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.740]   Right? We are all just weak people
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.740]   that what the world is doing
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.740]   fine without.
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.740]   Holy Spirit was given to us
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.740]   because it is a spiritual battle.
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.740]   And it must be one
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.740]   spiritual. That's why we are given the Holy
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.740]   Spirit. So the whole role of the Holy Spirit
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.740]   is irrelevant to an individual
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.740]   who is not engaged in the Great Commission.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.740]   Even
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.740]   their content of prayer.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.740]   Why is prayer so
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.740]   ineffective? Why is
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.740]   prayer so inefficient or
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.740]   impotent in the Western Church?
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.740]   Because
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.740]   the very core of
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.740]   prayer is for the purpose of
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.740]   the Great Commission. I mean,
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.740]   we engage with God. We fellowship with Him.
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.740]   But every time you see Paul
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.740]   praying, Paul is praying
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.740]   that the Gospel may spread.
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.740]   In Colossians 4, 2-4.
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.740]   "Continue steadfastly in prayer, being
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.740]   watchful in it with thanksgiving.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.740]   At the same time, pray also for us
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.740]   that God may open to us a door for the Word.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.740]   Declare the mystery of Christ,
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.740]   on account of which I am in prison,
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.740]   that I may make it clear which is how I ought
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.740]   to speak." I'm not going to go through all the
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.740]   passages where Paul speaks about
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.740]   asking for prayer, but almost
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.740]   every instance he asks for prayer.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.740]   He's praying for the power of the Gospel
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.740]   to go forth.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.740]   Even our
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.740]   prayers are ineffective when
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.740]   we are not abiding. He says, "If you
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.740]   abide in my Word,"
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.740]   right? "If you abide in me
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.740]   and my words abide in you, ask
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.740]   whatever you wish, it shall be done for you."
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.740]   You can't skip through the middle part and say,
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.740]   "Ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you."
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.740]   He has a condition for prayer.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.740]   He has a condition
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.740]   for effective prayer.
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.740]   It's not just, "Life is hard,
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.740]   Lord, I need your help."
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.740]   Not to say that God doesn't care.
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.740]   God cares.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.740]   But the reason why we need
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.740]   His power, we need,
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.740]   why we need the Holy Spirit
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.740]   is because we are abiding in Him.
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.740]   And we're following Him.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.740]   And we can't do it by our
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.740]   own strength.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.740]   In Matthew 9,
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.740]   Jesus saw
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.740]   the multitude. He has compassion on them.
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.740]   And what did He say? He turned around and told His disciples.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.740]   He said, "Hey, get better trained."
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.740]   Is that what He said?
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.740]   "Get better organized." "Hey, we need
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.740]   some more funding. We need to send these
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.740]   people to the right school." What did He say?
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.740]   He said, "Get on your knees and pray.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.740]   Pray that the
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.740]   Lord of the harvest will send out more workers."
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.740]   You know,
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.740]   I think the greatest lesson that I learned
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.740]   about prayer was through a lady
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.740]   that I met named Amy.
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.740]   The first time I went to China in '93.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.740]   She was a prayer warrior.
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.740]   You know, every morning we would get together
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.740]   and we would have breakfast and she would be gone
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.740]   more than half the time.
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.740]   So the first week, I didn't know her.
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.740]   So first thing I thought, "Wow, she's not waking up."
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.740]   You know, she'd rather sleep than to eat.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.740]   And after about a week and a half,
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.740]   I was there for about 31 days, and after about
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.740]   a week and a half, I realized that she was not
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.740]   coming out because she was fasting.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.740]   And she was praying. So once I realized
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.740]   what she was doing, I was like, "Wow,
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.740]   this lady is a prayer warrior."
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.740]   And I would say more than half of the
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   meals while we were there. And I think
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.740]   at that period of time in China, China was not
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.740]   open to receive missionaries and
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.740]   you still had soldiers walking out
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.740]   on the streets. So it was a pretty intense place
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.740]   to be a missionary. She was actually
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.740]   praying to come into that country within
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.740]   the next couple years.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.740]   And so she was praying over the country.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.740]   And so obviously,
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.740]   I was really encouraged by her.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.740]   And I remember we were on a plane ride,
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.740]   and I was asking her about, like, you know,
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.740]   about prayer. "How do you pray?
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.740]   What's the most effective way to pray?"
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.740]   And she said, "Typically,
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.740]   when a lot of people pray,
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.740]   the biggest problem that we have in our prayer,
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.740]   why our prayers are so weak, is because
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.740]   our prayers are always defensive.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.740]   And our prayers oftentimes
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.740]   reveal our theology
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.740]   and our lack of faith."
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.740]   She said, "We're always praying
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.740]   for better health,
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.740]   praying for better jobs,
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.740]   praying for protection. Even when we go on to missions, we pray
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.740]   for protection, that we don't get sick."
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.740]   And she says,
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.740]   "I'm not saying that's wrong, but the
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.740]   main content of our prayer should be offensive.
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.740]   That God
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.740]   would open doors, or the gospel may be preached,
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.740]   that the light may shine in darkness,
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.740]   and the people who are in darkness
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.740]   would come into the light and know Jesus."
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.740]   And she said,
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.740]   "Our prayer should be, 'God, give me
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.740]   strength to run into
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.740]   enemy territory and
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.740]   save them.' That should be
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.740]   the content of our prayer."
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.740]   And I remember her saying, "Wow,
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.740]   that was so powerful, because it's so true.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.740]   So much of our prayer is
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.740]   about, 'Lord,
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.740]   maintaining what we've achieved,
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.740]   right,
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.740]   and we're afraid we're going to lose it, whether
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.740]   it's our reputation, our house, our job, our
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.740]   safety, our comfort, or security
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.740]   in the future. And so much of our prayer
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.740]   is holding on with dear life to
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.740]   the things that we've earned, or we think we've
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.740]   earned, and how much
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.740]   of it is His heart,
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.740]   His mission,
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.740]   His will. How much of our
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.740]   prayer actually abides in
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.740]   Christ and His Word?"
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.740]   And I think one of the main reasons
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.740]   why our prayers are so difficult is because
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.740]   we're fighting against His will.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.740]   You know, we're trying to
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.740]   bend His will so that
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.740]   my will will be His will.
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.740]   See, even our
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.740]   very prayer is directly connected
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.740]   to the Great Commission.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.740]   Thirdly,
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.740]   the Church,
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.740]   the very essence of the Church
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.740]   was about the Great Commission.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.740]   In Matthew
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.740]   16, 18,
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.740]   you know that passage well,
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.740]   where we talked about it last
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.740]   week, where Jesus says, "I will build
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.740]   my Church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.740]   against it." If you look at that text,
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.740]   for years, I thought
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.740]   that was a defensive text. The gates
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.740]   of Hades, we're in this gate, and
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.740]   Hades cannot come in.
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.740]   If you look at that text closely, you'll
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.740]   find that it is not a defensive,
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.740]   it is an offensive. He says
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.740]   the gates of Hades.
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.740]   See, who's in the gate?
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.740]   Hades. And who's the one
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.740]   trying to break through? The Church.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.740]   He says the Church
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.740]   is going to be established, and the gates
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.740]   of Hades will not be able to stand in its
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.740]   way. That's what He means by that.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.740]   The Church was never meant to
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.740]   be a fortress,
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.740]   and ask, "Lord, protect us from the
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.740]   evil. Protect us from
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.740]   the world. Protect
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.740]   us when we get hurt. Protect us from
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.740]   sickness." He says, "No."
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.740]   God called us to be soldiers,
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.740]   to
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.740]   run into enemy's territory. In fact,
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.740]   the very reason why we
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.740]   don't experience persecution is
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.740]   because we're disengaged sometimes with the
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.740]   Great Commission.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.740]   Many of you read
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.740]   my post on Facebook, because I got an email from
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.740]   one of our contacts out in India
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.740]   that five
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.740]   Christians, and these were not specifically
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.740]   pastors, they were lay people who had been trained
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.740]   to go share the Gospel and make disciples.
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.740]   They were targeted
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.740]   by a group called
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.740]   RSS. And they
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.740]   were basically the Hindu militant group.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.740]   So this was not some random stoning, or
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.740]   random beating. They went to a village and people didn't
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.740]   like it, and so they got beat up.
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.740]   It was a organized,
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.740]   concerted effort to weed out
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.740]   Christianity in that particular area of
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.740]   India, Karnataka. And
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.740]   some of you guys who went to India with us know that Karnataka
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.740]   is where Bellary is. That's the
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.740]   city that we were in. And
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.740]   we didn't go to the extreme areas,
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.740]   but that's basically where this took place.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.740]   Now these
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.740]   Christians could have easily avoided any of that.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.740]   If they just stayed
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.740]   home, got together, and had fellowship,
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.740]   and you know, and had
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.740]   birthday parties, and sang worship
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.740]   songs, and did Bible study.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.740]   Persecution didn't
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.740]   come their way because they were in a house
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.740]   reading the Bible together.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.740]   Persecution comes because they're
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.740]   taking the Gospel to places that
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.740]   don't want it.
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.740]   Persecution doesn't come to people
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.740]   who are sitting in comfort
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.740]   and just paying bills, and doing
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.740]   nice things, and feeding the
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.740]   homeless. You don't get persecuted.
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.740]   You'll be praised for that. The world
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.740]   will give you rewards for that.
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.740]   That you're a great humanitarian.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.740]   In fact, remember I told you, I asked one
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.740]   of the pastors, "How come the Muslims are not being
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.740]   targeted?" And they said, "They don't target them because
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.740]   they don't proselytize. They're
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.740]   not actively out there trying to convert
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.740]   Hindus to the Islamic
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.740]   faith." He said, "Christians are the ones
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.740]   going into the villages and sharing the Gospel.
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.740]   That's why they're being targeted."
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.740]   He said, "When it says
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.740]   2 Timothy 3.12, 'Indeed
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.740]   all who desire to live a godly
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.740]   life in Christ Jesus will be
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.740]   persecuted.'"
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.740]   Now when he says godly life, is he talking about
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.740]   people who are just reading the Bible?
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.740]   Is he talking about people who are gathered together
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.740]   for a little prayer meeting because they want to support
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.740]   each other? Who are participating
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.740]   in small group, accountability group?
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.740]   Is he talking about that?
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.740]   No, when he says godly life,
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.740]   he's talking about people who are engaged
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.740]   in godly work.
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.740]   Who are participating
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.740]   in the Great Commission.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.740]   He says, "You will be persecuted
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.740]   because you're taking a light
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.740]   into the darkness that does not want
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.740]   it." You're going to flip
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.740]   the switch where people have become
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.740]   comfortable living in the darkness and you're going to
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.740]   turn the light on and saying, "This is
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.740]   the only way."
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.740]   So only the people who see
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.740]   the need for the light are going to thank you and
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.740]   everybody else is going to hate you.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.740]   The
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:49.740]   whole church,
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.740]   the reason why God brought us together was for
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.740]   the purpose of being a light. Just like the
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.740]   nation of Israel. He said, "I'm going to bless you
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.740]   so that through you
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.740]   all the other nations
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.740]   may be blessed."
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.740]   If we ask the Lord to bless us with
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.740]   no intention of doing
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.740]   anything else other than to live a comfortable
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.740]   life, how
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.740]   is that different than the nation of Israel?
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.740]   If all we're asking
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.740]   in our prayers, "Keep us safe and healthy
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.740]   for the purpose of being safe
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.740]   and healthy," how is that different than the
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.740]   nation of Israel?
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.740]   It is not that God
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.740]   wants us to be uncomfortable. It is not that God
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.740]   wants us to be persecuted.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.740]   But in the context of the Great Commission,
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.740]   He says He wants
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.740]   us to pray. In fact, Paul,
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.740]   he evaluated
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.740]   success and failure based
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.740]   upon the preaching of the Gospel.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.740]   In fact, Philippians chapter 1, 12-14,
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.740]   as he is sitting in prison,
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.740]   typically if we're healthy,
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.740]   we've got a good job, we have a nice
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.740]   house, and our kids are well behaved,
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.740]   we have a good church, we have good friends,
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.740]   we are blessed.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.740]   But Paul saw blessing
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.740]   completely differently. Philippians 1, 12-14.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.740]   I want you to know, brothers, that what
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.740]   has happened to me has really served
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.740]   to advance the Gospel. He's sitting in prison.
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.740]   So that it has become known throughout
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:07.740]   the whole Imperial Guard and to all
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.740]   the rest that my imprisonment is
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.740]   for Christ.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.740]   And most of the brothers, having become
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.740]   confident in the Lord by my imprisonment,
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.740]   are much more bold to speak the Word
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.740]   without fear.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.740]   He measured success
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.740]   as to how much the Word of God
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.740]   was going, how much the Gospel was being preached.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.740]   Now,
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.740]   I'm going to wrap up here pretty soon.
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:33.740]   But I know that this message is
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.740]   not a comfortable message.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.740]   Because to embrace the Cross
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:39.740]   and to embrace the Commission,
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:41.740]   automatically means
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.740]   it's going to put you in situations
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.740]   where you're uncomfortable.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.740]   Whether it's your co-workers,
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.740]   whether it's your neighbors,
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:51.740]   you're going to end up saying things that you know
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.740]   that people don't want to hear.
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:55.740]   You're going to end up going places that
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:57.740]   are uncomfortable. You know, oftentimes
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.740]   I hear people like, "Man, I can go anywhere but
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.740]   India. You know,
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.740]   it's so foreign, it's so weird.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.740]   I mean, so maybe
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.740]   Bahamas then? You know?
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.740]   Maybe Hawaii? You know,
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.740]   I can see myself going there with the Gospel."
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.740]   No, if you're committed to
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.740]   the Great Commission, you don't go because it's comfortable.
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.740]   You don't go because they have good food
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.740]   and air conditioning. You go because there's a need
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.740]   for the Gospel, period.
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.740]   No matter how uncomfortable
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.740]   it may be. So when we talk
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.740]   about the Great Commission,
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.740]   automatically
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.740]   it'll force us to be
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.740]   uncomfortable. But if
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.740]   every decision we made in life,
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.740]   even why I choose a certain
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.740]   church, is where do I
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.740]   feel the most comfortable?
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.740]   And then all of a sudden we're talking about
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.740]   the Great Commission, taking the light into
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.740]   the darkness. To go into
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.740]   darkness automatically means
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.740]   to get out of your comfort zone.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.740]   So there's this tension.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.740]   How do I embrace the
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.740]   Great Commission when every
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:59.740]   thought that I have for my
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.740]   child, for myself,
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.740]   is safety
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.740]   and comfort?
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.740]   There should be tension.
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.740]   It should make us feel
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.740]   uncomfortable. It should force
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.740]   us to take a step back and ask
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.740]   ourselves, "Am I
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:19.740]   following Christ
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.740]   or is it enough
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.740]   that I threw my name into the
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.740]   list?"
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:29.740]   You know, yesterday,
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.740]   I know a lot of you guys watched Manny
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.740]   Pacquiao, Mayweather
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.740]   fight. And we were
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.740]   looking for it. I was looking for it. I mean,
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.740]   I haven't watched a boxing match in years.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.740]   This is probably the first time being excited about
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.740]   boxing probably since Tyson boxed.
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.740]   Which was a couple years ago.
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.740]   Right? So, yeah, I know
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.740]   a lot of you guys got together in your homes and various
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.740]   places. And especially because
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.740]   you know, remember when Jeremy
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.740]   Lin, when the Jeremy Lin thing
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.740]   was blowing up? And I got so excited because
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.740]   he was an Asian American
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.740]   Christian. And he was very
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.740]   public about his faith. So I was like, "Man,
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.740]   every time they give him an opportunity he is sharing
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.740]   about Christ." And so I remember that
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.740]   summer when we went to China, it was
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.740]   so easy to share the Gospel because
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.740]   you know once you said Jeremy Lin, it's like, "Oh,
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.740]   yeah, they were so interested." I was like, "He lives in
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.740]   California. We live in California." What?
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.740]   [laughter]
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.740]   It was so easy to share the Gospel
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.740]   because he was so public
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.740]   about his faith. And China tried so hard to
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.740]   block his testimony, but almost
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.740]   every news channel was covering him. So
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.740]   that summer it was just so easy to
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.740]   share the Gospel. And that's why I wanted to
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.740]   see him do well.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.740]   Well, Pacquiao, if you've
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.740]   been watching him, hearing him, every
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.740]   opportunity he's got he is mentioning God. In
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.740]   fact in his weigh-in he actually
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.740]   gave a brief testimony.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.740]   You know he said, "Hi, I was a womanizer
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.740]   and did this, but God saved me." And then
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.740]   he actually turned to Manny
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.740]   Merriweather and he said,
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.740]   "It would be great after the fight is over that
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.740]   we have an opportunity I can tell you about God and
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.740]   how we can impact the world." And obviously
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.740]   it was dead silence. You know?
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.740]   [laughter] And I know some of you
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.740]   guys are saying, "Is he just a professing?"
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.740]   Because even Merriweather
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.740]   said, "Oh, thank God
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.740]   after, is he one of those guys?"
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.740]   But if you hear his testimony
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.740]   he's a genuine Christian. He
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.740]   really wants to share the Gospel. So
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.740]   I really wanted him to win
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.740]   because in my mind I was thinking
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.740]   if he wins, I mean you saw the stage
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.740]   yesterday. Like
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.740]   everybody who, somebody who had some money
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.740]   came into town. You're talking about
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.740]   all the movie stars, all the
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.740]   actors, all the whatever,
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.740]   right? Top of the world. And they were showing
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.740]   a picture of the airport and
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.740]   all the private jets.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.740]   Right? And I remember
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.740]   Barclay was talking about how people
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.740]   were calling him, other celebrities
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.740]   were calling him, begging him to help him
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.740]   get tickets. Celebrities couldn't get into this.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.740]   Right? And I was
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.740]   thinking this is probably the biggest stage.
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.740]   This is bigger stage than the President
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.740]   of the United States is going to get.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.740]   And they have all the money. They're all good
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.740]   looking. They're all,
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.740]   these are all top of their
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.740]   fields in every field. Anybody
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.740]   who had access was there.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.740]   And here's a Christian
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.740]   who's talking about his faith. And
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.740]   in my mind I was thinking if he wins,
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.740]   if he wins,
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.740]   think about the platform he's
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.740]   going to have. And I could
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:21.740]   see it already. You know in my mind if he
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.740]   wins, they're going to ask me, "Pakio, what's going on?"
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.740]   I want to thank my Lord Jesus Christ. And he's going to mean it.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.740]   And he's going to say, and they're going
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.740]   to go back his history and how he
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.740]   became a Christian. And everything that
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.740]   happened during Jamerlin's, you know,
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:35.740]   this hysteria, but at a
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.740]   bigger level.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.740]   Obviously it didn't happen.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.740]   And it was disappointing.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.740]   You know, and I
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.740]   remember the last time I felt this disappointed
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.740]   was I think about five or six
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.740]   years ago. Lakers went to the championship
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.740]   and lost the seventh game. I forgot when
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.740]   that was, but I was depressed for
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.740]   a few days. Genuinely
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.740]   depressed, like something was missing.
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.740]   You know?
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.740]   Well this, yesterday
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.740]   it was over. You know, we were all
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.740]   in a giddy mood before the fight
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.740]   that during the fight I was like, "Oh my gosh.
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.740]   What's going on?" And at the end of the fight, it's
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.740]   kind of silent. Nobody's funny.
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.740]   Nobody has any jokes to crack. And I just
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.740]   kind of slipped away and went home. You know?
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.740]   I'm just being
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.740]   honest with you. I was hoping so much
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.740]   for Pacquiao to win.
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.740]   I went home, you know, I was like, I was
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.740]   looking through news to see
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.740]   what's going on. And everything was
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.740]   Pacquiao, Manny, Pacquiao. I didn't want to
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.740]   read it. I turned it off
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.740]   because I didn't want to get depressed. I woke up this morning
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.740]   and looked at it and again, oh, you know,
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.740]   Pacquiao. I was like, "I don't want to read it." Right?
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.740]   And I was
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.740]   just thinking like, in my mind,
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.740]   I was wrestling with, what I, like
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.740]   to me, I was thinking, "Man, it would have been a
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.740]   great opportunity to
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.740]   shine Christ on that stage
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.740]   with everybody watching."
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.740]   And then, you know, the thought I had
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.740]   this morning as I was taking a shower,
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.740]   as I was
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.740]   getting ready to come to church, the thought I had this morning
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.740]   was, "I'll bet you the Jews were
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.740]   thinking the same thing when Jesus came
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.740]   into Jerusalem.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.740]   I'll bet you they were thinking the same thing.
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.740]   That on this stage,
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.740]   with all the Romans, with everybody
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.740]   here, if Jesus would just
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.740]   conquer,
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.740]   you know, if He would just conquer, on
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.740]   this stage, with all these people waiting
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.740]   for Him, if He would just reveal His power
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.740]   now, then He
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.740]   could have the power, then He could restore us,
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.740]   then He could bring glory to God. I'll bet you
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:29.740]   that's what they were thinking.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.740]   But Jesus didn't go there. He didn't go to the stage.
[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.740]   He didn't go to the spotlight. He went
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.740]   to the cross.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.740]   So you can think about the disappointment that people were
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.740]   feeling. I mean, they were there. I mean,
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.740]   they were physically there watching Him.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.740]   You know, it reminded me
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.740]   again of Ephesians 6.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.740]   Our struggle is not
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:49.740]   against flesh and blood.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.740]   That is not the stage in which
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.740]   our Jesus conquered.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.740]   It is in our brokenness.
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.740]   It is in our sorrows.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.740]   It is in our sins.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.740]   Pachael did not
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.740]   glorify Christ on that
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.740]   stage. Where Christ was
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.740]   glorified in Pachael's life
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.740]   is when he repented.
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.740]   It's when he was deep in his sin
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.740]   and he recognized his sin and he came
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.740]   before a holy God.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.740]   That's when our Jesus is glorified.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.740]   See, that stage, that was not Jesus'
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.740]   stage. That's the world.
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.740]   That's what the world works for.
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.740]   That's what the world thinks
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.740]   the end of life is.
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:31.740]   But there's emptiness on that stage.
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.740]   Every single one
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.740]   of us knows the
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.740]   attraction of Christ. What makes this
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.740]   church beautiful is Jesus
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.740]   and what he has done.
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.740]   And what makes your life worthwhile
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.740]   is to proclaim this Jesus
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:47.740]   in the
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.740]   brokenness of the world.
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.740]   In the lostness of our neighbors,
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.740]   our family and friends.
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.740]   We don't need that stage
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.740]   because the Holy
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.740]   Spirit is omnipresent and
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.740]   he's everywhere.
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.740]   My hope and prayer
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.740]   is that this
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.740]   gospel that we proclaim
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.740]   to be so precious
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:11.740]   will be more than just words.
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.740]   That it
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.740]   will not just be our security blanket
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.740]   to help us through the
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.740]   day,
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:21.740]   but that we will be firmly convicted
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.740]   that it is the power of God unto salvation
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.740]   to everyone who believes.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.740]   And that our life
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.740]   would reflect that.
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.740]   Would you take a few minutes to pray with me
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.740]   as I ask the praise team to come back up?
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.740]   Especially for those of you
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.740]   who've been praying for a few people
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.740]   in your lives and you've kind of
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.740]   given up. Because it didn't happen
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.740]   right away.
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.740]   And so you're kind of like,
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.740]   is it useful? Is it for what purpose?
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.740]   And maybe you've kind of gotten tired.
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.740]   I want to encourage you
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.740]   to continue to pray.
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.740]   You know, the
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.740]   prayers that mean the most
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.740]   when it's answered are the ones that we
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.740]   persevere the most.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.740]   So pray. If you've given up
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.740]   on praying for the lost, especially
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.740]   the people that you care about, take some time to pray
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.740]   for them. Pray for your own
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.740]   heart. You've been kind of
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.740]   so focused on your life and how
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.740]   to improve your life and how to make it safe
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.740]   for your children and you've
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.740]   maybe lost a big picture of the Great Commission
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.740]   to come before the Lord and pray, "Lord,
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.740]   I believe.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.740]   Help my unbelief."
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:29.740]   And that God will stir us up again for the Great Commission.
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.740]   Maybe some of you guys may remember that time
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.740]   you went out to missions and how excited you were
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:35.740]   to share the Gospel.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.740]   And maybe you've drifted away from that.
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:39.740]   Remember the height from which you had
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.740]   fallen. Take some time to pray, "Lord, restore
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:43.740]   that passion for the Great Commission."
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.740]   And
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.740]   then maybe there's some people, maybe you've never
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.740]   prayed for them. Maybe there's some people around you,
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.740]   family, friends, co-workers.
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.740]   Pray for them specifically.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:55.740]   Pray that God would open the door that
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.740]   you can share the Gospel.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.740]   So if every decision that you've been making
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.740]   has nothing to do with
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.740]   the Great Commission, that you would take
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.740]   a step back and ask
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.740]   the Lord, "Lord, give me strength
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.740]   that my prayers and my life
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.740]   would be in accordance to you and your life."
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.740]   Let's take some time to pray as our
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.740]   worship team leads us.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:23.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
