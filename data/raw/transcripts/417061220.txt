[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   All right, good morning.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.320]   Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers who are participating today.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.400]   I know especially with the quarantine and all the kids being homeschooled, you're working
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.040]   overtime and so we're praying for you, we're thankful for you.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.880]   And you know, typically when we think about God's agape love, the closest thing that most
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.520]   people can think of is the love that they receive from their mothers.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.520]   And so again, obviously even the mother's love cannot compare to the love that we receive
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.520]   from God the Father.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.040]   But as people, you know, the closest that we typically experience is usually from our
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.040]   mothers.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.800]   So again, we want to thank you for all the hard work that you're putting in, especially
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.880]   now as you're homeschooling, you know, taking care of the home and just working overtime
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.160]   right now more than any other period.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.360]   We do have a special video to celebrate Mother's Day, but we're not going to be watching it
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.640]   online.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.920]   It's going to be put up on Facebook.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.920]   It's a little bit longer than I think normal.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.120]   So after the service or whenever you have time today or even tomorrow, you can just
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.400]   go and just watch that on your own time.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.440]   But again, we do have a special video that our media team created for us.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.160]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles to John chapter 15, and we're actually going to be
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.080]   floating around John chapter, you know, latter part of 14, 15, and then the beginning part
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.200]   of chapter 16.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.000]   But again, we're going to be, there's a lot to cover and I'm not going to be able to cover
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.200]   all of it today.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.440]   This text is so rich with so many good things that Christ was trying to teach them before
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.500]   he left.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.560]   And so, but the main text that we're going to be looking at is starting from verse 1
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560]   through 11.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.680]   So let's read that before we pray and then jump into the sermon.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.040]   I am the true vine and my father is the vine dresser.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.640]   Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.600]   And every branch that bears fruit, he prunes it so that it may bear more fruit.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.560]   You're already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.840]   Abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.840]   vine.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.680]   So neither can you unless you abide in me.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.680]   I am the vine.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.680]   You are the branches.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.400]   He abides in me and I in him.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.480]   He bears much fruit for apart from me, you can do nothing.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.640]   If anyone does not abide in me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up and they gather
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.680]   them and cast them into the fire and they are burned.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.880]   If you abide in me, my words abide in you.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.320]   Ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.560]   My father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.220]   Just as a father has loved me, I have also loved you.
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.720]   Abide in my love.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.080]   If you keep my commandments, you abide in my love.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.020]   Just as I have kept my father's commandment and abide in his love.
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.480]   These things I have spoken to you so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.720]   be made full.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   Let's pray.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.320]   Gracious and loving father, we pray for your anointing over this time.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.020]   We pray father God that your living word that you invested and poured your very breath into
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.800]   that we may be the beneficiary of this, of your word this morning.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.200]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to illumine us, open our eyes Lord God, that we may understand
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.960]   and that our hearts may be moldable as you are the potter and we are the clay and we
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.000]   desire to be molded by your word this morning.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.040]   In Jesus name we pray.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.920]   Amen.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:42.340]   If you had maybe, you know, six hours, you know, or seven hours and you knew that you
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.060]   were going to depart from your loved ones, what are the final words that you would say?
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.660]   What are some instructions that you would give?
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.100]   And if you're parents, like what would you say to your children?
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.400]   Whatever it may be, my guess is you're not going to be frivolous.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.720]   That every word that you say is going to have meaning.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.160]   You're going to think through all the things that you have learned, all the things that
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.580]   you wish that your children would understand.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.600]   And most likely you're going to give them some instructions, whether they understand
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.300]   it or not, you're going to give some instructions to them.
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.500]   My guess is that you're not going to be telling a joke for your last thing that you want to
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.860]   say, right?
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.700]   You know, this week we, our brother Lee, his father passed away last week and had a funeral
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.040]   on Monday.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.500]   And we were, a few of us, the pastors and a few people were able to participate from
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.900]   a distance, obviously because of all that was going on.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.980]   And one of the things that he said was that his father, before he passed away, was in
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.860]   the state of mind where he was able to write a letter to each one of his children and his
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.940]   loved one and just telling them that he loves them and then just giving them fatherly advice,
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.940]   last fatherly advice.
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.100]   And when I heard that, I said, wow, that's really, you know, awesome.
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.420]   And each one of those letters are probably something that each of their children and
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.940]   loved ones are going to cherish for the rest of their lives.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.780]   And I was just kind of curious what he wrote because, you know, whatever he writes there,
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.780]   it's going to be very weighty.
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.740]   It's going to take a lot, he probably took a lot of time thinking about this, you know,
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.820]   80 plus, 87 years or so of his life that he's accumulated through all the sufferings and
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.980]   through the Korean War, immigration and the hardship and, you know, living as a faithful
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.900]   Christian man for so many decades.
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.580]   It's all of that accumulated in that one letter instructing their children that make sure
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.820]   that you understand this.
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:41.100]   Well, the text that we're looking at this morning in a way is Jesus's last teaching
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.740]   that he's leaving to his disciples.
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.180]   You know, what he says here is taking place right after he has the Lord's Supper.
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.180]   And then he's instructed them that one of them are going to betray them.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.500]   And so Judas takes off to go get the temple guards so that they can come in the middle
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.460]   of the night to take him away.
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.020]   And so it was in between that time before they go to the Garden of Gethsemane where
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.940]   he wrestles in prayer and then he gets arrested after that and then he heads to the cross.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.660]   So really this is the last thing that he says to his disciples until after he resurrects
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.340]   and then he commissions them to the Great Commission.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.160]   So you can imagine how important these words are because this was not given to the public.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.660]   This was given specifically to his disciples as instructions that after I leave you make
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.660]   sure that you do this.
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.740]   Now this is the seventh, the last of the I Am statements, the seven I Am statements that
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.180]   we went through.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.060]   And if you look at it superficially you may say, "Wow, you know, there's so many profound
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.380]   and great things that Jesus says in the I Am statements."
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.220]   And I would think that maybe a good way to leave and the last thing that he would say
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.620]   to his disciples is, "I am the resurrection and the life."
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.220]   You know, because he's about to go to the cross, he's about to die and to leave them
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.820]   with that, "I am the resurrection and the life."
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.380]   Or maybe even what he said last week, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.140]   No one goes to the Father but through me."
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.860]   But those were the fifth and sixth and then the seventh, the last one, "I am divine."
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.460]   And this was the last thing that he says to them.
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.540]   This is the last thing that he wanted to make sure he clarifies to his disciples before
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.260]   he goes to the cross.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:27.220]   I mean, it almost sounds mundane superficially if you don't really understand what he is
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.220]   saying.
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.660]   He's not simply saying that, "I am divine.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.660]   You need to be connected to me if you want to bear fruit."
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:39.140]   And again, as important as that is, the reason why he says that is because he's preparing
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.340]   them to leave.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:47.500]   He's preparing to leave them and he wanted them to make sure that they understood.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.740]   My guess is that if you were to write a last letter that you're going to write to your
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:57.060]   children, you're going to have a lot of maybe life wisdom to teach them how to be successful
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.220]   in life.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.380]   Work hard.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.360]   Make sure you're good to people.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.180]   Make sure you're kind.
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.520]   Whatever it is, life instructions, you're probably going to leave behind things that
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.380]   you think are going to help your children to be successful.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:19.020]   Well, chapter 15 is all about bearing fruit.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.460]   He just told them that he's about to leave, but he's also instructing them that after
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.420]   I leave, if you want to continue to bear fruit, this is what you need to do.
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.300]   And so the whole chapter 15 is about Christians bearing fruit.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.940]   After he leaves, he wanted them to continue to do the work that he started, to continue
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.860]   to spread the gospel, build churches.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:46.940]   But he's telling them that you cannot bear this fruit on your own.
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:53.220]   As Christians, and not even just as Christians, in anything that we do, if you start a business
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.940]   and it doesn't do well, you're not bearing fruit.
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.860]   You're not going to do that for too long.
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.100]   If you have a relationship that doesn't bear fruit, meaning that it's not reciprocated,
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.860]   it's just completely one-sided, you're not going to endure it for too long.
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.820]   If you go to school and you put in your time and you go to school and you're staying up
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.820]   at night and trying to do your paper, and at the end of it, you're not making any progress,
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.220]   you're not passing your classes, and it's like, "Maybe this is not for me."
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:25.300]   Whatever it is that you do, whether it's sports, business, relationship, or school, whatever
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:31.980]   you do, if you don't see tangible fruit, eventually you'll lose interest, and you'll probably
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.000]   pack up your bags and try to do something else.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.880]   And it is no different with our faith.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:43.100]   If at some point in our endeavor, memorizing scripture and trying to pray, coming to church,
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:48.780]   if we don't begin to see some progress in the things that we are doing, eventually we
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.940]   lose interest.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:56.780]   We may not physically walk out of the church, but internally, we have no expectations.
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.700]   We just kind of do it, hopefully we can just make it, and we just become very nominal Christians
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.940]   without any goals, without any purpose, and no expectations to ever bear fruit, and we
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.380]   kind of use cliche things like, "God loves us exactly the way we are."
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:16.340]   All of these things may be true, but we kind of revert back to that in order to excuse
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.980]   a life that is fruitless.
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.320]   And so internally, we don't have any excitement.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.660]   Maybe that died way back in college, or maybe when you were younger, maybe before you had
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:32.940]   kids, maybe before you started, had a full-time job, whatever it might be, this vision, this
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.980]   idea that we're going to bear fruit, we're going to expand or get the kingdom of God
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:46.660]   all over the world, for whatever the reason, many Christians fall away from that, and then
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.460]   they just kind of learn to go through the motion.
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:54.220]   I just do my part, and I just make it to next year, and then outside of just going to church
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:11:00.420]   on Sunday and then participating in events, there really isn't this striving after God.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:07.460]   What Jesus is saying here is not a distinguishing mark between a good Christian and a bad Christian.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.800]   That's the first thing that we need to understand.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.060]   He's making a distinguishing mark between a Christian and a non-Christian, because he
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.160]   doesn't say, "If you want to bear fruit, you should do these things, and hopefully you
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.140]   can do a good job and bear more fruit."
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:27.780]   John 15, 2, it says, "Every branch of me that does not bear fruit, he takes away," meaning
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.780]   it gets chopped down.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:34.580]   "And every branch that bears fruit, he prunes it so that it may bear more fruit."
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:39.420]   Again in chapter 15, verse 16, "If anyone does not abide in me, he is thrown away as
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:44.060]   a branch and dries up, and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.060]   burned."
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:52.500]   Again, many people misunderstand this text as in God is giving wise instructions as to
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:57.460]   Christians so that we can bear more fruit, which is also true.
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.500]   But fundamentally what Jesus is telling his disciples, the distinguishing mark between
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.180]   a Christian and a non-Christian is that a Christian bears fruit, and a non-Christian
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.740]   bears no fruit.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.780]   There is no evidence of their faith in their life.
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:20.620]   So what he is saying to his disciples are the identifying mark of a true believer.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:26.620]   So again, it's very, very important that we understand what he is saying.
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:34.020]   But as important as bearing fruit is, as an identifying mark of a Christian, the imperative
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.620]   in this passage is not bear fruit.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:41.700]   Meaning God's ultimate command is not "Go bear fruit."
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:49.500]   Because if you're not a fruit tree, and you're trying to bear fruit, how are you going to
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.540]   feel?
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.540]   What kind of success are you going to have?
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.340]   Zero.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:04.380]   You don't plant a grape vine, or a peach tree, or an apple tree, and then expect pineapples
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.380]   to come out.
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.980]   You're going to be frustrated when only pineapples come out, or maybe no fruits come out.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.900]   The imperative in this passage is not "Go bear fruit."
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.780]   The imperative in this passage is "How do we bear fruit?"
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:23.380]   So that's why he says, "I am the true vine."
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.140]   He's telling them how to bear fruit.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.460]   That after I leave, up to now, you've been just doing whatever I told you to do.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.900]   If I went to Jerusalem, you came with me.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.300]   If I healed the sick, you helped me.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.580]   If I fed the people who were hungry, you carried it and you did my work.
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.820]   But now I'm going to leave."
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:45.060]   And they're all freaking out, like, "Where are you going?"
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.660]   So he's answering that question, "Why can't we go with you?"
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.500]   The disciples are distraught.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.260]   "What's going to happen to us after you leave?
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.960]   How are we going to continue the work?"
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:02.900]   So he's telling them that in order to bear fruit, you must remain in me.
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.860]   That's the "I am" statement that he's making to his disciples, that "I am the vine."
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.340]   If you want to bear fruit, you must abide in me.
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:17.660]   In fact, John himself uses the word "meno," which is translated for "abide" in this passage,
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.340]   50 times in his letters, 50 times.
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:27.260]   So John repeats it in his letters over and over and over again, that if we want to bear
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.500]   fruit, we must abide in Christ.
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:35.540]   That's in this text alone, in chapter 15, he uses the word "meno" to abide 11 separate
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.180]   times.
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.660]   So if you were to read chapter 11 and you have a highlighter, go every time he uses
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:45.100]   the word "abide," highlight it.
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.740]   Because it'll tell you every time you flip that chapter, chapter 15, the highlighter
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.500]   will tell you, "Oh, he's talking about abiding in Christ."
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.340]   It's not necessarily, "Go bear fruit."
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.100]   It's like, "No, you can't bear fruit unless you abide."
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:04.240]   So this word "abide" is a very key word because Jesus is saying that distinguishing mark between
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.380]   a Christian and a non-Christian is abiding.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.160]   For you to be able to bear fruit and continue to do the work that I am sending you to do,
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.700]   you must abide.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:21.420]   In order for you to have any success in your Christian walk with God, you must abide.
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:27.040]   So this word "abide" is a key word in our walk with God.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.420]   Just like the word "love," right?
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.840]   We have "agape" and in the Bible it's very precise.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.480]   So you have family love, you have romantic love, right?
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.400]   You have different familial love, right?
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.660]   But the love that God gives us is the "agape," unconditional love.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.020]   So it's a very precise word.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.900]   So if you've been a Christian for a while, you probably already have heard many times
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:53.220]   the word "agape" because it's crucial.
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.660]   It's foundation to our understanding of our relationship with God.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.100]   He "agape" us.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:06.660]   This word "meno" is just as crucial because we are children of God because He "agape"
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:11.300]   us and then the instruction that He leaves with the disciples, "If you do not meno" with
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.540]   me, you cannot bear fruit.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.620]   You cannot walk with God.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.460]   There is no assurance of salvation.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.860]   So how important is this word "meno"?
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.980]   In fact, just like the word "agape," you know, in English we say "love," whether it's family,
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.840]   chocolate, or you know, God's love, we use the same word.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.740]   So we have to explain the word, right?
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:39.560]   Well this word, again, it's a rich word that really can't be translated with one word.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.140]   So in the NASB, it's translated "abide."
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:49.540]   In some of the other translations, it's translated "to remain."
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:54.500]   Then in other parts of the Bible, in other translations, it'll say "to dwell."
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.820]   In some other translations, it'll say "to continue."
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.980]   You'll see about five or six or even seven different translations of this word, and some
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.460]   of them are very similar and some of them are very different.
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.440]   But the reason why it's so different, and whenever you study the Bible and you look
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.160]   at the different translations and the word that is translated sounds very different,
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.620]   that already indicates to you that that Greek word doesn't have a precise translation in
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:23.700]   the English, and that's why they did their best for whatever context that they used to
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.700]   use that word.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:30.420]   Well, this word "meno" is translated five or six different ways in different translations.
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:36.320]   So it is a very rich word that connects us to God, connects us to Christ, that causes
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.180]   us to bear fruit.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:44.180]   So we're going to be talking about, again, three, you know, just to kind of give you
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.340]   an outline, we're going to give you three insights.
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:51.100]   The most important part of it is the first one, but under each of these, there's going
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.380]   to be sub-points, so just kind of stay with me.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.940]   If you look at the children's outline, it'll show you what the outline is.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:02.820]   The first thing that I want to point out is that Jesus is divine, so we must abide in
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.940]   him, and he says, "I am the true vine," right?
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.980]   The last of the seven "I am" statements.
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:14.460]   But the immediate question that the disciples probably would have asked is, "You just told
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:21.140]   us that you're going to leave, and we cannot follow you."
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.900]   And then when we said, "Well, why can't we follow you?
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.900]   What about us?"
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.060]   And you answer, "You have to abide in me.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.140]   You have to stay with me.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.500]   You have to continue with me.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.980]   You have to dwell with me.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.340]   You have to remain with me."
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.180]   Well, how do we do that if you're going to leave?
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.940]   Why are you teasing us?
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.340]   If you're leaving, we can't abide in you.
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.780]   See, it's that question that he's trying to answer.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:52.420]   What does it mean to abide in Christ in the context of him leaving?
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:56.500]   So again, if you didn't get a lot of sleep last night, and you're kind of coming in and
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.100]   out, and you missed this, I'm telling you right now, you're going to miss the whole
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.100]   sermon.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:05.660]   Not only are you going to miss the whole sermon, I told you this word "meno" is key to your
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.060]   walk with God.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.980]   And so you're not going to understand.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:14.460]   You could possibly, and again, I don't mean to over-exaggerate, but if you don't understand
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:23.020]   this, you can possibly spend all your life trying to bear fruit by your own power and
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:28.740]   be frustrated, which is where many of you might be today.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.660]   I'm trying so hard, but I don't feel like I'm going anywhere.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.660]   Why is this?
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.860]   Well, Jesus is going to answer that.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.020]   What does it mean to abide in Christ to bear fruit?
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:42.580]   If he's the true vine, and I need to connect with him.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:48.860]   Well, if you've ever studied the Gospel of John, you may already know that chapter 14,
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:55.540]   15, and 16 of the Gospel of John has one of the most extensive and the clearest teaching
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.580]   of the role of the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:04.260]   Typically, when we think of the Holy Spirit, we think of him as an "it," like some power
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.420]   source, like the electricity.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.140]   But we already know, if you've been a Christian for a while, that he is the third person of
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.140]   the Trinity.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:17.620]   He is a being, like Christ is a being, like God the Father is a being.
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.460]   But we take a glimpse of, usually the Holy Spirit is kind of mentioned in the background,
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.620]   doing the work, and so we kind of see him as electricity.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:32.260]   But again, the clearest teaching about the personhood of the Holy Spirit that's condensed
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.060]   is in chapter 14, 15, and 16.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:39.980]   The reason why I say this is because Jesus is connecting the dwelling that he is telling
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.220]   them to dwell with him with the fulfillment in the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.020]   Let me say this again.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:52.300]   He is going to leave, but someone else is going to come who's going to dwell in you
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.420]   that you must dwell.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.980]   So you're going to dwell in me by dwelling with him.
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:57.980]   Hopefully you caught that.
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.700]   So if you missed that part, the rest of it is going to be confusing.
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.780]   Not confusing, but it'll be harder than normal.
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.780]   So again, stay with me.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:09.780]   This is what he says.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:14.700]   "I am the true vine," and then in verse 14 he explains, knowing that the disciples may
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.380]   be asking, "How are we going to abide in you?
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.060]   How are we going to stay with you if you're leaving?"
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:24.740]   He says, verse 16, chapter 14 of John, "I will ask the Father, and he will give you
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:30.140]   another helper that he may be with you forever."
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.460]   Now why does he say that?
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.380]   Because he said he's going to leave.
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.820]   If you leave, how are we going to abide?
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.860]   Another one's going to come, but that other one who's going to come isn't going to ever
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.260]   leave you.
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.060]   I have to leave you, but he comes and he's going to stay with you forever.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:51.260]   That is the spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive because this does not see him
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:57.100]   or know him, but you know him because he abides with you and will be in you, and I will not
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.540]   leave you as orphans.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.820]   I will come to you.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.940]   So notice what he says here.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.780]   He says, first of all, he says, "I am leaving.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.540]   You need to abide in me if you want to bear fruit."
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.540]   So, well, how are we going to do that?
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.940]   Well, God's going to send another helper.
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:19.460]   When he comes, he's going to stay with you forever, so even though I may leave, what
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.460]   does he say?
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.140]   "I will be with you."
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:29.980]   In other words, when he says to abide in him, he's introducing the Holy Spirit that they
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:35.980]   may abide with him, and by abiding with him, you will be abiding with me.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.120]   Did you catch that?
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:42.620]   So he's using the presence of the Holy Spirit and his presence interchangeably.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:48.300]   Okay, so this is a very important text about the Holy Spirit, so let me highlight three
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.820]   things that he says about the Holy Spirit here.
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:57.420]   First of all, the word that he uses when he says, "He will give you another helper."
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:04.300]   In the Greek, there are two words that can be translated "another."
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:10.700]   First word is the word "alos," which is the word that is used here, and it means "another"
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.700]   of the same kind.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:16.620]   Let's say, as an example, if a police officer is on the scene, and that police officer has
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.020]   to go, and he says, "Well, I need to go, but another police officer is going to come, and
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.220]   he's going to continue to help you."
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.140]   That's the word "alos."
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:33.940]   There's another word of another kind, in quality, and that's "heteros."
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:39.100]   Both words can be translated "another," but the word that he uses here is "alos."
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:44.980]   So if the other one that is coming is different than him, then he would have used the word
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.980]   "heteros."
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:53.420]   But by using the word "alos," he's saying, as he is equal to the Father, another equal
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:24:00.380]   to me, who is just like me, is coming to continue the work that I started with you.
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:06.300]   So in other words, Jesus was equating the Holy Spirit with him, and he equated himself
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:13.140]   with the Father, so he is saying, in a sense, "I am not leaving you."
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:17.820]   Just as the Father didn't abandon you and sent me, I am not abandoning you, and I will
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.020]   send the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:25.100]   His role, the Holy Spirit's role, is not different from Jesus.
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.980]   In other words, I am not abandoning you.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:35.620]   In John 16, 7, "But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away."
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.420]   Think about that if you're disciples and you're hearing him.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.420]   This is the Messiah.
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:43.180]   This is the guy who raises people from the dead.
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:49.500]   This is the guy who walks on waters and then calms the storms, just by his word.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:55.020]   And he says, "I am going, you cannot follow me, but in fact, it's better for you if I
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.920]   go, because until I go, he will not come."
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:04.740]   So in other words, what he's saying is, the coming of the Holy Spirit is actually more
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:10.180]   beneficial for you than if I have stayed.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:16.580]   How often have you thought, "Man, it would have been awesome, you know, it would have
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:21.180]   been awesome to be on earth when Jesus was walking this earth, right?
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.780]   It would have been great to be in Jerusalem when he was at the temple, if I was there
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.780]   and I ate the miraculous bread and the fish, right?"
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:34.260]   I mean, we probably all have thought that, and that's why so many people will pay lots
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:38.900]   of money to go to Jerusalem and walk on the streets that he walked on and look at the
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.700]   trees and the scenery that he enjoyed.
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:47.260]   But Jesus says, "It's better for you," meaning better for all of us that he left.
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:53.060]   Our current situation is better than the situation that the disciples were in when Jesus was
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.620]   saying this to them.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.540]   That's a pretty radical statement.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:03.020]   In other words, the Holy Spirit that's going to come is going to do mightier things in
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:07.860]   us than if when Jesus was here in person.
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.500]   That's pretty radical.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.820]   Well what is, when he comes, what does he do?
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.620]   What is his primary work?
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.460]   John, right?
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:22.900]   In John chapter 114, he says, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us," right?
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.900]   Talking about Jesus.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:29.620]   Well, the Word dwelt here, and again, like I said, if you are tired, you may have already
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.560]   gone over your head, right?
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.340]   But I'm trying to give you the ministry of the Holy Spirit and the transition that Jesus
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.820]   is making to the disciples and how important this is, right?
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.060]   Because this is the center of what Jesus came to do.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.500]   He said, "Christ came and he dwelt among us."
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:48.060]   The word dwelt here is not meno.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:52.100]   Even the word meno has the idea of dwelling, right?
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:57.700]   But the word dwelt here is the word literally to pitch a tent.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:05.580]   So when Christ came, he came into our campground, he took on our flesh, and he lived among us,
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.840]   right?
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.040]   He lived among us.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:15.460]   But of the Holy Spirit, he says in John chapter 14, 17, "This is the Spirit of truth whom
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:20.660]   the world cannot receive because it does not see him or know him, but you know him because
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:26.100]   he abides with you and will be in you."
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:32.180]   The distinction between Jesus' dwelling and the dwelling of the Holy Spirit is Jesus came
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:33.820]   and he pitched a tent among us.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:38.960]   In other words, he came and was in the campground with us.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.700]   He walked with us, he lived with us, he ate with us.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:48.500]   But the Holy Spirit, he's going to come and he's going to indwell in us.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.480]   He didn't just pitch a tent.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.660]   Our union with the Holy Spirit is that he indwells in us.
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.020]   Do you understand the distinction?
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:02.940]   And that's why Jesus was saying, "It is better for you that I leave because I'm only here
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:08.460]   to pitch a tent with you, but I'm going so that the Holy Spirit can come and actually
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:14.260]   pitch a tent in you, that the Holy Spirit is in you."
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.900]   So let me wrap this up, what Jesus is saying.
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:24.920]   What Jesus is saying is he came and he dwelt among us, among us, so that he can prepare
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.860]   us so that the Holy Spirit can dwell in us.
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.100]   Do you get that?
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:39.660]   In Mark chapter 2, 21, Jesus tells the disciples, right?
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:46.080]   He tells the tax collectors and he's telling the story about, you know, about the Holy
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:53.060]   Spirit and he says, "No one puts new wine into old wineskin."
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.100]   If you put new wine into old wineskin, what happens to the old wineskin?
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.880]   It bursts, right?
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:04.480]   So in order for you to put the new wine into the bag, you need to make sure that you need
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.320]   to have a new bag.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.580]   So you put the new wine into the new wineskin.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.580]   What is he talking about?
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.660]   Is he talking about getting drunk?
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:22.260]   Right, he's like, "Next time we have a wedding, make sure that the wineskin is new."
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.220]   What is he saying?
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:31.780]   I believe what Jesus was saying in that text is related to what he's saying here.
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:36.580]   His whole purpose of why he went to the cross and he said, remember he said, "I'm going
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.540]   to the Father's house and prepare a house for you."
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.580]   It is not that the heaven is not ready.
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.220]   He's preparing us to be in heaven.
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.820]   Well how is he going to do that?
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.740]   He made us into new wineskin.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.440]   Do you understand that?
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:30:00.280]   By washing us with his blood, by forgiving us our sins, atoning for our sins, he made
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.220]   the old wineskin into new wineskin.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:07.060]   He said, "Whoever is in Christ," what does he say?
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.860]   "The old has passed, behold the new has come."
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.380]   Talking about us.
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.540]   Now why did we have to be made new?
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.700]   So that the new wine can come in.
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.580]   And what is the new wine he's referring to?
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.720]   The Holy Spirit.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.100]   And that's exactly what happens after the resurrection in Acts chapter 2.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:32.240]   The Holy Spirit comes and he's not, he doesn't pitch a tent among us, he makes it indwelling
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.420]   in us.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.180]   And so now the Holy Spirit is in us.
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:43.300]   And that's why he says because he's indwelling in us, if you want to bear fruit, you're not
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.620]   going to be the one bearing the fruit.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.200]   The Holy Spirit is going to be bearing fruit through you.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:58.060]   So because Jesus is divine, and the Holy Spirit is coming, you must, as he dwells in you,
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.540]   you must also dwell in him.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:08.580]   So the key to our walk with God, key to bearing fruit, is walking in the Spirit, praying in
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:14.380]   the Spirit, fellowshipping in the Spirit, studying in the Spirit.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:19.240]   That our whole life is connected with the Spirit because we cannot by our own strength.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.420]   That's what he means.
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.920]   So that was probably the most difficult.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.060]   If you didn't catch all of that, I strongly encourage you to go back and listen to that
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.900]   again.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:34.780]   Maybe I didn't do a good job connecting this, but this is key to our walk with God.
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:39.940]   Because he says if you do not meno with him, you cannot bear fruit.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:45.020]   And if you do not bear fruit, if there's no evidence of any fruit, that means there is
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.220]   no connection with him.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.540]   And if you don't have any connection with him, what does he say?
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.260]   It gets chopped down to be burned.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.780]   In other words, you are probably not a Christian.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:32:02.660]   So the key to our walk with God, key to our identity in God, is the Holy Spirit in us.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:09.060]   Second thing that he says, he says the helper is going to come, but he says he will not
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.620]   leave you as orphans.
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.660]   Now the word orphan itself, right?
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:20.420]   Do we call somebody who's 30 years old and his mother and father passed away early, do
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.740]   we call them orphans?
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.620]   Normally we don't.
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.700]   If they're grown up adults, they say you were orphaned when you were young.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:34.580]   But we don't typically call somebody in their 30s, 40s, and 50s, you know, and I'm 52 years
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.860]   old and say, you know, I'm orphaned because my parents died.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.980]   We don't usually use that for older people.
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:45.180]   Usually when we say somebody's orphaned, it means that when they were young children,
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.180]   they were helpless.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:50.340]   They needed parents to guide them, shelter them, and take care of them, and the parents,
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:54.440]   for whatever reason, wasn't there, right?
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:33:00.420]   So when he says, I will not leave you as orphans, by him saying that, he's telling them that
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:05.520]   you are helpless, and I'm not going to leave you that way.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:12.020]   So the Holy Spirit is coming, not to simply assist you, it's so that he may not leave
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.260]   you as orphans, as helpless.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:22.100]   In fact, the word for the Holy Spirit here, paracletus, in our translation, it's translated
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.100]   helper.
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.340]   Again, this is another word that can't be translated with one single word.
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:33.140]   So if you look at your different translations, it'll say helper, counselor, advocate, or
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.060]   comforter.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:40.060]   The word literally means the one who's called to one side.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:46.020]   In other words, if you're headed toward a path, somebody is given to you to stay with
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.020]   you the whole way.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:51.900]   And that's how the Holy Spirit is described for us in the Bible, that he is a helper,
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:57.700]   a counselor, an advocate, a comforter, whatever it is that you need for you to continue this
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.420]   journey.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.980]   The Holy Spirit is going to come, he's going to guide us and lead us.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.380]   Well, what does he guide us and lead us to?
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:11.100]   John chapter 14, verse 26, "But the helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:16.660]   in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I said
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:17.660]   to you."
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:23.500]   Now, I want you to really hone in on what he says here, because when we think of the
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:29.460]   Holy Spirit, a lot of people think of the Holy Spirit as some supernatural power or
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:34.220]   some feeling that we get when we are in the middle of worship or we're praying and there's
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:39.660]   some outside force that keeps coming in, touching us, and then leaving us when we're done.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.700]   That's not how the Bible describes the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:47.660]   He said that the Holy Spirit, the helper, the counselor, the advocate, the comforter,
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.820]   he's going to stay with you, right, the whole time.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.140]   He doesn't come and go.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:56.780]   There is no two baptism of the Holy Spirit, there are no three baptism.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:02.580]   There is no Christian who doesn't have the Holy Spirit in them constantly, right?
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:06.100]   He said he's going to come, he's going to stay with you, and the primary thing that
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:11.780]   he's come to do is to remind you of the things that I have already said to you.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:18.540]   In other words, he's going to take the Word of God and he's going to make it effective
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.860]   in our lives.
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:25.180]   And you know that there's a huge difference between just studying the Bible and being
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:29.680]   illuminated by the Bible, where the Word of God is being used to judge the thoughts and
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.820]   intentions of other people's hearts, versus the Word of God being judging the thoughts
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.100]   and intentions of your heart.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:41.420]   While you can hear the same gospel for years and years and years, and for whatever the
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:47.380]   reason, the Holy Spirit opens your eyes and the same Word makes complete sense.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.060]   And you repent and you give your life to follow Christ.
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:54.300]   That's the difference between studying the Word of God and having the Word of God illuminate
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.760]   you by the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.020]   And he says the Holy Spirit is going to come and do that.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.620]   He says he's going to cause you to remember, to think about all the Word, the gospel that
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:07.940]   has been preached, and make it effective for you.
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.380]   John chapter 16, verse 13, "But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:17.260]   into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own initiative, but whatever he hears,
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:21.460]   he will speak and he will disclose to you what is to come."
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:26.820]   So the role of the Holy Spirit, just like Jesus, he says, "I do not speak on my own
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.380]   initiative, I say whatever the Father told me."
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.820]   And then the Holy Spirit says the same thing.
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:39.820]   The Holy Spirit comes to remind us and to make the Word of Christ effective in us.
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:46.540]   And so the primary way that the Holy Spirit comes alongside is through his Word.
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.020]   Through his Word.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:55.520]   So without a clear hearing of his voice, you cannot be abiding in Christ.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.020]   You cannot be abiding by the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.500]   Let me say that again.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:04.860]   Without a clear hearing of the voice of Christ, the work of the Holy Spirit automatically
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.120]   gets quenched.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:11.060]   Because that was the primary reason why the Holy Spirit was to come.
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:17.660]   To come alongside, to help, to counsel, to advocate, and to comfort us through his Word.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:24.660]   Romans chapter 8, verse 26, he says, "In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses."
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.580]   He helps our weaknesses in our comfort.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:32.200]   He reminds us of the truth that we already know.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:36.280]   I think many of you have gone through a lot of trials, even just the last couple of months.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:42.140]   Whether it's through a job or sickness or a loved one who you may have lost.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:45.500]   Some difficult things that are happening in your life.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.620]   And how did the Holy Spirit come and comfort you?
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.140]   Reminded you of the truth that you already know.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.440]   That our God is sovereign.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.940]   That we're only here temporarily.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.140]   That God hears our prayers.
[00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.440]   That he walks among us.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.120]   And so the Holy Spirit comes and he comforts us in our weakness.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.700]   For we do not know how to pray as we should.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:15.580]   You know what's really interesting to me is, Paul, through the Holy Spirit, tells us, "You're
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:19.860]   not going to be good at praying."
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:25.080]   In some sense, it's weirdly encouraging.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.380]   Because most Christians will say their weakest part of their walk with God is prayer.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.220]   Now, this is not an excuse that we shouldn't pray.
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.220]   We are challenged.
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.600]   We are told to be devoted to prayer.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:41.500]   But Paul himself says, "God knows that you're going to be struggling in prayer.
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:46.160]   That you're going to have a hard time knowing even what to pray for."
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.760]   But the Spirit himself intercedes.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:52.720]   In other words, him knowing our weakness has given us the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:57.440]   Because what you are not effective in doing, God will do through the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:04.320]   Holy Spirit intercedes for us, not just with any prayer, but with groanings too deep for
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.720]   words.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:10.280]   I think if you've lived long enough as a Christian, you've probably groaned in your prayers before
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.760]   yourself.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:16.080]   You don't have words to express, but it expresses your emotions and your thoughts.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.880]   And you can't articulate with words, but it's like, "Oh my God.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.040]   My God, my God."
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.600]   He says that the prayers of the Holy Spirit are deep.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.600]   It is weighty.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:30.840]   Because it is groaning on behalf of our weakness.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.680]   He said, "We're not going to succeed.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.960]   We're not going to bear fruit because we're trying harder.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.720]   We're more disciplined, or we're better.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.720]   We're more moral.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.320]   Or we're better educated.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.520]   Or we had the proper training."
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:52.160]   He said, "No, you're going to bear fruit because the Holy Spirit has been deposited in you
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:58.720]   so that you may bear fruit as He dwells in you, that you continue to dwell with Him."
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:03.400]   And thirdly, he says, this Holy Spirit, not only does He come to help, not only does He
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:09.040]   not leave us as orphans, and helps us in our weakness, He says, "This is forever."
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:14.200]   Jesus came physically for a period of time, for 33 years, for three years in ministry.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.080]   And then He did many miracles, but then He had to physically go.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:24.040]   So physically, He's up in heaven, sitting at the right hand of the Father.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:30.440]   But He said, "When the Holy Spirit comes, this helper," He says, "is going to be forever."
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:34.640]   Ephesians 1, 13 to 14, "In Him you also, after listening to the message of the truth, the
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.960]   gospel of your salvation, having also believed, you were sealed."
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.160]   You are, in other words, you are marked to be genuine believers in Him with the Holy
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.160]   Spirit of promise.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.000]   In other words, the distinguishing mark between a Christian and non-Christian is the Holy
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.480]   Spirit.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.120]   Has the Holy Spirit opened your eyes?
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.800]   Is there an indwelling of the Holy Spirit?
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:58.440]   Is there evidence of the fruit of the Spirit in your life?
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.840]   Who is given as a pledge?
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.560]   Some of your translations, the word pledge is deposit, right?
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.640]   And I don't know if people still do that today.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:11.680]   If you go into a store and you see, I don't know, you see a iPhone, I don't know what
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.880]   you would buy at a store, you know, or pants, you know what I mean?
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.880]   I don't know.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.240]   A long time ago when I would go to a store and I couldn't afford the pants, I would put
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:25.840]   $5 deposit because I don't want that pants being sold because as you can see, I don't
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.140]   have a normal body.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.000]   So it's very difficult to find pants that fit.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.400]   So if I find one, I need to make sure that I put a deposit, that nobody else, like me,
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.320]   which probably doesn't exist, but that they're going to, if he does come, they're going to
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.320]   want that pants.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:45.240]   So I would put the deposit down and then even if I come put $5 every week, at some point
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.080]   I'm going to pick up the pants, right?
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.200]   That's how they used to do it, right?
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.840]   I don't know if they'd still do that today, right?
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.400]   No, it doesn't exist.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.400]   Okay.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.220]   It's only for the people that are older, okay?
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.680]   But that's what deposit means.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:03.680]   Deposit is guaranteeing that the person who put the deposit, that from that moment on,
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.320]   even though it is not complete, they didn't pick it up yet, that they have every intention
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:12.880]   to pick it up and when the time comes, they're going to come and pick it up and no one else
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.720]   can claim that for themselves.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:22.240]   Well, the Bible says that the Holy Spirit has been given to us as a pledge, as a deposit.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.520]   For what purpose?
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.760]   As an assurance of our redemption.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.880]   He didn't just leave it up to us.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.880]   You figure it out.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.960]   You know, I've given you all the things that you need.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.960]   I gave you the church.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:41.600]   I gave you leaders, you know, and I gave you spiritual gifts and I'm going to leave you
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:48.200]   and I'm going to wait on the other side, hope you make it.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:53.360]   That's not what he did because he knew we couldn't make it.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.480]   He knew that we were going to have a hard time even praying.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:04.960]   So the Holy Spirit is deposited in us as a pledge, guaranteeing that what he started,
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.440]   he will complete.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:12.720]   That's why he said, Paul says, he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.480]   He doesn't say, he who started a good work in you, hopefully you can finish the job.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.120]   Doesn't say that.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:24.360]   What he started, he will continue to bring to completion.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.600]   Now, how does he do that?
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.120]   He said, by the Holy Spirit deposited in us.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:35.240]   So when he says, I am the vine, he says, as the Holy Spirit dwells in you, you must also
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.840]   dwell in him.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.320]   And this is forever.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.160]   This is not just until we get to heaven.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.800]   Because if it just goes, if the dwelling of the Holy Spirit is just to get to heaven,
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.440]   it wouldn't be forever.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.580]   Right?
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.280]   It would be until I come.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:55.360]   No, but he says, no, Holy Spirit will be indwelling forever.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:02.880]   Our union with Christ and his death and resurrection isn't just so that we can cross the bridge.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.720]   And that's why he doesn't say that Christianity isn't simply about erasing the consequence
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.800]   of sin.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.760]   The Bible describes us as new creatures.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.240]   The old is gone.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:20.200]   Whatever we were before, the Holy Spirit made an indwelling in us, is gone.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.320]   We may have bad habits.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:27.320]   Because we still live in this flesh, we may have things that we remember of the past,
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.640]   a lot of habits that we still have.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:34.740]   But at the core of who we are, the Holy Spirit completely changed us.
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.760]   We have been made into new wineskin.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:42.960]   That's why people often ask, Adam and Eve fell at the Garden of Eden.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:49.640]   And oftentimes the heaven is described as a new heaven, new Garden of Eden.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:54.520]   Well Adam and Eve fell at the Garden of Eden, so what guarantees us that when we get to
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:59.440]   heaven that this is going to happen again and this whole cycle is going to begin again?
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.160]   The answer is simple.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.440]   The Holy Spirit is indwelling in us.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:12.480]   So the state that we will be in eternity will be much better than Adam and Eve was from
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.480]   the beginning.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:21.560]   So the recreation of what was lost at the fall is not only going to be recreated to
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:25.560]   what it was, but it's going to be far above that.
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.160]   That we have become co-heirs with Christ.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.480]   And that's what the Holy Spirit is.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.280]   The Holy Spirit has made an indwelling in us.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:37.720]   And so therefore we are called to continue with Him.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.880]   Does that make sense?
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.720]   I mean this is heavy.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.760]   I mean it's really heavy.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:48.560]   So if any of you fell asleep for five minutes even at home, I know your couch is really
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.040]   comfortable.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.560]   All the messages, all the I Am statements are crucial.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:59.800]   But I encourage you if any part of this went over your head, go back and listen to it again.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:05.000]   And then if my English isn't good enough, then go to the commentaries and read it for
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   yourselves.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.480]   This is that important.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:13.560]   Jesus leaving, Holy Spirit coming, indwelling, that He is going to help us, He's going to
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.080]   stay with us, He's not going to leave us as orphans.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:20.000]   And this is going to be eternal.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.160]   Is at the core of who we are.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:27.400]   And He says until you do that, until you understand that, you cannot bear fruit.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:36.280]   Until the fig tree who has dried up and cursed, God completely transforms us into a peach
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:42.120]   tree, you will not bear peach fruit.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:47.280]   So let me stop a minute right here.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:53.880]   There's a lot of people who are in the church who came in and never really met Christ.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.320]   Never really met Christ.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:47:01.640]   So you've heard the talk of the Holy Spirit, you've done Bible study, maybe you might even
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:05.320]   be leading things.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:10.960]   But the only experience that you have in your walk with God is frustration.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:15.040]   Because you have all these standards that have been set for you that Jesus is holy,
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:20.320]   so we ought to be holy, God is holy, the temple is holy, we ought to strive for holiness,
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.800]   we need to love unconditionally.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:27.040]   And so the more we hear the imperatives of what it means to be a Christian, it doesn't
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.360]   free you.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.920]   It doesn't cause joy in your life.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.760]   Because Christianity just sounds like a lot of rules.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:43.560]   What you do enjoy is friendship, purpose, community, that when we die I don't have to
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.880]   be afraid of death.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.320]   So those things are very beneficial.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:57.160]   But the actual walk with God is tremendously burdensome.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:03.200]   Because you may be a fig tree trying to bear peaches.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.280]   So you naturally gravitate toward the world.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.080]   But then you live physically in the church.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.360]   And so you're constantly torn.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:19.700]   So you understand it mentally, you understand it logically, and you can regurgitate information
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:23.360]   that you have heard, especially if you've been at a church for a long time, you know
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:27.600]   all the systematic theology, but you never understood when Jesus said, "I have come to
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.520]   give life and give this life abundantly."
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.400]   What does that mean?
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.780]   What does that mean?
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.960]   My sheep will hear my voice and they will follow me.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:45.880]   See the danger of living in a post-Christian culture is that a lot of non-Christians who
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:54.280]   have many Christian friends are peer pressured to act like Christians when they've never
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.000]   met the Lord.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:06.320]   Jesus says you cannot bear fruit unless you abide in him, remain with him, dwell with
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:09.480]   him, continue with him.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:12.480]   Do you know this Lord?
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:17.320]   I'm not talking about some charismatic experience where you have some overwhelming experience
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:24.520]   or emotions that overwhelm, you can't help but uncontrollably cry.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:32.200]   But do you understand what it means to have life, to have this life abundantly?
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.760]   You know, I'm not going to be able to finish this sermon this morning because I don't want
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:41.160]   to go longer than I should, especially online.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:46.940]   But when we abide in Christ, he says, again for the last part, I'm going to revisit the
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.840]   second part and we're going to skip to the last part.
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:54.320]   When we abide in Christ and we bear fruit, he says four things happen in verse 8.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.640]   It glorifies God.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:01.000]   This is the way we give glory to God.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.920]   It's not coming to church and raising your hands and just doing the right things.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:14.400]   He says, no, when we abide in Christ and that causes us to bear much fruit, he said fruit
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.120]   is what brings glory to God.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:23.560]   A Christian who is constantly living in this cycle of sin and never really understanding
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:32.520]   what it means to bear fruit and never really reproducing and therefore God is not glorified.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:39.080]   No matter how much we try to glorify God, it's kind of like pushing a dead car that
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.360]   doesn't have gasoline.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:47.480]   You know, it's just dead weight that you have to push, but you're not going anywhere.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.280]   Until we abide in Christ, you cannot bear fruit.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.560]   And when we bear fruit, it brings glory to God.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:58.800]   Verse 8, it says, and it proves that we are his disciples.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:05.080]   Proofs of salvation isn't simply somebody telling you, don't doubt, don't doubt.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:10.840]   We live in a generation where, you know, doubting for any reason is unhealthy.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:11.840]   It's not good.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:12.840]   Don't ever doubt.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.840]   Don't ever question your faith.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.160]   When the Bible is filled with examine yourself.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.680]   Is your faith genuine?
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:25.520]   What you see in scripture of what a genuine believer looks like and what he bears fruit,
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.540]   does that look like you?
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:28.540]   Is that you?
[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:34.280]   You're not talking about some external standard of like, am I doing this and am I doing that?
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.980]   Just at the core of it, do you know this Christ?
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.880]   Have you met this Christ?
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.640]   Have you truly seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ?
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:48.240]   In the end, he says, when God is glorified, and because we bear fruit and we abide in
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:53.520]   Christ, it will give us assurance of who we are, that we're his disciples.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.720]   And then verse 9 and 10, it says, then we abide in his love.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:00.800]   In his love, that we have assurance of this love.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.600]   It's confirmed.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.800]   That is not just wishful thinking.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.400]   It's not just some empty words that are given to people because they're having a hard time
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.040]   in life.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.080]   God loves you unconditionally.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:18.400]   And the love of God is spread so generously to everybody without context.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:22.040]   And so you have Christians and non-Christians who are absolutely assured.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.160]   Well, God loves me unconditionally.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:29.880]   So God is not calling me to repent of sins because he loves me unconditionally.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:35.760]   He says, no, when we are bearing fruit, when we are abiding in Christ, when God is glorified
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:43.160]   and that we are his disciples, that that is confirmed, then he says his love is assured.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.080]   Then we abide in his love and his love abides in us.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:52.120]   And then in verse 11, he says, finally, the reason why he says all of this is not to bring
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:55.600]   a burden upon the church.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:01.360]   He says so that my joy may be in you and that the joy may be full in you is ultimately bring
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:04.320]   joy.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:12.360]   So for a true believer who has met Christ, righteousness is a joy.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:15.240]   Holiness produces joy.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:20.240]   Pursuit of Christ we pursue not simply because it's our duty, but that's where we find life.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:26.240]   Abiding in Christ is where we drink the living water.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:33.240]   Abiding in Christ is where we eat the bread that we do not thirst and we are no longer hungry.
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:44.240]   And so the challenge for us as we look at this, and again, as I said, what Jesus says
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:47.240]   here is the key to Christian life.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:51.240]   Am I genuinely abiding in Christ?
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.240]   Is God glorified?
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.240]   Do I have assurance?
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:57.240]   Do I have confidence in his love?
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:02.240]   And am I living this abundant life that he promised?
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.240]   Or do I find life somewhere else?
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:09.240]   And then when I come to church, I find duty.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:13.240]   My prayer is, again, as you know, we don't know exactly when the church is going to open up.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:18.240]   You know, it may be a few weeks, maybe, hopefully it won't be more than that.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:24.240]   But this divine appointed time that God has given us to be home and take some time to reflect,
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:31.240]   and that when we come back together physically as a church, that we do not just come back
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.240]   and just go through the motions.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.240]   That we don't just do what we normally did in the past and we're going to worship again
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.240]   because that's what we did before.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:42.240]   We're going to be joining small groups and studying inductive bibles because that's what
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.240]   we did before.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:50.240]   That we would examine ourselves so that when we come to church, that we would truly build a church
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:54.240]   that will worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:55:01.240]   That the fruit that we bear is not just harder work, you know, just simply because we just figured
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:07.240]   out how to do this better, but because we are genuinely abiding in Christ.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:10.240]   So let me pray for us.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:18.240]   And again, just to kind of remind you, there's going to be a sign up after maybe within an hour or so.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:23.240]   So please go there as soon as you can so that we can know which services are full and we can
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.240]   kind of direct that hopefully by the end of this week.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.240]   Okay, let me pray for us.
