[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.520]   We're going to jump into our study now and I'd like to kind of introduce the thought
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.920]   in terms of for the passage today with a question of have you ever hit your limit?
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.720]   Okay, think about that.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.360]   Now I don't mean like have you ever hit your limit at the buffet, you know, when you eat
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.040]   till the food's up here.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.520]   I'm talking about have you ever hit your limit where you really just wanted to give up, whether
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.300]   it's at work.
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.900]   You kind of hit that do not exceed line in terms of your stress level and your patience
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.120]   was just given out and even physically you're just burnt.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.160]   You feel like you're gassed out and all these many terms that we have, you know, your fuse
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.080]   is all gone and whatever it may be, have you ever come to that point?
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.080]   I'm sure many of us have, you know, because we have lots of demands on our lives.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.160]   What's really interesting though about the passage today as we transition from the previous
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.680]   passage is that regularly as we walk with God, especially even in moments when we hit
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.120]   our limit, he tends to call us to do more, right?
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.560]   I mean if you think about it, God is a God who is infinitely greater.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.680]   God is a God who is unique in the sense that he is supreme, cream of the crop, far above
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.080]   everything, you know, how high he goes, we just can't ever fathom.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.640]   And as we continue to live with him, we just keep seeing whatever we thought was an acceptable
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.920]   standard, he keeps showing us more.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.840]   He reveals to us a greater level of patience, a greater level of what it means to be long
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.160]   suffering, right?
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.040]   An incredibly far surpassing measure of love.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.480]   And every aspect of what you and I think perhaps, like man, that's my limit, God tends to keep
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.800]   showing us more.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.160]   But what's interesting is he also tends to expect more of us as well.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.480]   As he calls us his own, we are going to regularly experience a challenging of the preconceived
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.800]   expectations and standards that we have for our lives.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.600]   And sometimes, some of these expectations are going to feel really surprising, like
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.880]   you want me to do what?
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.840]   You know?
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.320]   Because for us, sometimes it might not seem possible, it might not even seem good in our
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.860]   estimation, right?
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.760]   But as we walk with the Lord, because God is holy and because God is far above us, he's
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.920]   going to regularly challenge the value system that we practice in our lives.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.480]   I don't know how you felt, but once you start making a list, you know when the Bible does
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.760]   one of these rapid fire commands, like do you got to do this, this, this, this, this,
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.120]   this, this, and then you take into context where these people were, it's kind of surprising.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.800]   To people who maybe, you know, last time I said these people were in need of encouragement,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.000]   these people were in need of strength and comforting, which Apostle Peter gave.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.080]   But with that hand in hand, he gave to people who were under persecution that we can't even
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.240]   fathom, right?
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.040]   He gave these people also the expectations of God.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.120]   And what I remember is Jesus teaching in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 12, Jesus is the one,
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.640]   if you recall, he's the one who said, "To whom much is given, from him much will be
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   required."
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.440]   Right?
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.200]   And so what we have is a transition.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.800]   Today is a transition day where there is a big therefore, and you always have to pay
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.000]   attention to those.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.400]   Eh?
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.120]   Echo, echo.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.240]   So what's going on here is, remember in the previous times, Apostle Peter went at length
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.560]   to describe, this is what you have.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.680]   You have an election.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.440]   You have an inheritance.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.840]   It's imperishable, undefiled, unfading, reserved for you.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.080]   You have the Spirit, the power of God, and he continues to go on.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.600]   And then now, here it comes.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.480]   Therefore, here is the high calling of God for people who have truly experienced this.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.240]   If you've really gone through the experience of receiving such great grace from God, this
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.580]   is the high calling God has for us.
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.640]   So I entitled this study, "The High Calling of Our Lord."
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.880]   Let's jump right in here to the first, or actually, I want to do a quick overview, okay?
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.360]   So we're going to read the passage and then do a quick overview.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.680]   As I was studying it more, like first reading, I made an entire outline, which I'm going
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.960]   to share with you, my initial outline.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.240]   And then I realized, you know what, this section goes a bit longer.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.800]   It actually goes up until chapter 2, verse 3.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.120]   However, if I were to cover all that, it'd be like way too long.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.320]   And just as a preface, there's no way we're going to do an in-depth study of like 10 verses
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.760]   every hour on Friday, or Wednesday, right?
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.520]   So we're going to be covering certain sections and highlighting certain things.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.600]   But let's take a look at the passage together right now.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:25.500]   It says in verse 13, and I'm reading out of the ESV today, "Therefore, preparing your
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.760]   minds for action and being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.040]   brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.660]   As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance.
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:45.940]   But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written,
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.400]   you shall be holy for I am holy.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.040]   And if you call on him as father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds,
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.520]   conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile, knowing that you were
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.120]   ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.640]   Not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ,
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.360]   like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.840]   He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was made manifest in the last
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.440]   times for the sake of you.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.760]   Who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.040]   so that your faith and hope are in God.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.960]   Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love,
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.460]   love one another earnestly from a pure heart.
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.560]   Since you have been born again, not to perishable seed, but of imperishable, to the living and
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.760]   abiding word of God, for all flesh is like grass and all is glory like the flowers of
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.920]   grass.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.260]   The grass withers and the flower falls, but the word of the Lord remains forever.
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.920]   And this word is the good news that was preached to you.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.380]   So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:05.520]   Like newborn infants long for the pure spiritual milk that by it you may grow up into salvation.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.120]   If indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.520]   All right.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.360]   So the section goes a little bit longer, but today we're going to be focusing on verses
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.440]   13 through 21 and taking a look at some of the commandments and motivations that we have
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.640]   there.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:28.960]   So as a way of outlining, please just go ahead and yell out what's the first main and I'm
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.920]   looking for main.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.800]   I asked for not dependent clauses, but standalone independent clauses.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   Okay.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.820]   That has a subject predicate kind of thing.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.420]   So let's identify the three that are in these verses, verse 13 through 21.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.420]   Okay.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:52.020]   What's the first one that you guys saw?
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.900]   Yes.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.420]   Set your hope fully.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.420]   Okay.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.060]   Fully on the grace to come.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:10.780]   What's the second one?
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.780]   Excellent.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:17.260]   So that one we can piece together because there is a negative command is don't do this.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.260]   Okay.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.820]   But that goes hand in hand, almost like the corollary to the second part of that, which
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.020]   is be holy.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.220]   So that actually just pieces right together.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:33.420]   Second one, you can summarize as be holy as God is holy.
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.780]   And then the third one.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.460]   Excellent.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.020]   Conduct yourselves in fear.
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.020]   Okay.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.380]   Conduct yourselves in fear.
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:52.260]   So we see these three commandments and the way that I would like, I asked you guys to
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.140]   outline a lot of times, that's the way I would outline a passage.
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:01.740]   When I see that, Oh, we're getting into a section that is didactic, meaning it's teaching
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.060]   you with commands.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.100]   Then I'll look at the commands and I'll say, okay, what are the main verbs here?
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.100]   There are other verbs.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.100]   Okay.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.780]   There are other commands, like command sounding things, but what are the core ones?
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:18.060]   And I'll set those three as the primary points of an outline.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:24.660]   And then I'll notice underneath that on a tier underneath, I'll start to write down
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.020]   the other phrases that go in.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.380]   Does that describe a means by which how I obey that?
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.020]   A source by which I obey that?
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.460]   A motivation by which I obey that?
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.340]   And so that's the way that I would outline something.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.340]   Okay.
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.940]   I know it'd be helpful if I had like a PowerPoint and stuff, but as you saw last time, I can't
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.940]   do multitask.
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.940]   So we're just going to go with, go with the handout.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.940]   Okay.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.940]   All right.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.380]   So anyway, I just wanted to share with you that because again, I just want to share as
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.380]   I go on, just little like tips on how I outline certain passages.
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.700]   And again, that's how I typically am able to better retain that content.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:06.400]   So I know this section, verse 13 through 21 has three main commands for me.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:12.140]   These commands that I summarize as God's high calling, which is set your hope fully on the
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:17.420]   future grace, be holy as God is holy and conduct yourselves in fear.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.420]   Right?
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:23.700]   And as I kind of repeated that to myself and rehearsed, I realized that is truly an incredibly
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.660]   high calling, especially if we were in a context where we're already suffering.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.180]   We're in a context where we felt needy, right?
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.300]   That would be an incredible high challenge for us.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.740]   Now let's get into some of the details.
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.580]   The first section we have verse 13 and I'll read it again.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:48.580]   It says, therefore preparing your minds for action and being sober minded, set your hope
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:54.780]   fully on the grace that would be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.500]   Now I'm just going to go through these points a bit quickly just so that we get, this is
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.740]   the command and then ask good questions about it.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.020]   The command simply is set your hope fully on the grace, right?
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:11.140]   So we have to kind of mention and we have to take note of the fact that this grace is
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:15.980]   not just a God is gracious, be thankful man, stop complaining about your suffering.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:22.820]   He says very specifically, set your hope on the grace that is to be revealed.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.480]   It's a future grace, right?
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.980]   That's something that you should note here that in this time of suffering, there is a
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:37.260]   need for them to be reminded and we have to remind ourselves a lot too that the grace
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:42.420]   that we receive currently for reconciling with the Holy God, having restoration with
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:49.260]   him, beginning our relationship, we have that as a current reality, but in the full fruition
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:55.780]   of deliverance, we have that as a future hope and that future hope is incredibly vital for
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.780]   every Christian.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:57.780]   Amen.
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:03.460]   Now, if you turn in your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11, famous passage, we've all probably
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.700]   heard it before, but it's good for us to review.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.700]   Hebrews chapter 11 and I'm going to read the first couple of verses, then verse 13 through
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:16.500]   16.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:24.700]   Okay.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:31.140]   Remember that this is a kind of running definition here of faith.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:38.460]   Hebrews chapter 11 verse one says, now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, which
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:46.180]   is an incredibly, or is it a keyword for us and the conviction of things not seen.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.900]   So by the very definitions, not simply of the command to set your hope, but by the very
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:56.580]   definition of what apostle Peter was commending the people, you have this faith that's proved
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:02.980]   ingrained in it as the idea that you are looking forward, that you are desiring to see something
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.300]   that currently you don't see yet.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.260]   Scroll your eyes down to verse 13.
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.940]   After describing the various people from Abraham down to Jacob and all these people, look at
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.260]   what he says.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.500]   Verse 13 through 16.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:22.100]   These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:26.700]   and greeted them from afar and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:32.180]   earth for people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:36.100]   If they had been thinking of the land from which they had gone out, they would have opportunity
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.460]   to return.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:43.060]   But as it is, they desire a better country that is a heavenly one.
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:49.740]   Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God for he has prepared for them a city.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.580]   Quite profound for us to remember.
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.900]   Apostle Peter is commanding the people who currently are seeing, in terms of what they
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.580]   see, the situation is dire.
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.500]   It's crisis situation.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.900]   He says, put your hope on the future grace to come.
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:12.340]   Now a description of that hope, he says fully, fully.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.460]   Right?
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.700]   When I think about that, now we can just make a point and be like, yeah, you just have to
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.860]   like really, really believe it.
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.340]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.580]   But then here's an opportunity for us to do a heart check.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.740]   Because truthfully speaking, in moments of crisis, you reach out for anything that's
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:34.860]   going to save you.
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:41.540]   My son's learning the swimming and survival stuff, and the teachers always tell him, don't
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:45.900]   grab onto the buoy, or don't grab onto the chlorine bottle, or don't grab onto a leaf.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:46.900]   Why?
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.020]   Because the natural tendency is you fall in the water and you'll grab for anything.
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:57.020]   But what happens when you grab on to that little buoy or the leaf?
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.300]   You lose your precious opportunity.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.940]   You lose a precious opportunity to reach out for the wall, something that's secure.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.940]   Right?
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.100]   Yes, we might think like, oh, this isn't it, uh, and then you go over there, but not
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.020]   everybody has that kind of time in the water.
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:16.580]   Likewise, there is an opportunity here for us when Apostle Peter is saying, place your
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.700]   hope fully on the grace to come.
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.900]   There is almost the same corollary, stop putting your hope elsewhere.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.420]   Stop dividing, you know, in terms of an investment of our hope, we're not trying to diversify
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.420]   our portfolio.
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.420]   Right?
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.980]   I got to make sure, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, and then I'll be secure because
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.900]   I'm not banking all my eggs on one basket.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.900]   No.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.120]   Apostle Peter is saying, bank fully on the grace to come.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.500]   As a matter of fact, all things, all things in many ways are going to be fleeting and
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.760]   disappointing as you look to them.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.760]   Okay.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.180]   So there's the command.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:57.240]   Set your hope fully on that future grace that will be revealed at the coming of Christ,
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.240]   right?
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.240]   At the revelation.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.340]   But I have a question for you.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:08.560]   As we look at that passage, he says, therefore, preparing your minds for action and being
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.680]   sober minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.760]   Right?
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:19.760]   So you have these two, what I again kind of mentioned as dependent clauses.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.960]   They're tied to the idea of set your hope.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:30.180]   My question to us is, what's the relationship here between setting your minds on the action
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.920]   or setting, preparing your minds for action and being sober minded?
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.720]   How do those things relate to setting your hope?
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.320]   What I'd like you guys to do is just take a moment to jot down an answer on your paper.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.320]   Okay.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.700]   I'll give you guys like 30 seconds.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.200]   For those of you watching at home, you should do it too.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   Okay.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.200]   [laughter]
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   [pause]
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   Okay.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   [pause]
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   Okay.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   Good.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:39.560]   I hope you guys got an opportunity to, well actually it seems like the majority of you
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:46.560]   guys are still writing.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.560]   [pause]
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:56.560]   Okay.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.560]   Good.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:16.600]   So, the reason why I ask this is because if you compare the different translations, so
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:22.560]   NASB, ESP, and NIV, they kind of all, three of them, read a little bit differently.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   Okay?
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:31.320]   For example, the NIV, okay, gives it to you like a bam, bam, bam, bam, bam command.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.760]   So it'd be like, "Prepare your minds, keep sober, fix your hope."
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.760]   Right?
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.760]   So, it's just straight commands.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.240]   So if I asked you, "Hey, list the commands," you would have just listed those two.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.240]   Okay?
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.720]   And the reason why they did that is because what they saw is this is just a sequence of
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:53.720]   commands that you need to do where the whole concept of having your hope is a faith exercise.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.880]   Setting your hope is a faith exercise.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:01.440]   So the main command is the setting the hope, but as you do it, there's a sequence of the
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.880]   commands that you need to do.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:10.080]   The other translation has the first couple phrases as like a participle, like, "Preparing
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.080]   your mind and keep being sober."
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.120]   And the reason why is because there's a way to look at it where it's like, "How am I supposed
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.120]   to do that?"
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.120]   You know?
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.120]   "I'm at my limit.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.120]   I'm tired."
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.120]   You know?
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.560]   "And you're sitting here commanding me to have hope.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.560]   How do I do that?"
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.960]   And the main command says, "By preparing your mind."
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   You know?
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.080]   "By girding up the loins of your mind and by making sure you're sober."
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.640]   And so what you have is a how-to by doing this.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.840]   What's helpful is sometimes you look at these translations and what's helpful is just being
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:47.120]   able to kind of look up using some of these Bible study tools, like, "Is this word in
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.600]   the Greek a regular imperative or is it a participle?"
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   Okay?
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.520]   I know for some of you guys who really don't like English grammar, you're like, "Dude,
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.000]   what are we doing?
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.600]   It's important, okay?
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.840]   Grammar is really, really important."
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:06.920]   So anyway, in the Greek, those first two phrases are participles showing its dependency or
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.180]   connection to that set your mind.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.080]   But as you think about that, there's something profound to be learned.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.080]   Okay?
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:19.480]   Meaning, yes, there is a sense in which it can be seen as a command because he is asking
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.440]   us to do it nonetheless.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.600]   But it gives you a little bit more detail of how is this idea of setting your hope conceived
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.600]   in the mind of Apostle Peter as he's commanding these individuals where it's difficult for
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.600]   them to have hope.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.600]   Right?
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.920]   And he says, "By preparing your mind."
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.720]   In the Greek, this idea of preparing your mind, he used a very literal term.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.360]   I just kind of mentioned it, "Girding the loins of your mind."
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.040]   And essentially, the way you should have a picture is like when you're about to get in
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.240]   a fight or you're about to run, what do you do?
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.480]   You like get down and you tie your shoelaces, you roll up your sleeves, you know what I
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.480]   mean?
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.320]   So it's the same idiom, like roll up your sleeves.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.320]   What is that saying?
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.320]   Get ready for action.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.240]   What is he saying?
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.680]   Prepare.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.640]   If you have hope in something, guess what?
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.880]   Your hope entails that you will be preparing for it.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.040]   If you are looking forward to eating a delicious steak, what do you do?
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.680]   Get your neck in, get your fork, get your knife in.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.120]   Right?
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.680]   If you're truly anticipating, if you know you're going to be eating it soon, that's
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.440]   what you do.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.720]   How does one set their hope on something?
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.700]   Is they start to prepare.
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.600]   In their minds and in their bodies and in their lives, they start to prepare.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.000]   Hope is not something you wishfully think like, "Oh man, I hope it don't rain tomorrow."
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.960]   That's one way to hope.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.400]   But the other way to hope is, "I'm getting ready for this to come."
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:54.080]   The kind of Christian hope that we're supposed to have is a sure assurance, is a sure faith,
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:59.000]   where it's not just simple, wishful, "I guess if it happens, yay, if it doesn't, so be it"
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.760]   kind of hope.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.760]   The hope that we have of final deliverance, pure joy, and the elation of having Christ
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:13.880]   in our lives, to be so sure, "I've got my belt ready, shoes on, I'm ready to go."
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.680]   That's the way he's talking about it.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.200]   And what you see is, he says, it goes hand in hand, that if you're preparing your mind
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.600]   in that way, it will require sobriety.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.960]   So the two terms that you should place underneath here, this relationship, I guess the relationships
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:37.360]   that I'm talking about here is, yes, I see, eh, set your hope by preparing your mind and
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.360]   by keeping sober.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.280]   Right?
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:48.000]   As you think about keeping sober, I mean, for us, if we throw out the term, like, "Hey,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.720]   you need to be sober," you know, then we're automatically thinking, like, "Yeah, don't
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.400]   be drunk, don't be intoxicated, have your mind clear."
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.760]   But you know that this is far beyond just alcohol.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.280]   Are there things that are deadening your senses?
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.120]   Because truthfully, when I mentioned earlier that this issue of setting hope is vitally
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:12.240]   important because, yes, everybody, not just Christians, but even the people of this world,
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:18.640]   continue to find refuge and hope, escape from suffering, in all kinds of things that make
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.760]   you drunk.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:26.040]   Are there not things like, "Oh my gosh, I had such a rough week, I'm gonna go binge
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.040]   on entertainment."
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.560]   I mean, gluttony, that too, is a problem for a lot of people, where it's just like, "Oh
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.780]   my gosh, I'm so stressed, I'm just gonna eat my sorrows away."
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.760]   People turn to different things for escape and hope.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.960]   And if you do that, how are you going to see what's needed?
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.880]   How are you going to make decisions to prepare?
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:52.720]   How will you have proper and sustaining, lasting hope?
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.440]   We have need for sobriety, we have need to be focused.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.360]   And this I want to make a little bit more, I guess, applicational for us, so by way of
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:07.780]   application, when he says, "Prepare your minds and be sober," you know, there is another
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:15.780]   question that I want to add on to that, which is, "Do you really want what Apostle Peter,
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.620]   what Jesus, and God, is offering?"
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:23.440]   Okay, I'm gonna ask that again.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.020]   When we think about hope, and why we don't have hope in our lives, when we think about
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.220]   suffering and how sometimes those suffering, the experiences of suffering, feels like pits
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:37.940]   we can't get out of, and we don't have joy, I want to add another question to that.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.180]   Not simply, "Are you prepared and are you sober?"
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:49.820]   But, "Do you want what the author of Scripture, what Christ, and what God wants to give you?"
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.820]   Because a lot of times, part of the reason why we are so distracted is because there
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.660]   are things that we're wanting so eagerly.
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.580]   So for example, I'm just gonna use this example, it's a bit silly, just because there's this
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:05.340]   idea of, "Get ready, tie up the loose ends and gird up your mind," like somebody who's
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:11.820]   engaged in athletic competition, imagine somebody who is a boxer, pro athlete, you know how
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.100]   much preparation a boxer needs to have?
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:18.700]   If you guys have ever seen the, you know, video shots of them in the locker room, the
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.380]   coach is in there, wrapping the stuff, the guy's in there like plastering his face with
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:26.100]   that stuff, you know, and they're getting him all ready, tying it up, lacing up his
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.820]   gloves and he can't even get himself ready, there's all these like three or four people
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.660]   getting him ready and then there's a guy who's just there for motivation, he's like, "You
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.660]   can do it!"
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.900]   You know?
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.820]   But imagine he gets in there and he's just getting beat up round one, you know?
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:45.060]   And then so after round one is done, the bell rings, he sits down, the coach is in there,
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.060]   "What are you doing?"
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.060]   And he's still over there looking, he's like, "What are you looking at?"
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.060]   He's looking at the ring girl.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:53.340]   He's like, "Oh man, I lost round one, I was really trying to impress her."
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.340]   You know?
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.180]   And the coach is like, "What are you doing, man?
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.660]   Snap out of it, you gotta get in there and fight!
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.460]   You gotta get in there and look at his moves, respond to his chest movement and his arm
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.380]   movement and how he ducks and stuff like that."
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:11.020]   And he's sitting there like, "Hey, do you see how pretty she looks today?"
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:16.100]   Now the coach is gonna at some point or another be like, "Yeah, get in there, get in there!"
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:20.020]   But a good coach would sit in there and was like, "Do you even want to fight?
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.460]   Do you want to win?
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.180]   If you want to flirt with a girl, just quit now and flirt with her after!"
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:33.400]   So that's what I mean is, that's like, the distraction comes, we're not sober, but that
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:39.220]   typically is revealing of, is there a desire in our heart that's outside of the big hope
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.380]   God is wanting to give us?
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.780]   That's something important for us to consider.
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:52.260]   Now we want to move on here, and I think I just want to summarize that last section with
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:58.300]   "In the end, we kind of want to think about, again, the idea of do we want the right thing?
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.020]   Do we want what God is asking for?"
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.140]   And I just want to make a last point of how that's going to play out is, yeah, sometimes
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:10.100]   we're going to experience suffering, sometimes we're going to experience setback, and I hope
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:17.100]   we have such a setting of our hope fully on what God wants to give us, that our response
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.140]   could easily be, "I wasn't hoping for that anyway."
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.140]   Right?
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:26.620]   That our response could easily be, "I wasn't looking forward to that that much anyhow."
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:31.780]   Rather than a devastation like, "Oh my gosh, I can't believe!"
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.780]   Alright, moving forward to the next section.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:38.260]   Verse 14 through 16.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:45.540]   Let's take a look, and it says, "As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:52.660]   of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:59.460]   conduct, since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'"
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:03.180]   The command is simple, "Be holy."
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:08.220]   And just like someone mentioned right up here, the command goes both negatively and positively.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:15.460]   Positively, be holy, negatively, stop being conformed to your passions and to your ignorance.
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.460]   Right?
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.180]   So, there's a couple ideas here.
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.340]   The command is simple, okay?
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.000]   But these are the hurdles that he explains you have to overcome.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.780]   Some of the greater hurdles that we have to overcome are the passions, the lusts, the
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.860]   desires of our heart that we attach ourselves to.
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.660]   The other hurdle we have to overcome is the ignorance.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:41.340]   A life of not seeing spirituality, a life of not seeing God.
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.580]   Okay?
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.100]   But I want to ask you this question now.
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.100]   Alright, this is a high calling, mehet, right?
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.900]   If there was a high calling, this is a high calling.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.640]   But how do we obtain to this holiness?
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:01.900]   Another way to ask it, I think I put it on your packet, was in this passage, what are
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.700]   the grounds and the foundation of your holiness?
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.780]   Okay?
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:12.260]   So with this one, because it's just an observation from the text, let's just call it out.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.260]   Okay?
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:29.100]   So what do you guys see as grounds or foundations for your personal holiness?
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.700]   Because God is holy.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.820]   Right?
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.860]   Let's put that in there.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:40.300]   God's own character demands.
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:48.380]   God is so holy, his very nature demands holiness from anything around him.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.180]   That's crazy, right?
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.220]   That's just how holy our God is.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:58.220]   But remember, the whole book of Leviticus, and remember our whole study through the BCC2
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.980]   lesson number one, God is so, so holy, right?
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:08.180]   That there is a ramification on anything around him, especially those whom he's called.
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:13.100]   So the passages, he quotes a passage from Leviticus chapter 19, it says, "You be holy
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.380]   because I am holy."
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.500]   That's grounds number one.
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.500]   Great.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.500]   What's another grounds that you see in this passage?
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.260]   Great.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.740]   That does two things.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.740]   Okay?
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.100]   There's three blanks there, grace has given two.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.940]   The second one is the calling.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.020]   Okay?
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.580]   And the third one is the relationship as children.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:43.260]   So yes, God has called us to obedience.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.980]   God has called us to follow.
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.260]   God has called us to be his possession.
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:54.940]   So there's a lot of ways to talk about this calling because it's so rich, you know?
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:31:01.220]   But remember, one of the things that's kind of unique about the book of 1 Peter is that
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.220]   there's a lot of continuity.
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.700]   There's a lot of running themes throughout the whole book, but also themes running through
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.300]   the Old Testament to the New.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:13.580]   God calling a people for himself and calling them to be righteous and calling them to bear
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:19.380]   his name, calling them to be his children, that's not something new in the New Testament.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.500]   He's been doing that from long ago.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:28.900]   And that calling and what God has been doing is a foundation for our holiness.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:34.860]   But lastly, like Grace mentioned, our relationship as his child.
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:39.340]   He says as obedient children, you need to be holy.
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:43.940]   That this relationship with our God and our connection with him demands our holiness.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.300]   Good.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:51.340]   So what we find is these motives, these foundations and basis for our holiness, and he commands
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.220]   that in every way our lives should be marked by holiness.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:59.820]   Now I have lots of other questions, and I'm just going to leave these questions for you
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.420]   for your own personal study, okay?
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.900]   I just want you to think about this.
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.340]   Man, what a high calling.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:14.660]   To what degree does God expect holiness?
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.660]   You know?
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:20.980]   I mean when we read the passage, it says, "As he is holy."
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.860]   Man, what is he expecting from us?
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.900]   If we ask the question, what kind of holiness is he talking about?
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.060]   Because God alone is perfect.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:30.060]   He's unique.
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.540]   He is the epitome of everything.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.620]   He is the definition of justice.
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.860]   He is the definition of purity.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.220]   He is the standard.
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:44.020]   I mean, and he can't be expecting us to be that, can he?
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.060]   Is he just talking about separation from the world?
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.900]   Is he just talking about sexual purity?
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.900]   What is he talking about?
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.580]   These are some good questions to ask.
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.860]   How is this holiness obtained?
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:54.860]   Okay?
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.860]   Earlier, we talked about how do we get this hope?
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.460]   Well, how do we get this holiness?
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:03.620]   I thought it was hard enough to be hopeful when you're under persecution.
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:10.180]   How are we supposed to be holy to this degree and meet up to the calling of God?
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.180]   Lots of questions to ask.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.180]   We have more questions.
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.180]   Yes?
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:21.180]   I have a question related to this.
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.180]   Peter, I'm sorry, Paul, right, I'm so distracted.
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:28.180]   Peter is saying that he's being holy as like an outpour of who we are because God is holy.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.180]   But the verse he quotes says, "You shall be holy."
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.180]   Right.
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.180]   So shall doesn't, is not must.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:39.180]   You know, he couldn't, God could have said, "You need to be."
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.180]   Or, "You must be holy."
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.180]   But he said, "No, you will be."
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.180]   "You shall be."
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:49.180]   So Peter is taking that as a command to do now.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:54.180]   But is this a command or a promise for what we are?
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.180]   Ooh.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.180]   That's good.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.180]   Okay?
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.180]   Good, good.
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.180]   Excellent.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.180]   That's really good.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:06.180]   I mean, looking back into the context, you'll find a lot of different connections too.
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.180]   So that's really great.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:12.180]   Thanks for, and if you guys had other questions, I mean, that's why the scripture is so deep,
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.180]   you know?
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:16.180]   You can sit and just ask a lot of questions and you can just get deeper and deeper into
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.180]   the content of that passage.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.180]   Okay?
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:24.180]   So those are just, you know, questions to help you keep thinking about the passage.
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:27.180]   We're going to move forward just a little bit here.
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.180]   Okay?
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:33.180]   The commando is here, that as obedient children, you should not conform.
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:34.180]   Okay?
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.180]   So, let's hit some applications.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.180]   I have three applications for us.
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:41.180]   And I'm going to run through these quite quickly just for the sake of time.
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:48.180]   The first is you should have a sense of non-conformity.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:51.180]   You should struggle to not conform.
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:57.180]   Because the world around you, the sin in you, is constantly trying to have you submit, yield,
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.180]   and conform to its desires.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.180]   Right?
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:06.180]   So, you may look at this and he has this command, it's like these passions that were yours from
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.180]   before, stop conforming to that thing.
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.180]   You know?
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.180]   Change from that.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:16.180]   So, you should be able to see there's this like, okay, I'm fitting a certain kind of
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:21.180]   mold and I have this system, this natural impulse way of thinking before.
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.180]   Okay?
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.180]   And this is, I'm trying to be a little bit more detailed here because I hope you guys
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:28.180]   identify these things in your own lives as you examine yourself.
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:35.180]   We all have ingrained habitual sins that we have been working under because it made sense
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.180]   to us before.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.180]   Right?
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.180]   We have natural reactions to people hurting us.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.180]   We have defense mechanisms.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.180]   We have, you know, pursuit and ambition mechanisms.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.180]   We have mechanisms for our arrogance and our pride and how we view ourselves.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:52.180]   We have lots of ways in which we naturally reacted by impulse according to our old way
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.180]   of thinking.
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:59.180]   But now that you know, now that you know God, you've seen God, you've received his grace,
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:04.180]   you know his plans of mercy, you've seen God's, you know, Christ's sacrifice and his redemption
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.180]   and his resurrection, your system of thought has to change.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:12.180]   So stop conforming to those things and you have to start, start conforming to the system
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:16.180]   and that of Christ, the truth of the Lord.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.180]   That's number one.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:28.180]   But number two, he says in every aspect of your conduct, you must be holy.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:37.180]   By way of application for us, just as the hope that we set is fully encompassing, all
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:43.180]   of our hope is encompassing into the future grace, our holiness is all encompassing over
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.180]   our lives.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:49.180]   So, when he's calling and challenging us to be holy, he's not just talking about sexual
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.180]   morality.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:54.180]   And he's not just talking about, "Hey, did you go to a, you know, unholy liberal church
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.180]   before?
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.180]   Make sure you go to a conservative one."
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:01.180]   No, he's talking about every facet of your life, every context of your life.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:06.180]   If you're two different people at like your business and then at church, if you're two
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:12.180]   different people at home versus, you know, out in public, in every facet.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:18.180]   But lastly, even when you suffer, be holy.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:21.180]   The fact of the matter is, I think this is an application point for us.
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.180]   Sometimes I kind of ask myself this question, "Huh?
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:32.180]   Why did Apostle Peter feel the need to command the people who are suffering to be holy?"
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:39.180]   And then, I quickly realized what my tendency is, and I'm pretty sure there are a lot of
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:44.180]   people who have this tendency, which is, when you have hardship, those are the times when
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.180]   your mind excuses sin.
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.180]   Right?
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:53.180]   When you suffer, those are the times when your excuses all of a sudden gain better weight
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.180]   or something.
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.180]   It starts to make more sense.
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:59.180]   "Oh my gosh, you can't believe, you know, what a rough day I had.
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.180]   I need my time.
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.180]   Don't bother me."
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:09.180]   You know, it's like, it's rationalized and reasonable for me to not be holy because I
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.180]   have every good excuse.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:17.180]   A lot of times, whether it's, you know, I'm counseling people who struggle with different,
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:21.180]   maybe even sexual immoral things to their temperament.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:24.180]   Maybe it's, you know, whatever it may be.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.180]   Yeah, they have their reasons.
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.180]   They have their excuses.
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.180]   But God is calling us to higher standards.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:37.180]   God is calling us to think more deeply into the future grace, and God desires for us to
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:41.180]   be sober and for us to make sure that we are prepared.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:46.180]   And so earlier, in the kind of pre-discussion, I asked, "Is there any logical connection
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:51.180]   between set your hope, be holy, and then the last one, which is live in fear?
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.180]   Conduct yourselves in the fear of God."
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.180]   Right?
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.180]   And I think there is.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:39:01.180]   In many ways, setting your hope requires you to make sure that you're practicing that faith,
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:06.180]   practicing that assurance of what's to come, and then making sure that your mind is sober
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.180]   and clear of all the filth of the world.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.180]   Well, guess what?
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:13.180]   You absolutely need holiness in your life.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:21.180]   As a matter of fact, Scripture teaches us that it is, it is this, this, you know what?
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:24.180]   I'm just going to save that for a little bit later.
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:28.180]   The transition to the next part, he says here in 2 Corinthians 7, I think I have it in your
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:35.180]   passage, that we require these three things in our lives for us to come really into this
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:40.180]   perfection, that even when it comes to our holiness, it is perfected by our fear of God.
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.180]   I'm going to read it for us here.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:48.180]   It says in 2 Corinthians 7, verse 1, "Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:55.180]   ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.180]   of God."
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.180]   So he has all the concepts of the commands of 1 Peter.
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:03.180]   Apostle Paul likewise sees we have these promises that we are hoping for.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:09.180]   We're cleansing ourselves from the defilement, perfecting holiness in the fear of the Lord.
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.180]   They feed each other.
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:18.180]   If you aren't having a sanctified spiritual mind, it's so difficult for you to have any
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.180]   hope.
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:25.180]   But what's more, in terms of your holiness, it won't come to fruition unless you have
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:29.180]   a clear view of God that produces reverent fear in your heart.
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:33.180]   Let's move forward to the next section then, as we tie it all together, as we conclude
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.180]   on this last part.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.180]   Okay?
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:46.180]   Verse 17, "And if you call on him as father who judges impartially, according to each
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:52.180]   one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile, knowing
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:57.180]   that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:02.180]   perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.180]   that of a lamb without blemish or spot.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:10.180]   He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was made manifest in the last
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:17.180]   times for the sake of you, through him are believers in God who raised him from the dead
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:22.180]   and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God."
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:27.180]   What's really interesting is this is one of those long run-on sentences, and typically
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:32.180]   I imagine, as an apostle Peter, as somebody who preached powerfully, you read the book
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:36.180]   of Acts and stuff, when you're doing this long run-on sentence, I imagine him getting
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:39.180]   all fiery and, you know, ramped up with passion.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:45.180]   But he says, "If you call on him as father and he judges impartially, according to everyone's
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:51.180]   deeds, the command is, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile."
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:56.180]   Your entire life here, conduct yourself in a way where it's marked by a reverent fear
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.180]   of God.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.180]   Okay?
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:02.180]   And again, there are some running themes.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.180]   The motives are stuff that we've already seen.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:09.180]   As a matter of fact, if you're, you know, kind of making your observations, some of
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:13.180]   these words you should have probably circled and said, "Hey, I've seen these before."
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:18.180]   This idea of being ransomed, this idea of perishable versus imperishable things, the
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:24.180]   preciousness of Christ's blood, the foreknowing, remember how God, he has chosen us, the foreknowledge
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.180]   of God and whatnot.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.180]   These are all things we've seen before.
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.180]   So I listed them for you.
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:33.180]   If you call him father, you have this relationship, just like with the last one.
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:40.180]   If you are his children, what's more, because God is impartial, this is added onto, allotted
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.180]   for us.
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:45.180]   That means, just because you're his child doesn't mean God's going to be lenient to
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.180]   you.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.180]   He's not being like, "Oh, my little baby."
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:54.180]   Well, God does see us as precious, but that doesn't mean he's going to compromise his
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.180]   justice.
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:59.180]   His judgment is going to be sure, his judgment is going to be exacting.
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.180]   He says, "According to each one's deeds."
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:06.180]   But what's more, in this passage he says, "The motive for you to conduct your life in
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:12.180]   fear is that you are freed from your futile, empty pattern of life.
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:17.180]   Your motivation to live in a reverent fear of God is that you know you are redeemed with
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:26.180]   the precious, undefiled, imperishable blood of Christ, the priceless blood of the Lord.
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:32.180]   And lastly, your motive to live your life in reverent fear of God is that your hope,
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:38.180]   your faith and hope are the result of God's eternal plan to raise and glorify his son,
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:40.180]   Jesus Christ."
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:44.180]   Now, I listed those down because I want to ask an important question.
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.180]   How can you explain this?
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.180]   This is so interesting.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:52.180]   He says, "Live your life and conduct yourselves in reverent fear."
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:58.180]   Well, that's interesting because the motivation behind all this is the same stuff he said
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.180]   before.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:05.180]   So what's interesting is the motivations that we have to hope, you know, all the blessings,
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:10.180]   imperishable inheritance and all that kind of stuff, was a motivation for our hope.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:17.180]   But he's now referencing them that these same motivations would be for our fear.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:25.180]   Would you guys take about two minutes in your groups to try to explain how are these motives
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:30.180]   the same cause and grounds for both our hope and our fear?
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.180]   Go ahead.
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:34.180]   [Coughing]
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.180]   [Coughing]
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:39.180]   [Coughing]
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.180]   [Coughing]
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:57.180]   [Coughing]
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.180]   [Coughing]
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:25.180]   [Coughing]
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:29.180]   [Coughing]
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:42.180]   [Coughing]
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:55.180]   [Coughing]
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:46:10.180]   [Coughing]
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:18.180]   [Laughter]
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:22.180]   [Laughter]
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:28.180]   [Laughter]
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:35.180]   [Coughing]
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:47.180]   [Coughing]
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.180]   [Coughing]
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:47:08.180]   [Coughing]
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:11.180]   [Coughing]
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:30.180]   [Coughing]
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:35.180]   [Laughter]
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:38.180]   [Laughter]
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:48:00.180]   [Laughter]
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:03.180]   [Laughter]
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:29.180]   [Laughter]
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.180]   [Laughter]
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:45.180]   [Laughter]
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:51.180]   [Laughter]
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.180]   [Laughter]
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:21.180]   Okay. Looks like you guys are maybe wrapping up with some of your discussion there.
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:32.180]   So, as we think about this, you know, we are thinking just kind of deeply of how are these motivations playing
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:37.180]   into the application that Apostle Peter is challenging these believers, you know?
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:45.180]   And you'll notice there is this balance here where you have this hoping in and this kind of endearing like,
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:49.180]   "Oh, we're going to receive the promises, the loving promises that God has for us."
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:55.180]   But on the flip side, there is this like fear that God's going to exact His judgment
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:59.180]   and He's not going to show leniency just because and show partiality, right?
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:04.180]   But then He says, "As you apply these things, remember the same stuff.
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:10.180]   You're born, you know, by the grace of God. You're redeemed by the precious blood."
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:19.180]   And there is this kind of story I want to share with you to kind of bring those two thoughts together, so to speak.
[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:24.180]   And the story is a fake story, so let's just imagine it as like a movie, okay?
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:26.180]   Bum, bum, bum, action movie.
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:29.180]   Imagine that there is this general, okay?
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:34.180]   Four-star war veteran general who had a young daughter, precious.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.180]   He adored her, loved her.
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:43.180]   But the enemies of his nation came and sent their mercenaries and kidnapped her and asked for a ransom, you know?
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:46.180]   And the enemies wanted everything, not just a million, ten million.
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:51.180]   They wanted everything the general had, like literally everything.
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:54.180]   So the general is sitting here thinking, "This is my daughter."
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.180]   Of course.
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:58.180]   So he empties out his savings for retirement.
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.180]   He empties out his checking account.
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:08.180]   And then that's still not enough because the people who want the ransom, they're saying, "Yeah, that's a ton of money, but we want everything you got because we've got it all for you."
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.180]   Right?
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:12.180]   So he's got to sell his house. He's got to sell his car.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.180]   And then the general, you know, he's got men.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.180]   He's got special forces.
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:20.180]   And the special forces of guys are saying, they're like, "We could just send a drone and bomb that thing," you know?
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:26.180]   And the general says, "No. For risk of harming my daughter, we're going to pay this ransom."
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:28.180]   So they make this deal.
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:38.180]   And then the people who are the enemies bring over the girl to a little transaction spot where they're going to do the exchange.
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:41.180]   The general comes with all the money and stuff like that.
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.180]   And the scene is intense.
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:47.180]   It's one of those anime where they're like, "Gah! Gah!"
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:53.180]   And then the girl finally appears from the car and she looks disheveled and distraught.
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:56.180]   And then the enemies are saying, "You have all the money."
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.180]   And it's like, "Just take it. Give me just the girl," you know?
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:06.180]   And now the girl, rather than, when she's released, running over, she's just slowly dragging her feet and looking back.
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:11.180]   And then you can see her mouth over to the enemies like, "Hey, I'll call you."
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:14.180]   And you're like, "What? What's going on?"
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:20.180]   And you're surprised because rather than embracing the father, she gives him this dirty look like, "Tsss."
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:26.180]   She gets into the jeep, you know, the military jeep, and then all of a sudden she starts to mouth off at the father like,
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:31.180]   "Oh, you dirty jeep! You couldn't pick me up in something nicer?
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:33.180]   And why did you take so long?
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:37.180]   You're the general, aren't you? Couldn't you have called somebody?"
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:40.180]   She has no idea what the father had done.
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:43.180]   She had no idea what the father just lost.
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:51.180]   Now in that moment, what you have is the complete opposite of what God expects.
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.180]   Right?
[00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:59.180]   Because God does not want just this terrifying fear of like, "Oh my gosh, it's the general!"
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:02.180]   Because then what? That would not be the right relationship.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:06.180]   It's the daughter and the father.
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:11.180]   But God also doesn't expect like, "Oh, thanks, Dad. That's nice of you.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.180]   Could have come a little faster though."
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:16.180]   Why? Because that's no fear.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.180]   That's disrespect.
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:21.180]   Constantly diminishing the plans of the father.
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.180]   Like, "Couldn't you have done better?"
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:25.180]   And we tend to do that.
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:29.180]   Every time we sit and ask the question like, "Why God are you doing what you're doing?"
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:32.180]   We constantly try to question God.
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:35.180]   "What are you doing? Don't you have better plans?"
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:43.180]   And we just cannot diminish God's authority, His precision, His strength, His sovereignty like that.
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:45.180]   Why? Because that's not fearful.
[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:47.180]   It's not reverential.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:51.180]   And we can't be the kind, like this kind of girl in the story, the fake story,
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:54.180]   who is completely thankless.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.180]   Who doesn't understand and doesn't get the reality.
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:00.180]   Look how much your father just sacrificed to pull you out.
[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:02.180]   But here you are looking back.
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:05.180]   Already having made deals. Already having emotional attachments.
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:09.180]   "Maybe I'll call you back, okay?"
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:13.180]   That depicts sometimes our relationship with the world.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:19.180]   But what God calls for is a reverential fear that's in the context of our loving relationship with our God.
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:24.180]   But we're not so fearful. We can't run into His arm embracing Him because He saved us.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.180]   Yet at the same time, we're not so disrespectful.
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:30.180]   We climb up on Him however we want.
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:32.180]   Right?
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:38.180]   There is a harmony of the grace that we receive and the fear that we exhibit towards our God.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:42.180]   Especially when we see, "Oh my gosh.
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:47.180]   This powerful God of the universe has sacrificed so much.
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:52.180]   Something immeasurable. Something that truly cannot be repaid.
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:57.180]   The blood of His Son."
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:02.180]   I share this all the time in my BCC class and every time that I get.
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:06.180]   For us, sometimes after we sin, we feel this incredible sense of fear.
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:09.180]   After we sin, and then we feel a sense of guilt.
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.180]   And then we do things to appease our shame and guilt.
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:16.180]   That's not godly fear and that's not doing anything for your relationship with God.
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:22.180]   Because anytime we're trying to rectify guilt and shame through the means of worldly fear,
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:26.180]   where it's just a fear of like, "I feel the shame."
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:28.180]   Then it's not helping anything.
[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:32.180]   All that's doing is the same thing that the Hebrews a long time ago did
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:36.180]   when they were thinking that they would pay somehow God with animal sacrifice.
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:42.180]   Or even the Catholics who think that by their penance, they would somehow rectify the situation with their God.
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:46.180]   What that's like is saying, "I will pay for your son.
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:50.180]   Sorry. My bad."
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:54.180]   That would be so incredibly offensive.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:57.180]   But instead, when we have godly fear,
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:02.180]   and say, "What I'm more ashamed of is that I would disrespect you, my loving God."
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:04.180]   Right?
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:08.180]   "What I'm more afraid of is to be at odds with you, my loving Father."
[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:12.180]   That's the kind of godly fear we hope to have in our lives.
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.180]   And so Apostle Peter says,
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:22.180]   "In this day and age, while we have time, conduct yourselves in the fear of God.
[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:27.180]   Live in this relationship with the Lord where you can run to Him,
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:31.180]   and yet you make sure that you still regard Him and revere Him."
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:34.180]   And I just want to conclude by saying, really,
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:37.180]   what I find pretty amazing about this stuff is,
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.180]   I'm going to be honest,
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:41.180]   when you experience hardship,
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:46.180]   some of these things really will feel like, "I don't know if I can do that."
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:51.180]   Remember, even the thing such as hope,
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:55.180]   it was placed in this passage to us like a command.
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:56.180]   Right?
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:57:01.180]   It was something that's placed as God expecting and desiring for us to do this,
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:05.180]   not by way of like, "Oh, you can do this in your own power."
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:07.180]   But regularly, God is going to challenge us.
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:12.180]   What you feel and what you experience, like you can't in the power of man,
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:16.180]   God will empower us through His gospel and His grace. Amen?
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.180]   Let's take a moment to pray.
