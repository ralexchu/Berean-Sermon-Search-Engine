[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.000]   - Good evening, everybody.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.440]   Glad to see everybody this night.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.840]   Let us go ahead and get seated and situated,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.300]   and then we'll start off with a word of prayer.
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.880]   All right, would you please join with me?
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.480]   Heavenly Father, we want to pray to you
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.280]   a word of thanksgiving.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.480]   God, we are, again, so grateful that you're merciful to us,
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.200]   that, Lord, your presence is with us
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.880]   and that you sustain us.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.840]   We ask, Lord God, as each day has its own worries,
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.960]   burdens, troubles, and more,
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.320]   God, help us to really focus our minds,
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.320]   focus our hearts on you.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.040]   And we pray, Lord, one of the great struggles is
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.240]   sometimes we're fatigued and our desires may wane,
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.940]   but help us, Lord God, to have such a desire,
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.120]   a desire to learn from your word,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.120]   desire to have true fellowship,
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.420]   and, God, a desire to give you worship.
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.600]   Lord, we're thankful for the Bible study
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.520]   and ask that we would glean much.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.680]   And now, as we sing songs of worship to you,
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.940]   we do pray that it would be pleasing to your ear.
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.520]   It's in Christ's name, amen.

[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.940]   Father, we just thank You for this time of worship
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.220]   and Bible study.
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.460]   We just lift Your praise to You and You alone
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.220]   'cause You deserve all the praise, God,
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.660]   and You are holy, holy, holy, just like we sang.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.900]   And God, as we just sing about one church, one faith,
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.500]   one name that saves, God, which is Christ Jesus,
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.020]   I pray that You will truly unite us
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.900]   in our desire to just learn about the church
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.220]   the way You've designed it in Your Word,
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.180]   and that we would just truly grow in just Christ being King
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.660]   and Lord of our lives, Lord.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.900]   I would just thank You for this time.
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.340]   I would just give You all the glory, Lord.
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.900]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:07.620]   All right, just a brief announcement for us.
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.860]   So we do need some helping hands,
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.580]   so here's a volunteer opportunity for you guys.
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.820]   In order to have this set up, we do need helping hands
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.780]   to help us prepare.
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.820]   We have facility preparers who are setting up tables
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.260]   on the other side, chairs, et cetera.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.020]   If you can, please sign up, the link is here,
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.900]   but also, if you check your emails,
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.820]   when we started the Bible study,
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.460]   you should have gotten a link for a schedule.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.500]   Now, it is a little different
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.220]   because it's a big old spreadsheet
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.180]   with parking volunteers, et cetera,
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.900]   but take a look at that spreadsheet,
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.140]   and there's also opportunities to help clean up
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.540]   at the end of the day.
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.020]   So we're requesting that you guys look at your schedules,
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.340]   look for a day where you can come early
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.420]   or just stay behind a little bit after to help clean, okay?
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.700]   But we do need helping hands right away,
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.740]   so please make sure you sign up for that, okay?
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.300]   All right, so please go ahead at this time
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.980]   to discuss just your observations
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.220]   from the various quiet time passages,
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.860]   and also discuss what you learned
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.300]   from the two chapters of reading,
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.860]   and then we'll be back at eight o'clock.
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.700]   Thanks, everyone.

[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:50.620]   - All right, let's get together.
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:52.620]   It's eight o'clock.
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:55.780]   (audience chattering)

[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:31.580]   (audience chattering)
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:43.420]   All right, let me get started here.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:47.420]   It's at eight o'clock, a little bit over eight.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:51.420]   All right, let me pray for us and we'll get started.
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.420]   Father, we thank you for this evening,
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:58.420]   and as we take this time to discuss the First Covenant
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:01.420]   and the importance of church membership,
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:04.420]   we pray, Father God, for a deeper understanding
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.420]   of who you are to us.
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.420]   We pray that you would sanctify us and teach us
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:12.420]   that we may be intentional in the way
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.420]   that we build this church for the sake of your name.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:17.420]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.420]   Ah.
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.420]   Ah.
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.420]   It's okay?
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.420]   Okay, all right.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.420]   All right, so today we're gonna be covering
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.420]   the First Covenant.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.420]   The First Covenant is I confess Jesus Christ
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.420]   as my Lord and Savior.
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.420]   Those of you who are new to the church,
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.420]   and I know there's quite a few
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.420]   who are non-members of the church,
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:39.420]   and so at our church we have membership,
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:41.420]   and at the end of the membership,
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.420]   eight-week membership,
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:45.420]   which is actually starting in a few weeks.
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.420]   I forgot which, in about three weeks
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:50.420]   we're starting a new class of membership,
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.420]   so those of you who've been waiting,
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.420]   we're gonna start taking sign-ups this Sunday,
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:55.420]   and so it's an eight-week course
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:58.420]   where we go over the various aspects of the church,
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.420]   what our church is about,
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.420]   and then at the end of the eight weeks
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:06.420]   we go over the Tenfold Covenant,
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:10.420]   and this covenant is basically what we are expecting
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:13.420]   all the members of the church to commit to,
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.420]   and we renew this every year,
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.420]   and the reason why we do this
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.420]   is so that the building of the church
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.420]   is very intentional,
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.420]   that we're not simply adding numbers to the church,
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.420]   we're not simply asking people to come
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.420]   because they like the fellowship,
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.420]   or they like the people,
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:29.420]   or they just want to sit in service,
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.420]   and this is the teaching.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:33.420]   All of those things are great,
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.420]   but we want to build the church very intentionally,
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.420]   so the Tenfold Covenant that we're gonna go over
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:40.420]   through this round of Bible study
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.420]   from now until wintertime
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.420]   are all commitments that we're asking every member
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.420]   to participate in,
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.420]   and take it very seriously,
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.420]   not to just sign the covenant,
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:54.420]   but to sign it with intention of practicing it,
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.420]   and so that's the main reason
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:58.420]   why we are going over this covenant, okay?
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:01.420]   So the first covenant is I confess Jesus Christ
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.420]   as my Lord and Savior,
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.420]   so the first covenant is that the members of the church
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.420]   has to be genuine Christians,
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.420]   that we're not simply adding people,
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.420]   but that these are not just confessing,
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.420]   but that there's evidence of this in your life,
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.420]   so the question today is not gonna be
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:21.420]   about lordship necessarily,
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:25.420]   it's gonna be about why we practice membership, okay?
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.420]   Why do we practice membership?
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.420]   Some of you guys may have come from churches
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:30.420]   that don't practice membership.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.420]   Maybe you went to church all your life,
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.420]   and membership is kind of a new concept to you, right?
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:38.420]   It sounds weird to have a church be exclusive,
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:41.420]   so you may have come from a paradigm thinking
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:44.420]   that why is this church only allowing
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:45.420]   some people to be members,
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.420]   some people not to be members,
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.420]   and I'm gonna be explaining that,
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.420]   so hopefully at the end of this Bible study,
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:53.420]   whether you agree or don't agree,
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:55.420]   that you at least understand
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:03:00.420]   why we feel the need to practice membership, okay?
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:05.420]   First of all, the word for church itself in Greek
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:09.420]   is ekklesia, ekklesia, and it's the two words.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.420]   Ekk means to be out of.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.420]   Klesia is a gathering,
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.420]   and so the literal understanding of the meaning
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:20.420]   is an assembly of people who have been called out, right?
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:22.420]   That's a literal understanding of the word,
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:25.420]   and so when Jesus uses this word to describe the church,
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:27.420]   it's very deliberate.
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.420]   It's not just any gathering.
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.420]   It's not just wherever people gather together, right?
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:34.420]   Or some people think the church is
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:37.420]   because it's inside of you,
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.420]   I just make wherever two or three gather together,
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.420]   that's where the church is, right?
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:43.420]   But the literal understanding of this word
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.420]   is a assembly.
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.420]   It is an assembly.
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:48.420]   It is not just how you feel,
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:49.420]   your personal relationship with God.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.420]   You hear all the time people saying
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.420]   Christianity is just your personal relationship with God.
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:55.420]   It is not.
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:58.420]   That is a part of it, right?
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.420]   It is not just your personal relationship with God.
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:04.420]   The church is a gathering of people
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:05.420]   who are called out.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.420]   It is a gathering.
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.420]   So you yourself is not a church.
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.420]   You're a Christian, but you're not a church.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.420]   You can have a Bible study at your home,
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:16.420]   that doesn't make it a church.
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:19.420]   There are very specific things about what the Bible says,
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.420]   what a church looks like.
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:23.420]   So again, just the meaning itself of the church,
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:26.420]   and this term was not created by Christ.
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.420]   This term was already used in the culture,
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.420]   and it was used for an assembly
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.420]   of a political gathering, right?
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:36.420]   Kind of like what we say today,
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:38.420]   like the assembly of so-and-so,
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.420]   assembly of California,
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:41.420]   the assembly members of Congress,
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.420]   men and women of the United States,
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:47.420]   and these are people who are gathering together, right?
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:48.420]   They left their home.
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:51.420]   They gather together for a particular purpose,
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:54.420]   and that term was used by Christ
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:57.420]   to refer to the gathering of Christians
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:59.420]   who have been called out from the world
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:01.420]   for a specific purpose.
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:03.420]   That's the definition of a church.
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.420]   1 Peter 2, 9 through 10, it says,
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:10.420]   "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.420]   "a holy nation, a people for God's own possession,
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:17.420]   "so that you may proclaim the excellencies of him
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:20.420]   "who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.420]   "For you once were not a people,
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:24.420]   "but now you are the people of God.
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.420]   "You had not received mercy,
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.420]   "but now you have received mercy."
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:29.420]   This is a description of God's people.
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:33.420]   God had called us out, made us a chosen race,
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:36.420]   a royal priesthood, a nation that belongs to God
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:43.420]   to proclaim his excellency for his glory
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.420]   from darkness, from where you were
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:49.420]   before you met Christ, into the light, right?
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.420]   And so, again, this is another way
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:55.420]   of understanding what a church is.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:06:02.420]   I asked you to do quiet time, right?
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:04.420]   Just let me give you a little bit of a plug
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.420]   on the quiet time.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:11.420]   In your walk with God, there is nothing
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:15.420]   that will affect your walk with God,
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:19.420]   a single activity that will affect your walk with God
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:23.420]   more than your personal devotion.
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:25.420]   And I'm not looking at scripture.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:27.420]   There's no verse I'm telling.
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:29.420]   I'm just telling you from my personal experience
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:32.420]   and from years of just trying to disciple people.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.420]   If there's a single activity that you are not doing
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:40.420]   that you will commit to on a daily basis,
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:45.420]   that will radically change your spiritual life
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:48.420]   is your personal devotion before God.
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:52.420]   So if you're active at church, evangelizing,
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:54.420]   serving other people, giving,
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:58.420]   and yet you're not spending personal time with God
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:02.420]   on a daily basis, I guarantee you, right,
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.420]   there's no single activity that you will commit to
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:08.420]   that will make the most practical difference
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:11.420]   in your life than your personal devotion with God.
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:13.420]   And again, this is a plug.
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:15.420]   So whatever it is that you're engaging in,
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:21.420]   I would say make your personal time with God a priority.
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.420]   If you say, you know what, all these verses are burdensome
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:26.420]   or it's just too much, I have this, I have that activity,
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:29.420]   I would say make this the highest of your priority.
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:33.420]   Outside of corporate worship,
[01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:36.420]   the second most important thing that you will do in life
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:39.420]   is your personal time with God, okay?
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:42.420]   And I can't emphasize that enough, right?
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.420]   So if you're not doing that, you want to be disciple,
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:46.420]   I want to grow, I'm seeking counsel,
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:50.420]   if you're not doing this, do this first, okay?
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.420]   Do this first, and then seek discipleship,
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.420]   and then seek counsel, and then seek whatever it is
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.420]   that you're seeking, okay?
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:58.420]   I hope I emphasized that strong enough
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:01.420]   that you understand that this is that important, right?
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:04.420]   Now, I understand that you may have other devotions
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:06.420]   that you are doing, I understand that,
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:09.420]   so you may not be able to devote as much time onto this,
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:11.420]   but again, if that is not the case,
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:14.420]   I would strongly recommend every day
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:17.420]   try to spend at least 15, 20, 30 minutes,
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:21.420]   and then possibly more than that going forward, right?
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:24.420]   Study, pray on a regular basis,
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:26.420]   and if there's anything that you will do in life
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:29.420]   that will single-handedly enhance your walk with God
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:32.420]   is your personal devotion, okay?
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:36.420]   That's completely just off-tangent, but all right.
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.420]   So let me go through this.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.420]   The church is initiated and preserved
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:42.420]   by God's covenant prophets.
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:45.420]   This is where Jesus asks Peter who he is,
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:47.420]   and he gives a confession that says,
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:49.420]   "Upon this rock I will build my church,
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:52.420]   "and gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.420]   So...
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:09:02.420]   So the first thing
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:06.420]   is that the church is initiated by God.
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:09.420]   This was not man-made, right?
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.420]   This was not just some, you know,
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:13.420]   the church got together, or the group of people
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.420]   who became Christians said, "Well, how are we going to
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.420]   "organize the church? What are we going to do?"
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.420]   And then they came up with this system.
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:22.420]   He says, "No, this was introduced to us by Christ himself."
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:24.420]   Number two, the church is a gathering of people
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:26.420]   who have confessed Jesus as Lord and Savior
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:28.420]   and believe that Jesus was crucified
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.420]   and resurrected for our sins.
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:34.420]   There--oftentimes when people criticize
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.420]   that Christians are like this,
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.420]   or churches are like this,
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:42.420]   how much of that criticism
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:45.420]   is about non-Christians?
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.420]   How much of the hatred of the world
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.420]   toward the church
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:53.420]   is really about non-Christians in the church?
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.420]   Right? Now, we don't know,
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.420]   because there's so much mixture of it,
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.420]   where we don't know where the church begins
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:03.420]   and the non--you know, non-Christians start.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.420]   So because we have saturated the church
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.420]   with non-Christians,
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.420]   that they can't tell the difference between
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.420]   what a church is and what the world is,
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:14.420]   because there is no distinction, right?
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:17.420]   And so the church is a gathering of people
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:21.420]   who have confessed that Christ is their Lord
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:24.420]   and believe that Jesus is resurrected from the dead.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.420]   That's the nature of the church.
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:30.420]   A gathering of people who have not confessed
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:33.420]   Christ as Lord and Savior is not a church.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.420]   It is just a gathering.
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.420]   It is not a church, right?
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:40.420]   And so when people often ask,
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:43.420]   "How come our church isn't concerned
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.420]   about non-Christians who are coming
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.420]   to our Sunday worship?"
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:49.420]   It's not that we're not concerned,
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:53.420]   but Sunday worship is not designed for non-Christians,
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.420]   because we call it worship,
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:59.420]   and non-Christians do not come to worship, right?
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:02.420]   So Sunday worship is for worship.
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:04.420]   So non-Christians can come, they can sit there,
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:07.420]   they can ask questions, and we can evangelize to them,
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.420]   but Sunday worship is worship for Christians, okay?
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:14.420]   And so it's not that we don't care about them,
[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:16.420]   but we can't call it worship
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:19.420]   and then have the main target for the worship non-Christians.
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:22.420]   Then it's a contradiction in terms, okay?
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:25.420]   Three, their church is a gathering of people
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:27.420]   for the purpose of worship, as we said.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:30.420]   John 4, 7-26, this is a passage
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.420]   where Jesus is encountering the Samaritan woman.
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:34.420]   They go back and forth.
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:36.420]   She recognizes that He's the Messiah,
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.420]   and He says to the Samaritan woman
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.420]   that there's going to come a time
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.420]   when God is looking for people
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:46.420]   who will worship Him in spirit and in truth, right?
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:48.420]   Both.
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.420]   The reason why Jesus says spirit and in truth
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.420]   is because the Samaritans believed
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:55.420]   that their heart was in the right place.
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:57.420]   Jesus says the Jews have the truth
[01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:59.420]   because they have the Word of God.
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:01.420]   They have the law.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:06.420]   And the Samaritans have a version of it of their own.
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:09.420]   But He was basically rebuking both.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.420]   The Jews were worshiping
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.420]   based on what they thought was the law.
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:16.420]   Samaritans may have had the right heart,
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:19.420]   but what God is looking for are genuine worshipers
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:22.420]   who will worship in spirit and in truth, right?
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:24.420]   So that's the primary thing
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:28.420]   that He says He's looking for in the church, right?
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:31.420]   Are people very well-educated?
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:33.420]   Are they obedient? Are they giving?
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:36.420]   All these things are important things that the Bible teaches.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.420]   But the primary thing that God is looking for,
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:42.420]   how does God determine a good church versus a bad church?
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:45.420]   Right? Programs?
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.420]   Feeding the poor?
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:51.420]   How do you determine it's a good church or a bad church?
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.420]   Expository preaching?
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:56.420]   All these things are good things,
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:59.420]   but ultimately what God is looking for is
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:02.420]   are the people in this church genuinely worshiping God
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.420]   in spirit and in truth, right?
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:07.420]   So obviously you're going to require the teaching.
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:09.420]   You're going to require discipleship.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:11.420]   But the primary thing that God will determine
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:14.420]   that's a good church versus this church is not a good church
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:20.420]   is genuine worship of spirit and truth happening, right?
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:24.420]   What happens to a church that worships in spirit
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:27.420]   but not in truth?
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:30.420]   If you understand what I'm saying.
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:33.420]   Your intentions are good, right?
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:36.420]   You cry every time you go to worship God.
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:40.420]   You raise your hand and you sing and your praise is awesome.
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.420]   But they lack truth.
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:44.420]   They don't know the Word of God.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.420]   What happens to a church that is worshiping in spirit
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:53.420]   but not in truth?
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:57.420]   Somebody.
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:59.420]   Charismatic, okay.
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:03.420]   I was looking for something more specific.
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:07.420]   Why is that dangerous?
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:10.420]   Huh?
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:14.420]   Okay, yeah, I'm looking for something more specific.
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:17.420]   Something more dangerous.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.420]   Heresy, right?
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:25.420]   All these--the people who are flocking to cults
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:28.420]   because the cults seem more passionate and sincere
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:31.420]   than the church that they came from.
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:35.420]   They go to the--so many people who end up going to cults
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:37.420]   used to go to a church.
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.420]   And they say, "You know what?
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:41.420]   "The people there, they're not really sincere.
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:43.420]   "They don't practice what they preach."
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:45.420]   But these people really practice.
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:46.420]   They actually go witnessing.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.420]   They actually pray.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:48.420]   They actually give.
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:50.420]   That's what draws them there.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:52.420]   And even though you go through the Scripture and say,
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:54.420]   "Well, Scripturally, they're all--you know, this is wrong
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.420]   "and they're interpreting this wrong."
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.420]   They said, "Well, but they're very sincere.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:00.420]   "They're the most sincere people I've ever met.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.420]   "They're very loving.
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:03.420]   "Community is awesome."
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:06.420]   But the problem with that is when they don't have truth,
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:10.420]   they're open to all kinds of heresy.
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:13.420]   What happens to a church that practices truth
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:18.420]   but not spirit?
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:22.420]   Legalism.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:24.420]   It's a dead church.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:26.420]   It's a dead church.
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:27.420]   So what if you have right doctrine?
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:30.420]   So what if you have right teaching?
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.420]   He doesn't want us to come and check off the box and say,
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:37.420]   "Oh, everybody with right doctrine come to heaven."
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.420]   Even the demons believe that and they shudder.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:42.420]   They have better doctrine than we do.
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:43.420]   It's a dead church.
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:45.420]   Either way, it's dangerous.
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.420]   He said what God is looking for are people who will worship him
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:50.420]   in spirit and in truth.
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:53.420]   So if you have truth and you don't have passion
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:56.420]   and you don't have zeal for God, it's dead orthodoxy.
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:58.420]   It's useless.
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:01.420]   But if you have passion and you don't have the truth,
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:05.420]   you're open to all kinds of heresy that may come in.
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:07.420]   And you're not even able to discern if it is heresy or not
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:09.420]   because you're not studying the Word of God.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:11.420]   So you need both.
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:13.420]   The church is a gathering of people for the purpose
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:14.420]   of worship.
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:15.420]   That's the primary thing he's looking for.
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.420]   The church is a gathering of God's people for the purpose
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:20.420]   of equipping, Ephesians 4, 11 through 16,
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:25.420]   where God gave apostles, prophets.
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:31.420]   What comes after that?
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.420]   I'm going to get it wrong.
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:41.420]   Apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers,
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:44.420]   all for the purpose of what?
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:46.420]   Equipping the saints, right?
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:48.420]   For the purpose of equipping.
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:52.420]   All of them for the purpose of equipping so that we may be
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:55.420]   equipped for the building up of the body of Christ as each one
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.420]   does his own part, right?
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:02.420]   So ultimately so that we may come to the fullness of Christ.
[01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:05.420]   And so the gathering of the church is for the purpose
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:09.420]   of worship and for the purpose of equipping.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.420]   And this is where the equipping is happening.
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:14.420]   And so the purpose of why you're doing Bible study is not to
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:17.420]   scratch your ears and say, "Oh, I know better now," right?
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:19.420]   Because what happens to people who are constantly learning
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:22.420]   and not practicing?
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:25.420]   You become proud, right?
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:29.420]   So knowledge becomes a source to judge other people
[01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:31.420]   if you're not practicing.
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:34.420]   And so it's for the purpose of equipping.
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:36.420]   So everything you're learning today,
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:39.420]   how is this going to equip you to build up the body of Christ,
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:40.420]   right?
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:42.420]   It's for the purpose of equipping.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:44.420]   Five, the church is a gathering of God's people for the purpose
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:47.420]   of fellowship, right?
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:50.420]   In Galatians 6, 1 and 2, it says bear each other's burden and
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:55.420]   those who are more spiritual, right, to confront,
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:59.420]   to care with gentleness that they turn from their sins.
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:05.420]   Hebrews chapter, right, 10, 25, let us not forsake gathering
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:09.420]   together as it is the habit of some but consider how to
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:12.420]   stimulate one another on toward love and good deeds,
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:14.420]   especially as you see the day drawing near.
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:20.420]   So the purpose of the church is so that we may actively seek to
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:23.420]   stimulate and encourage other people, right?
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:28.420]   So if you come to church and the only thought you have is,
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:31.420]   what am I going to get out of it, right?
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:35.420]   You're not -- you're thinking only of yourself, right?
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:39.420]   The purpose of the church is so that those who are strong could
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:42.420]   seek and encourage and turn them away.
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:45.420]   And if you've ever been a part of the church and you're away,
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:50.420]   right, you know physically the difference a good church makes,
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:52.420]   a good fellowship, having brothers and sisters around you,
[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:53.420]   right?
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:55.420]   And that was designed that way.
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:59.420]   God did not design human beings to be alone.
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:02.420]   God did not design Christians to be alone, right?
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:05.420]   He designed our sanctification and worship of God to happen in
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:09.420]   the context of the body of Christ, right?
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:12.420]   And then finally, the church is a gathering of God's people for
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.420]   the purpose of evangelism, right?
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:18.420]   This is something that happens to a church that's been around
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.420]   for a while, and after a while, instead of evangelizing,
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:25.420]   we get so caught up in maintaining that we forget
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:26.420]   evangelism.
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:28.420]   But evangelism is the heartbeat of the church, right?
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:32.420]   Worship and then evangelism, okay?
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:35.420]   So I'm going to give you this, okay?
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:37.420]   We're almost at the end.
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:40.420]   I want you to memorize this, right?
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:44.420]   And I'm going to test you.
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:50.420]   The church is or was, okay, established by Christ for the
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:55.420]   gathering of believers for the purpose of worship, equipping,
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:58.420]   fellowship, and evangelism, okay?
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.420]   So it has all the elements that I just said.
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:08.420]   The church was established by Christ, right, established by
[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:12.420]   Christ for the gathering of believers for the purpose of
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:20.420]   worship, equipping, fellowship, and evangelism, okay?
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:22.420]   Who thinks they can say that?
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:25.420]   Free coffee.
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:32.420]   If you can say this without looking at this, free coffee.
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:33.420]   Nobody?
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:35.420]   You don't want free coffee?
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:36.420]   Gummy bears.
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.420]   Okay, whatever.
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:43.420]   What I'm going to ask you to do is I want you to do your best to
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:46.420]   memorize it, at least get the key elements, those six things.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:50.420]   Church was established by Christ, right?
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:53.420]   Established by Christ for the gathering of believers for the
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:59.420]   purpose of worship, equipping, fellowship, and evangelism.
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.420]   You think you can get that by the time you guys go to your
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:02.420]   small groups?
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:04.420]   Okay?
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:05.420]   One more time, okay?
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:06.420]   Don't look at it.
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:07.420]   Don't look at it, okay?
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:09.420]   Don't cheat.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:14.420]   The church was established by Christ for the gathering of
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:20.420]   believers for the purpose of worship, equipping, fellowship,
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:23.420]   and evangelism, okay?
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:26.420]   I'm going to ask you guys to see if you can do that in your small
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:28.420]   group, okay, afterwards.
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:33.420]   So that's what leads to our fourfold vision at church, okay?
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:36.420]   This is where we get our fourfold vision.
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:39.420]   Engaging in God-centered worship, equipping believers with
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:41.420]   God's word, building Christ-centered community,
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:43.420]   reaching out with the gospel of Christ.
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:46.420]   And let me give you a brief explanation because worship,
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:50.420]   equipping, fellowship, and outreach is all mentioned, but
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:52.420]   they have descriptions.
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:53.420]   It's not just any worship.
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:55.420]   What kind of worship is it?
[01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:57.420]   God-centered worship, right?
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:03.420]   It's not worship if the primary focus is you, right?
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:08.420]   Worship is we see something beyond us, and we give it worth.
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:11.420]   That's where the English word "worship" comes from.
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:12.420]   We are esquipe.
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:15.420]   It means to give worth to something else.
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:18.420]   If you come and you're the primary concern of the church,
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:20.420]   you're the primary concern of why you're gathered, then that's
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:22.420]   not worship, right?
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:25.420]   So that's why we say it's God-centered.
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:26.420]   So it's not just any worship.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:27.420]   It's God-centered worship.
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:30.420]   Two, equipping believers.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:32.420]   A lot of people say, "Well, we're going to equip."
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:34.420]   Equipping with what?
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:36.420]   The Word of God, right?
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:37.420]   We can do training.
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:39.420]   We can do, you know, all kinds of exercises.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.420]   We're going to have, you know, community exercises where we're
[01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:44.420]   going to learn how to, you know, be team building and all this
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:45.420]   stuff.
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:47.420]   And all this stuff you can say, "Oh, we're equipping."
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:50.420]   But the equipping we're talking about is with the Word of God,
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:53.420]   right, specifically with the Word of God.
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:56.420]   Building Christ-centered community.
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:59.420]   Just because the church gathers together and they practice
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:01.420]   community doesn't mean it's a church.
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:03.420]   It must be Christ-centered.
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:06.420]   In other words, it must be Christ-glorifying,
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:10.420]   Christ-imitating, right, Christ-exalting,
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:12.420]   and lead us to the fullness of Christ.
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.420]   So fellowship, just because you gather together and Christians
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.420]   spend time together, that's not fellowship.
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:19.420]   It must be Christ-centered fellowship, okay?
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:21.420]   Finally, reaching out with what?
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:23.420]   The Gospel of Christ.
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:26.420]   Not just reaching out, not just because they're poor,
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:29.420]   not just because there's some, you know, people who are in need,
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:32.420]   but specifically reaching out with the Gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:33.420]   right?
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:34.420]   That's our fourfold vision.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:37.420]   And hopefully if you're members at our church that you can also
[01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:38.420]   memorize this.
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:40.420]   I'm not going to test you today, okay?
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:41.420]   No free drinks or snacks.
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:43.420]   The other one I'm going to ask you to do,
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:46.420]   this one hopefully we say it enough and repeat it enough that
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:49.420]   you can just repeat this to somebody else and explain.
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:52.420]   If somebody asks you, "What is your church about?
[01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:53.420]   What is BCC about?"
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:55.420]   You can explain this, okay?
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:59.420]   None of this is unique to our church.
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:03.420]   This is just a summary of what we see in the Bible.
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:05.420]   Why do we practice membership?
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:08.420]   Worship, equipping, fellowship, evangelism can only be practiced
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:11.420]   with those who are genuine believers.
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:14.420]   We can't practice any of this with non-Christians.
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.420]   They're not able to worship.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:19.420]   How do you equip non-believers when they don't believe in God
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.420]   or the word?
[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:22.420]   How do you have fellowship when fellowship means to partner?
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:24.420]   How do you partner with a non-Christian?
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:26.420]   How do you evangelize when they're the ones we're trying
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:28.420]   to evangelize, right?
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:31.420]   So we practice membership to identify them.
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:33.420]   Early church, the way they had membership,
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:35.420]   that if you were not a baptized believer,
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:39.420]   you weren't allowed to come to worship, right?
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:40.420]   It was exclusive.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:43.420]   That membership happened at the door, right?
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:44.420]   But we don't live in that culture.
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:47.420]   We live in a post-Christian culture where the doors are open,
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:49.420]   where non-Christian can come, where you can invite your family
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:51.420]   and friends, right?
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:55.420]   Because we are doing that, we are allowing the non-Christians
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:57.420]   to--non-members to come to the door,
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:59.420]   we need to be able to identify who's the church.
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:03.420]   And that's the primary reason why we have membership,
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:06.420]   to know who are actually at the church,
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:07.420]   not just who are visiting the church,
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:10.420]   not just who are people who are curious about the church,
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:11.420]   but who is the church.
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:13.420]   That's why we have membership.
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:15.420]   If we open our doors to allow non-believers to be in the
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:17.420]   gathering of the church, we need to be able to identify
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:19.420]   who the genuine believers are, okay?
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:24.420]   So this is the reason why we practice membership.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:29.420]   So just a quick summary of what you read.
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:31.420]   In summary, and I'm not going to go through all that,
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:32.420]   I'm just going to show you the pages because I know you guys
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:34.420]   read through this.
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:37.420]   So at our church, to practice all of this,
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:41.420]   to have God-centered worship, we have to have a high view of God.
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:43.420]   God is not our servant.
[01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:48.420]   He is--we are his servant, right?
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:49.420]   He didn't offend us.
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:50.420]   We offended him.
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:53.420]   He's the one who's gracious to us, not us to him.
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:55.420]   We don't come to church.
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:26:01.420]   Like if God giving you his only begotten son is not enough,
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:04.420]   something's wrong with you, right?
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:07.420]   Like I believe that Jesus gave his only begotten son.
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:08.420]   He died for me.
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:10.420]   And then you're living every day and say, "Yeah,
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:12.420]   but he didn't give me health.
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:14.420]   He didn't give me the job that I wanted.
[01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:15.420]   He didn't give me this.
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:17.420]   He didn't give me that."
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:21.420]   Imagine one day you have a child, right,
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:23.420]   that you've given everything and they say,
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.420]   "But you didn't give me Jamba Juice.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:29.420]   You didn't let me go to Disneyland," right?
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:33.420]   Imagine how that sounds like to God, right?
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:35.420]   He gave us his only begotten son.
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:40.420]   So no matter where you are in life, we owe him our life.
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:44.420]   This is a gathering of people who have been saved from eternal
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:46.420]   damnation through the blood of Christ.
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:49.420]   The son of God gave up his glory for us.
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:52.420]   So no matter where you are in life,
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:57.420]   the church is filled with people who owe him everything, right?
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:02.420]   So it doesn't make sense that we do not have this high view of God.
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:05.420]   And so that's where church begins,
[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:09.420]   a gathering of people who are indebted to what God has done,
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:13.420]   and so we come here to thank him, glorify him, praise him, right?
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:17.420]   So it needs to have a high view of God.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:19.420]   Secondly, we need to have a high view of his word.
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:22.420]   If you have a high view of God, where is that reflected?
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:25.420]   In your high view of his word, right?
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:29.420]   So whatever he says goes.
[01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:31.420]   We don't look at the scripture and say, "You know what?
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:36.420]   I don't know if I like this male leadership."
[01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:38.420]   If you have a high view of God, we listen to him.
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.420]   We don't change him.
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:43.420]   And in time, even if it doesn't make sense to you,
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:48.420]   I guarantee you in time you will understand the wisdom
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:51.420]   behind everything that God does.
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:52.420]   You may not understand it in your teens.
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:54.420]   Maybe some things you might have a hard time understanding
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:58.420]   when you're in your 20s, but I guarantee you every part of this,
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:01.420]   there's going to come a time in your life you're going to look back at that
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:04.420]   and see God's wisdom behind it, right?
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:10.420]   Think how dumb we were just 10 years ago, right?
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:13.420]   I mean, honestly, every single one of us, no matter how old you are,
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:16.420]   think about how you were thinking, what you did 10 years ago,
[01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:18.420]   20 years ago, 30 years ago.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:21.420]   Every single one of us, if we turned the clock back and said,
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:23.420]   "Man, I would have done that different.
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:26.420]   I wish I knew this when I was young," every single one of us,
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:29.420]   you think that's not going to happen in another 10 years and 20 years?
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:32.420]   You think you've come to the peak of knowledge and understanding
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:34.420]   and wisdom, and you know what I mean?
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:39.420]   So from this point on, all your judgment is correct,
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:45.420]   and people who regret just 10, 15 years ago are going to look at an almighty God
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:48.420]   and say, "I don't know about that, God."
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:51.420]   The arrogance, right?
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:54.420]   I mean, we're going to regret just 20 years ago,
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:55.420]   even if nothing ever changes.
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:57.420]   20 years ago, you're going to look back.
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:00.420]   The things that you're thinking because of different perspective
[01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:03.420]   and experience that you're going to have, and you're going to say,
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.420]   "Oh, I was so dumb.
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:05.420]   I should have done this.
[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:07.420]   I should have done that," right?
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:16.420]   So does that make sense for finite, flawed beings, even morally flawed people,
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:21.420]   to look at an almighty, perfect being and then question him, right?
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:25.420]   So if you have a high view of God, you must have a high view of his word.
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:28.420]   And then if you have a high view of his word, the way that gets translated
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:30.420]   is high view of doctrine, right?
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:33.420]   So some people think that if you have a high view of the word of God,
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:34.420]   but doctrine is divisive.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:38.420]   No, doctrine is an accumulation of the word of God, right?
[01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:40.420]   That's why doctrine is important.
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:42.420]   It doesn't mean that every doctrine has the same weight,
[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:45.420]   but doctrine basically is an accumulation of studies.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:47.420]   So the more you study the word of God,
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:51.420]   the more you're going to accumulate certain views of certain things, right?
[01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:53.420]   So we have a high view of doctrine, right?
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:56.420]   Why do we make such a big deal about baptism?
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:30:00.420]   Because we believe in our accumulation of understanding what the word of God says
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:03.420]   that that's what the Bible says.
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:06.420]   So we're trying to practice that, okay?
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:10.420]   So if you have a high view of God, high view of the word, high view of doctrine,
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:14.420]   then there must be a high view of your personal walk with God,
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:17.420]   your personal holiness because you belong to him, right?
[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:19.420]   We're not our own.
[01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:22.420]   So if we're his and we have a high view of God,
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:26.420]   you must have a high view of your own holiness.
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:30.420]   And then finally, spiritual authority, right?
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:32.420]   So you have a -- and I'm going to conclude.
[01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:35.420]   High view of God, high view of his word, high view of doctrine,
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:38.420]   high view of your holiness, right, your personal application,
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:42.420]   and high view of the church, right?
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:45.420]   You must have a high view of the church because this is where he says,
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:48.420]   "Do you not know that you are the temple of God
[01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:52.420]   and the spirit of God dwells in you," plural,
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:54.420]   that this is the temple of God?
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:56.420]   Our gathering is holy, right?
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:59.420]   So therefore, we have to have a high view of his church.
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.420]   So if you're going to have a high view of God, high view of the word,
[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:03.420]   high view of doctrine, high view of our holiness,
[01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:06.420]   and high view of the church,
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:10.420]   how is that the most practically expressed?
[01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:15.420]   We must have the highest view of corporate worship.
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:19.420]   Now, that's not my subject today, so I'm not going to get into that, right?
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:21.420]   All this is interconnected.
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:23.420]   If you're going to have a high view of God,
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:26.420]   you must have a high view of corporate worship.
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:31.420]   We're going to deal with that another time.
[01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:36.420]   So this -- I'm not going to read it, but this basically says the goal --
[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:39.420]   I know there's a lot of things that you may have discussed in this chapter,
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:46.420]   but the goal of the church is not simply to get you to change your behavior, right?
[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:52.420]   It's to get you to think properly and have a proper attitude, right?
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:57.420]   So if you have an attitude of thanksgiving, does that affect the way you serve?
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:58.420]   Yes.
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:01.420]   Does that affect the way you love people?
[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:02.420]   Yes.
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:05.420]   Does that affect the way that you worship God?
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:06.420]   Yes.
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.420]   Does that affect the way you evangelize?
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:09.420]   Yes.
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:16.420]   But if you have somebody where their inner person is bitter, grumpy, angry, judgmental,
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:21.420]   and yet they're high-functioning, they take worship very seriously,
[01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:26.420]   they're always memorizing Scripture, they're doing -- what happens to that person?
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:33.420]   Is God honored, glorified by an individual who's high-functioning but have a bad attitude?
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:38.420]   No, because real worship happens from within, right?
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:39.420]   Real worship happens from within.
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:42.420]   He doesn't want people just to get an A, right?
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:45.420]   Oh, you got all the right answers, right?
[01:32:45.420 --> 01:32:48.420]   He wants a church to worship him in spirit and in truth.
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:55.420]   So the primary goal of the church is so that your inner being would become more
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:33:02.420]   and more of somebody that can worship, that can serve, that can evangelize, right?
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:08.420]   So the focus of sanctification is who you are before what you do.
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:13.420]   And that's why the key is the teaching of the Word of God, right?
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:18.420]   Everybody could be very high-functioning, serving everywhere, memorizing Scripture,
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:23.420]   doing all their Bible study, but inwardly they're grumbling, complaining,
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:25.420]   pointing fingers at everybody.
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:28.420]   God is not honored by that, right?
[01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:30.420]   He wants to see the fruit of the Spirit.
[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:34.420]   The fruit of the Spirit is what leads to evangelism, what leads to worship,
[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:39.420]   what leads to love and grace, okay?
[01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.420]   Okay.
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:41.420]   Now we're at the end.
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:42.420]   Okay.
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:43.420]   So we have four questions.
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:45.420]   What is the primary purpose of the church?
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:50.420]   Try to recite the definition of the church by memory, which is homework for you tonight, okay?
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:52.420]   So I'm going to test you next week.
[01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:55.420]   Number two, what does it mean practically to have a high view of God,
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.420]   His Word, and His church, right?
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:00.420]   We say you have the high view, but what does that mean practically in application?
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:06.420]   Think of at least three examples of how these things should impact the way we practice our Christian lives, okay?
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:08.420]   This is practical application.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:13.420]   Why do you think practicing membership is important for the health of the church?
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:18.420]   What are some ramifications of a church that has low expectations of their members?
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:25.420]   Or think of one practical application on how you can be a better member of Christ's church this coming week, okay?
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:33.420]   Would you pray for us, and then I'll give you time to discuss these questions.
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:38.420]   Father, we pray that the truths of Your Word would impact our hearts,
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:43.420]   and as You told us, Lord God, that You are seeking people to worship You in spirit and in truth,
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:51.420]   help us, Lord, to understand Your purpose in the church and why You have made a covenant with it,
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:56.420]   and that we would have a deeper understanding of why we are gathered and what it is exactly that we are building.
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:35:00.420]   So I pray that You would bless a time of discussion, help us to be open and honest,
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:04.420]   and that we would be able to practically apply all that You teach us.
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:06.420]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:20.420]   [silence]
