[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews 11.7, we're going to be looking at Noah, the
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.760]   third person on this list of heroes of faith.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.760]   Hebrews 11.7.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.240]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.840]   By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.440]   for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world and became an heir
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.120]   of the righteousness which is according to faith.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.720]   Let's pray.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.760]   Father, I praise you.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.720]   We need you.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.120]   Lord, we plead with you.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.600]   May your word have its intended effects in our hearts.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.280]   I pray, Lord God, that you would soften hearts that have become callous.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.160]   If we have drifted, call us back that we may be anchored, that we may live lives truly
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.920]   worthy of the gospel that we proclaim to believe.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.000]   I pray that these truths would not fall on deaf ears.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   May your word and your word alone go forth and accomplish its purpose.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Amen.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.200]   Alright, so when we think about the story of Noah, if you can put up the first, okay,
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.160]   I don't know if you guys can see it, that's a typical picture that we remember when we
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.800]   think of Noah, right?
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.520]   You have these cute animals who are sitting on this large boat two by two, right?
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.760]   And so if you grew up in the church, you're very familiar with this picture, you know.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.240]   But this is not an accurate depiction of what we see in Genesis.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.840]   If you go to the next picture, and that's obviously a rendition of a tsunami that's
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.760]   coming and wiping away a small town.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.880]   The story of Noah is really the devastation of mankind, that God's judgment.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.120]   It really is a foreshadowing of what God says is going to happen to mankind.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:25.240]   And he preserved only eight people, 1500 years have passed since Adam, and during those 1500
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.040]   years, all those hundreds of thousands of people that must have been born during that
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.160]   period and only eight people survived this judgment.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.600]   So the story of Noah is a depiction of the judgment that is coming.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.720]   It serves as a warning to mankind to take God's word seriously.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.480]   It also is a picture of how God will save mankind.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.800]   So I think we need to be careful when we teach our children that we don't simply sanitize
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.520]   what this story really is about.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.360]   Because when I was younger, and I'm not saying that we can't ever use those pictures, but
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.320]   when I was younger, before I became a Christian, when I thought of Noah, I've had that in my
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   mind.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.380]   It's a cute picture of animals coming together and riding a boat, going to the zoo.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.040]   And I remember once reading what the story was about, it's like, wow, this is the story
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.040]   of the judgment of God.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.360]   And we would never picture the book of Revelation in that way.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.640]   In fact, if you look at it, the animals coming to the ark is a very small portion of what
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   happens.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.480]   The majority of it is God warning year after year after year.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.960]   And in obedience, God leaves a witness.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.280]   And in the end, just as God says, devastation comes.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.760]   You know, if you look at Genesis, Noah is introduced to us in chapter 5, just in genealogy.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.040]   And then chapter 6, 7, 8, and 9, and then 10 is about Noah's life.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.200]   So we have about six chapters in the book of Genesis about Noah and his descendants.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.080]   The only other person on this list that gets that kind of attention is Abraham.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.440]   And yet, in this text, we only have one verse.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.120]   So it's not that his life isn't significant, but that every part of what he says in verse
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.980]   7 is hugely significant.
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.400]   Because God uses Noah repeatedly in the Old Testament and the New Testament as an example
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.520]   of the judgment to come.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.320]   We need to take heed as we study Noah's life.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:49.240]   And we need to ask ourselves if Noah, what happened to Noah, serves to remind the world
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.940]   that judgment is coming.
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:00.620]   And then to live the rest of our lives with this sanitized version where we're trying
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.320]   to make a better life, we're trying to have an easier life, a healthier life, a long and
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.840]   prosperous life, the whole time professing mankind is going to be wiped out.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.800]   Maybe not through a flood, as God said that he was not going to do it in that way, but
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.000]   if you read the book of Revelation, it's pretty clear.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.880]   The devastation that's coming at the end of human history is going to be much like the flood.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.220]   In fact, greater than the flood.
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.320]   Because it's going to be an eternal judgment.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.560]   What is it that we are to learn from this text?
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.880]   So I divide it into three things that I think we really need to pay attention to.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.480]   First is that through Noah, God warns the world to turn from their sins.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.280]   And that really is the core of the gospel message.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.120]   It's not simply that there is a superpower being who created the universe who loves you
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.120]   unconditionally.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.920]   Why don't you give him a try?
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   Open your heart and let him in.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.560]   And God will take care of your life.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.240]   That is not the gospel message.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.360]   The gospel message begins by saying God is actually angry with this world.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   He is so angry.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.560]   He was so grieved by what he saw.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.640]   He told Noah that they are all going to be gone.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.040]   Not just a few select, not just people here and there.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.760]   He said all of it.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.880]   In Genesis 6, God looked on the earth and behold it was corrupt.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.560]   For all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.120]   And God said to Noah, the end of all flesh has come before me.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.560]   End of all flesh.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.000]   And when he says all flesh, he meant all flesh.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   All of mankind.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.080]   I mean, look at the whole world that has been locked down.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.560]   Because we are afraid that we are going to get this virus and a few of us might die.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.400]   Point two percent might die if we get this.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.920]   And so in fear, the whole economy has been shut down.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.720]   People can't travel.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.480]   Schools have been shut down.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.840]   But God says to Noah, all flesh, all flesh, a hundred percent of the flesh has fallen
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.680]   short.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.400]   For the earth is filled with violence because of them.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.440]   And behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.320]   Now we would love to sanitize this and say, well, you know, God was done with that in
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.680]   the book of Genesis.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:42.480]   He started, he may have started out with that, but surely that's not who he is now.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.600]   I think you and I know better.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.280]   This warning is throughout human history.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.360]   In fact, it escalates because he said the wrath of God is being stored up.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.760]   It's being stored up.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:03.160]   If God was so grieved with 1500 years of men rebelling and sinning against God, how about
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.780]   tens of thousands of years?
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:11.520]   If he was angry with a few hundred thousand people, how about billions and billions of
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.960]   people rebelling against God?
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:20.000]   So when he says the anger of God is being stored up and we see a glimpse of a tiny glimpse
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.120]   of that in the book of Revelation, what would the wrath of God look like then?
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.960]   In Amos chapter 3, 7, it says, surely the Lord God does nothing unless he reveals his
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:35.160]   secret counsel to his servant, the prophets.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:43.000]   God uses Noah, the prophets, the scriptures, the church, the apostles, missionaries, pastors,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.120]   lay people.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:52.040]   Each one of us has been called what he revealed to us to tell the nations.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.980]   He says surely the Lord God does nothing unless he reveals his secret counsel to his servants,
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.980]   the prophets.
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:03.000]   That's exactly what it says in Hebrews 11, 7, by faith Noah, being warned by God about
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.760]   things not yet seen.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.920]   God warned Noah first.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:14.560]   Remember last week we talked about how Enoch was established and he was caught up in Jude
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.040]   14 and 15.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.400]   He was the first evangelist who warned about the judgment to come.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.160]   What's interesting is Enoch has a child before he is taken up.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.200]   His name is Methuselah and his claim to fame in the Bible is that he lived the longest
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.360]   of all human beings recorded in Genesis.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.320]   He lived 969 years.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.640]   But the significance of Methuselah is not the length of his life.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.920]   His name literally means in Hebrew, "when he is dead it shall be sent."
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.600]   Now you know that God does nothing by accident.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.720]   That even the names of the prophets, even the names of the patriarchs have significance
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.880]   because God embedded in their name what he planned to do in the future.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.300]   Methuselah's name is "when he dies it shall be sent."
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:11.600]   If you look at the chart of their life, we know exactly what he was talking about because
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:18.200]   Enoch dies, Methuselah is born, when Methuselah dies, what happens?
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.600]   The flood comes.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.440]   Flood comes.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.840]   So God did not all of a sudden sprung it up on mankind and say, "I'm done and then you
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.840]   guys are finished."
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.840]   He's been telling Enoch, he's been telling Noah, he prophesied within Methuselah's very
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:40.480]   life, warning the nations to turn.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:47.560]   God has implanted all throughout history, every part of scripture, warning about the
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.800]   judgment to come.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.360]   The church has sanitized the gospel because it is not palatable to the world.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.400]   They will not come to church if we emphasize this aspect.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.280]   That's why hell slowly has fallen off the pulpit.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.720]   I want to talk about being encouraging.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.380]   Life is hard enough as it is.
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:14.520]   We have pastors who just outright say, "I'm not going to preach about sin because it ruins
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.560]   people's days."
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.000]   So they have not rejected it and said, "It's not because I don't believe in sin, it's because
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.920]   if we talk too much about it, people are going to be discouraged and they're not going to
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.120]   come to church."
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.040]   By all practical purposes, it's been weeded out of the church.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:38.320]   And yet, the central message of the gospel is a warning about the judgment to come.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.120]   There's a reason why Noah's story is six chapters in the book of Genesis.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.680]   He didn't just pick out a few people here and there.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.240]   He was so angered, he wiped out the earth.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:58.660]   Isaiah 13, 9, "Behold, the day of the Lord is coming, cruel, with fury and burning anger,
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:04.360]   to make the land a desolation, and he will exterminate the sinners from it."
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.680]   The way that we understand God, Isaiah 13, 9, doesn't make any sense.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.800]   Why would a loving God do this?
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:18.000]   And that's a common question that Christians in this generation, even Christians in the
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.480]   church in this generation, ask that question.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.840]   Why would a loving God do this?
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.520]   It's because they've forgotten about Noah.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.240]   Because we made the story about Noah, about two animals going home and resting and having
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.840]   fun.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.720]   He actually did it already.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.600]   In 2 Peter 3, 10, "But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.200]   will pass away with a roar, and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.480]   earth and its works will be burned up."
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.360]   All that you and I treasure.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:03.200]   This means that every beautiful place that we visited, everything that the world says
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.200]   is magnificent.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.600]   He says the earth is going to be burned up.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.120]   It's all going to be destroyed.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.800]   And he warns the church not to be caught off guard, as if a thief is coming.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.840]   In other words, pay attention to his word.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.840]   Remember what he says.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:29.120]   Revelation 9, 18 and 19, "A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues."
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.200]   He's only talking about one event.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.280]   If you've ever read the book of Revelation, 70% of what he says is about the judgment
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   that's to come.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.840]   And in one verse he says, "These three plagues killed a third of mankind by the fire and
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.800]   the smoke and the brimstone which proceeded out of their mouths.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.640]   For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for the tails are like
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.920]   serpents and have heads, and with them they do harm."
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:02.920]   Today if you preach from this text, immediately you get the label, "Oh, he's a fire and brimstone
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.280]   preacher."
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.480]   Which means, I'm not going to go to a church of fire and brimstone.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.480]   That's an ancient thing.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.160]   That's what they did, you know, a hundred years ago.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.520]   No one's going to sit through that.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.320]   And they're absolutely correct.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.400]   Because we have a generation of people who think fire and brimstone is not biblical.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.800]   That is not the God that they serve.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.960]   And they are absolutely correct.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:31.040]   We have a generation filled with people just quoting scripture, they get offended.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.480]   And yet the Bible tells us not to ignore.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.600]   As much as we love to hang verses and memorize scripture and put it on our t-shirts and tell
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.960]   it to our children about the grace of God, the faithfulness of God, of the mercy of God,
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.440]   the Bible is filled with warnings of Noah.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.080]   That this judgment is real.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:57.600]   That when the end comes, when the white throne judgment comes, what comes after that, there
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   is no mercy.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.600]   Up to that point, God is being patient.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.960]   He's being faithful.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.040]   He's waiting patiently.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.080]   But after the white throne judgment, what happens in the day of Noah is going to seem
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.080]   merciful.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.040]   And it is not one verse.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.240]   It is not one event.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:21.640]   All throughout scripture, mankind is warned that this will come.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:29.480]   Romans 118, "For the wrath of God is revealed, is even now being revealed from heaven against
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:36.320]   all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:42.000]   If you go on and share the gospel to the unbelieving world, one of the most common questions you
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.720]   get is, "How can a God that you say is loving allow 9/11 to happen?
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.600]   How can a God who is so loving and gracious and who loves us so much, why does he allow
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.200]   sex trafficking to happen?
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.240]   Why does he allow poverty to happen?
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.680]   Why do they allow injustice to happen if your God is so good?"
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:07.800]   Part of the reason why is because we preach the wrong gospel.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.920]   We sanitize the gospel where they don't understand that God is angry with this world.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:20.760]   That in our natural state, if we die, we are not going to meet a gracious and loving God.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:27.320]   We are going to meet the God of Noah where he was so grieved and angered that he said,
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.400]   "Enough!"
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.080]   And he wiped out the earth.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.960]   That's the God that a man and a woman who is not covered by the blood of Christ will
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.560]   meet on the judgment day.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.000]   And the Bible tells us that the wrath of God is being revealed.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:54.240]   So whenever you see disaster happening because of the sinfulness of mankind, it is a glimpse
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.920]   of what will come in the future.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.660]   In fact, the question really is, the only reason why we don't see more of it is because
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.560]   of common grace.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.400]   It is because he left the church as a witness.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:16.280]   It is because he left the church to sanctify and to be the light.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:21.400]   But one day that light and the darkness is going to be separated for eternity.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:28.720]   And the Bible tells us that you and I are here just as Noah was given this message to
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   share.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.720]   Hebrews 11, 7 says, "By which he condemned the world."
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.280]   Genesis 6 says, "The Lord was sorry that he had made man on earth."
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.120]   In the NIV it says, "He grieved."
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.040]   And that's exactly the meaning behind this.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:53.360]   That God was so disturbed by the sins of mankind that he said, "Enough!"
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:18:02.600]   Imagine if God had enough 1500 years, what his wrath would look like after all these
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.040]   years of being stored up.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.000]   All these years of violence.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.800]   All these years of blasphemy.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.560]   All these years of murder.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:17.240]   All these years of sexual immorality that has been stored up.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:22.840]   In Ephesians 4, verse 30 says, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God."
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.560]   Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:30.600]   Imagine God was grieved because of sin of mankind and he wiped them out.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:36.080]   Ephesians 4, verse 30 when it says, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God."
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.080]   Imagine.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.080]   Imagine.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   Not realizing how much God hates sin.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:48.560]   He hates sin so much that he was willing to start all over.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:55.600]   So when he says, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit," he's talking about an almighty God who by
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.520]   the snap of his finger can wipe out the earth with a flood, with fire, with plague.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.680]   He said, "Do not poke this God.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.760]   Do not take lightly who he is."
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.000]   That's what it means, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit."
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.840]   It's not saying, "Do not make him sad."
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.920]   It's not saying, "Don't get on the wrong side."
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:25.840]   To grieve the Holy Spirit is to stir up anger and wrath.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:30.600]   If that's what he says, Genesis 6, "And the Lord said, 'I will blot out man whom I have
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.400]   created from the face of the land, from man to animals, to creeping things, and all the
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.560]   birds of the sky.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.960]   For I am sorry, I am grieved that I made them.'"
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.960]   Romans 2, 4-5.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.360]   "Or do you think lightly of the riches of his kindness and tolerance and patience, not
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:55.000]   knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?"
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.400]   Whole reason why we even repent is because God was merciful.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.520]   It wasn't our doing.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:06.040]   He said, "Do you take lightly the grace of God, not knowing that God saved us from this
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.040]   wrath?"
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.520]   And then in verse 5, "But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:15.280]   are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath."
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:21.200]   After hearing the gospel, after being enlightened, after being around the fellowship of the Holy
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:28.720]   Spirit, after being in the church, given the word of God, and after all of that, you simply
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:37.840]   drift along into the world, denying the Savior by our life, loving him with our lips.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.400]   Do you not know?
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.080]   That repentance is God's kindness.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   If observing mankind stirred him up that much, how much more if we are storing up this wrath
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.080]   for ourselves?
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:59.640]   Matthew 24, 37-39, "For the coming of the Son of Man will be like the days of Noah.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.160]   For as in those days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.640]   in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark."
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.400]   You notice here, he doesn't talk about pornography.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.240]   He doesn't talk about murder.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.880]   He doesn't talk about poverty or injustice.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:20.440]   He just says they were just marrying, giving in marriage, drinking, eating, just like everybody
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.040]   else does in this world.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.840]   Yet in all of that, they were living in rebellion against God.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:32.120]   Because they refused to acknowledge God.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.880]   And they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.160]   So will the coming of the Son of Man be.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:46.640]   So the storing of the wrath isn't just murdering and killing.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.400]   Just living a life where God is not honored.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.280]   And living a life away from the purpose of God.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.800]   Just living our lives like everybody else in this world.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.880]   Raise good children.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.160]   Often go to church.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.520]   Pay your tithe.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.840]   Do your part.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:12.040]   Being religious, yet having our hearts far from Him.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.600]   See, God left a witness.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.520]   Enoch, Methuselah, and Noah.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.600]   Secondly, God gave opportunities for people to repent.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:32.160]   Not only is Noah's ark serves as a warning to mankind, it's actually an opportunity where
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.480]   God is being patient and calling us to repentance.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:43.120]   120 years, Noah built this ark.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.080]   In the middle of nowhere.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.320]   Literally middle of nowhere.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.560]   And you know what it says in Hebrews 11.7, it says, "In reverence," when he heard the
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   warning was coming that isn't there yet, "in reverence he prepared an ark."
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.440]   So why did he build an ark?
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.400]   They don't elaborate.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:08.800]   And in the short statement, basically it says, "because he believed."
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.720]   God said judgment is coming, the world is going to be wiped out, and because he believed
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.440]   he says he feared.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:19.740]   The word reverence in some of your translations, it says he feared.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:24.760]   For whatever the reason, we think fearing God is not biblical.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.760]   That's not Christianity.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.480]   I'm going to quote Kanye West this morning.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:37.680]   He was being interviewed and asked, "What happened to you?"
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.240]   Now whether you believe his faith is genuine or not, but at least this statement I can't
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.600]   deny.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.260]   And he said, "I fear God.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.880]   And because I fear God, I don't fear anything else."
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:57.520]   Don't you fear your peers and other people in the entertainment industry?
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.480]   The politicians that you're being called this and you're being called that?
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.640]   Do you not know the consequence of having that political thing and being religious?
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.320]   And he says, "I fear God.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.480]   And because I fear God, I fear nothing else."
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.520]   Noah heard the warning and he said because he believed, he feared God.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.420]   In other words, he took it serious.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.680]   He took his warning, he took it serious, and that's why he started building this ark.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:32.680]   This ark was 500 feet long, 85 feet wide, 50 feet high.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.720]   Five story building, even though it had three levels.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.960]   People often say, "Oh, could they have fit all the animals?"
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.440]   In fact, they actually did a study in 2014.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.360]   There's 34,000 known species that are living in there.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:52.800]   In 2014, they said over 90% of the animals that we know of are smaller than cats.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.760]   So, it's just even scientifically, if you were to say, "Was that boat big enough?"
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.080]   He said, "By far."
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.240]   But that's not the point of the story.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:09.080]   Because God left that to us as a witness.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:15.240]   What do you think that Noah did for 120 years while he was building this?
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.760]   Why did he even build a boat?
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:23.720]   Why this drama of rain and flood for 40 days and 40 nights?
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.400]   I mean, he wanted to save Enoch.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.920]   What did he do?
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.260]   Come up!
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.280]   Why did he do that with the aid and then just destroy them?
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:38.840]   What was the drama of 120 years of building this ridiculous square box in the middle of
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:45.520]   the desert, while for 120 years, enduring the mocking, probably, of all their neighbors?
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.520]   Look at that crazy man.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.880]   And this is before power tools.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.440]   This is before Home Depot, where you can go and get nicely cut wood.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.480]   You have to cut down trees, and you have to get it all handmade.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.760]   That's why it took 120 years.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.760]   For what purpose?
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:08.680]   You know, it's interesting that the ark is just a rectangular box.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.840]   It's almost like it wasn't meant to go anywhere.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.580]   It was just meant to float.
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.160]   And God did it on purpose, to leave a witness.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.080]   What do you think he did for 120 years, when people asked him, "Why are you building that
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.080]   boat?"
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.000]   God left a witness.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:33.360]   For 120 years, every time they asked him, "Hey, God said you're going to be judged.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.560]   God said you're going to be judged if you do not repent."
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:48.080]   So the 120 years of his labor was a physical and verbal witness of God pleading with mankind
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.080]   to repent.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:59.080]   Genesis 6.22, "Thus Noah did according to all that God had commanded him, so he did."
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.640]   I mean, it's so simple.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:10.000]   He believed, so he did it.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.420]   We've made Christianity so complicated today.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.800]   It's almost like if you convert and become a Christian, you have to go to seminary to
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.920]   even understand what you're supposed to believe or not believe.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.980]   It's simple.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.360]   If you believe Jesus, you follow Jesus.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.700]   And you want to know what he has to say, read the Bible.
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.720]   You want to know him, go and pray.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:42.560]   We have books, seminaries, conferences, discipleship, programs, training.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.040]   I'm not saying any of that stuff is bad.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.880]   But if you say you're a follower of Jesus Christ, you have to follow Jesus Christ.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.700]   If you say you believe in Jesus Christ, you actually have to believe in Jesus Christ.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:58.600]   You can't say you believe that he's the way and then not go.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.520]   You can't say that, "I believe the warning is coming.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.760]   I believe the judgment is coming.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.300]   I believe the world is going to be wiped out."
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:11.400]   And then live the rest of your life like everybody else in this world.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.520]   That's not Christianity 401.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.940]   That's just basic common sense.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:26.720]   But if you believe in the message that the Bible teaches, either you believe it and you
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.840]   follow him or you don't believe it and don't follow him.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:37.480]   But you can't say, "I believe" and then not follow him.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:46.120]   It simply says, "He believed, he feared, and he did it."
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.000]   All of this to leave a witness.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.400]   First Peter 3, 20-22, "Who once were disobedient when the patience of God kept waiting in the
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.440]   days of Noah."
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.120]   He kept waiting in the days of Noah, telling them to repent.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.200]   "During the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is eight persons, were brought
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.600]   safely through the water, corresponding to that baptism now saves you."
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.480]   Not only did he leave a witness to them, he left a witness to us of what God was going
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.480]   to do.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:19.600]   That through his death and resurrection in our baptism, he said he was going to save
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.120]   us as well.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:27.080]   Just like he condemned the world for rejecting him, he will condemn the world and those who
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:32.840]   believe and are saved through the water, just like Noah, we will be saved.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.280]   Not the removal of the dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.760]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is at the right hand of God, having gone
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:45.080]   into heaven after angels and authorities and powers and had been subjected to him.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:49.880]   Can you put up the next slide?
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:56.520]   Yes, I know the room is filled with Chinese Americans, but I'm going to teach you some
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.280]   Chinese today.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.480]   That's the word for boat, chuan.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:08.400]   I almost corrected.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.320]   It's not chuan, it's chuan.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.040]   And I know somebody is going to correct me too after that.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.120]   That's the word for boat in the Chinese character.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.040]   And as you guys know, the Chinese character basically at one point were pictures that
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.360]   were made into characters, and you could see the meaning of the word.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:32.000]   You know, like we look at English words and we do the history of that word and where it
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.040]   came from, so it either came from Greek or Latin or something, and that's how we dissect
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.080]   the word and say, "Hey, this is what this word means."
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.400]   With Chinese characters, it's embedded into their character.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.840]   Well mainland China has been using the simplified version, but those of you who are Taiwanese,
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.740]   they still use that old, regular Chinese.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.720]   And this Chinese word for boat are three words, three pictures put together.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.240]   The vessel, number eight, and people.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.240]   If you've ever studied Chinese, there's so many words like this.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:11.280]   In fact, when I took Chinese class, one of the words that really intrigued me was the
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.440]   number six.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.720]   So the teacher who was teaching this, she studied Chinese character history, and she
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.540]   was not a Christian.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:26.800]   So she was telling us about the character, and she said, "The number for, or the character
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.440]   for man is the number six."
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.640]   I said, "That's interesting."
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:35.720]   So I went up to her and I said, "Why is the number for man six?"
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.720]   She said, "I don't know."
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.600]   So I said, "I know."
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.120]   So I opened up the Bible and I showed it to her.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.840]   The Bible said the number of man is six.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.440]   And she said, "Oh, that's interesting."
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:51.120]   I mean, there's all kinds of, you can go to a website that has a bunch of this stuff.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:57.080]   Character for righteousness is a character of a lamb over an altar.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.080]   And I asked her that.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.120]   It's like, "Why is this character for righteousness?
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:06.080]   Why is a lamb being offered up over an altar the word for righteousness?"
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.080]   She's like, "I don't know."
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.040]   I said, "Well, this is what the Bible says."
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.360]   So I got to share the gospel with her through these Chinese characters.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   It was interesting.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.000]   So, "I don't know."
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.040]   We could just say it's embedded into the culture.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.040]   It's an ancient culture.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.720]   Obviously, the Chinese culture, they've used this language for thousands of years.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.280]   And I don't know how it came in.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.560]   That's why I always, you know, I'm very skeptical.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   So I thought maybe the missionaries.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.600]   I said, "They didn't have boats before missionaries?"
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.200]   So it didn't make sense, but, you know, I'm skeptical.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.800]   But the number six?
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.880]   They must have had that from the very beginning.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.880]   Why would that be man?
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.160]   I have my conclusion.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:56.640]   But whether you believe this or not, God has left imprints of himself if you are interested.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.160]   That's why he calls people to himself.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.240]   He said he left evidence of himself in all of creation.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.080]   He sent prophets.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:09.600]   He gave us the word of God, the Holy Spirit, all of it, so that if we are interested, if
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.000]   we humble ourselves and seek him out, he left imprints.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.400]   The problem is, the Bible says we suppress the truth because we're afraid if we find
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.240]   the truth that all the other things that he said is true.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.920]   A judgment is coming.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.120]   That he said you have to pick up the cross as well.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.480]   You have to lose your life as well.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:37.160]   So if this is true, I don't want this to be true, so neither do I want this to be true.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.160]   And so I suppress the truth.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.700]   Because I don't want to receive the consequence of what this means.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:50.420]   And so we embrace cultural Christianity.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:56.920]   Cultural Christianity is simply jumping through the hoops to appease what is expected of whatever
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:02.840]   church or fellowship that you belong to.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:13.920]   And following Christ, following Christ requires us to focus our eyes upon Christ.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:20.240]   And true unity in the church is unity that happens as a result of men and women who are
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.800]   sold out for Jesus Christ.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.720]   Even if we look different, even if we speak different languages, even if it takes us to
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.480]   different parts of the world.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:42.080]   See God through Noah warned them for 120 years that they would return, but they would not.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:48.120]   Third and finally, by faith God made Noah an heir of righteousness.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.240]   Genesis 6, 8, "But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord."
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.120]   And he explains it in this text.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.000]   Noah became an heir of righteousness according to faith.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:05.320]   You know whenever we study Hebrews chapter 11, we have two ways that we get imbalanced.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:11.660]   So the first group of people will look at Hebrews and look at all these achievements.
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.600]   By faith look what they did.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.540]   He gave up everything, he built the ark, Abraham walked down to the desert.
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.200]   Some people lived, some people died.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.200]   Look what they did.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:27.200]   And so some people will read this chapter 11 to challenge whoever that they are challenging.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:32.760]   Look, we're supposed to do, we're supposed to give our life.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:38.540]   And then other people will read this text and say, no it's by faith.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.680]   Everyone starts by faith, by faith, by faith.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.440]   It's not about what they did, it's about faith.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:52.160]   So stop talking about what we should do and just talk about what he did.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:57.600]   Either extreme is not biblical because the point that he's trying to make is because
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:05.640]   he believed he did this, the evidence of genuine faith is that they obeyed.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:12.600]   His salvation didn't come because he worked, he worked because he believed.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:19.040]   You can't profess faith and then just go home.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.440]   You can't just profess faith and become a member of the church and then just go home
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.520]   and live like everybody else.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.880]   It's not one or the other.
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.920]   That's the point that he's trying to make.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.480]   If you profess and there's no evidence of that, it may not be genuine faith.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:40.200]   And if you think that you're going to somehow gain righteousness by doing all of this stuff
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:45.960]   and yet thinking that somehow you can earn your righteousness, it's completely unbiblical.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:51.360]   He's saying, Noah did all of this because he believed and he became an heir.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.880]   You know what heir means?
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.240]   Heir means it belonged to somebody else.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.160]   It belonged to somebody else and when that person dies, you get it free.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   You didn't earn that.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.160]   That's what he means.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.160]   He became an heir of righteousness.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.680]   He received something that he did not earn.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.680]   That's what he means by this.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.200]   By faith, he became an heir of righteousness.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.880]   But his faith caused him to build that ark and be a witness for 120 years, telling people
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:23.800]   about the judgment to come.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   What's interesting here is out of all those people, now we have no idea how many people
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:33.000]   were there, minimum thousands, hundreds of thousands possibly for 1500 years.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.440]   And remember, each one of these guys lived hundreds and hundreds of years.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:44.680]   Meaning they could have had hundreds of kids.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:49.280]   We don't know that for sure, but just how human beings work.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:55.320]   Out of all those people, eight people got saved.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.520]   Eight.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:02.080]   That's a pattern that we see all throughout scripture.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.600]   Remnant, remnant.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:10.000]   Isaiah 10.21, "A remnant will return, a remnant of Jacob, the mighty God."
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   A small number.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.360]   That's what he's saying, small number.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:20.000]   Romans 11.5, "In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.160]   remnant according to God's gracious choice."
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.160]   A small number.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.360]   That's what a remnant is.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.800]   Romans 9.27, "Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, 'Though the number of the sons of
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:35.440]   Israel be like the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that will be saved.'"
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.720]   A remnant, a small number.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.720]   Do you know why this is so important?
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:45.200]   It's because you and I are social creatures.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:50.020]   So we don't like to be the first ones to do anything.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:54.320]   We usually wait until we see if it's acceptable to the community that we belong to before
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.320]   we move.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.200]   Even when we are being stirred.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:03.160]   We will wait until the masses come together, then we can speak out, then we can walk, then
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.000]   we can go that direction.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.320]   Because that's our tendency.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:11.320]   But here's the problem.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:16.920]   Just as he saved the eight among the multitudes, the Bible says that he will do the same at
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   the end.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:24.280]   In Matthew 7.13-14, "Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.480]   broad that leads to destruction."
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:35.200]   And there are many who enter through it.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.240]   You know he's talking about the church.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:44.060]   You know he's talking about the church.
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.880]   Cultural Christianity isn't a lesser Christianity.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:52.240]   It's not Christianity.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:58.240]   And it is so powerful that we can live all our lives jumping through hoops to belong
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:05.560]   to whatever church that you belong to, and yet you never truly followed Christ.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:08.920]   That's how much power community has.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:15.680]   You know, when we're young, part of the reason why children are cute is because they don't
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.720]   think too much about what other people are going to think.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.080]   So they do crazy things.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.640]   They're inhibited, uninhibited.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.640]   So they'll walk around naked.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.360]   I mean, they don't realize it yet.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.840]   As soon as they hit puberty, all of a sudden, you know, they're very aware, in fact, hyper
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.200]   aware of their friends.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.640]   They'll cut their hair a certain way, wear tight skinny jeans.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:42.400]   You have to have a certain kind of sunglasses, you have to wear certain brand of shoes, because
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.640]   they're hyper aware all of a sudden.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.800]   But you know that peer pressure never goes away.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.400]   It never goes away.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.800]   It's just your community changes.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:59.960]   So in your 20s, you know, you have a certain way because that's what your friends do.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:04.200]   You do certain things, you get certain jobs, you buy certain houses, you buy certain cars,
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.680]   all because of this is what's acceptable.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   That doesn't change.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.320]   You get married and have kids.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.320]   What do other kids have?
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.880]   How come the other parents are doing this, and they have this many children, and they
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.880]   have, what do they do?
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.880]   What school did they go to?
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.400]   What kind of jobs do they have?
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.960]   That peer pressure never changes.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:24.320]   That goes to grandkids.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:29.240]   I spent a lot of time with seniors when I was teaching ESL.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.400]   It's no different with them either.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.600]   You would think that at the age of 70 and 80, you know, they're just kind of coasting
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.600]   along.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.400]   No, they're just older teenagers.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.320]   They have the same problems, comparing.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.920]   Lot of the comparing they do is, what did their kids give you?
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:53.080]   So they compare the success of their children with other grandparents.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.640]   That pressure never goes away.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:04.720]   And so we rise to the expectation of the community that we belong to, but we never break out.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.200]   We never break out.
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:14.320]   See, cultural Christianity can be easily explained by psychologists and sociologists.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:19.160]   Religious people go to church because they need to be comforted.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.800]   They want their children to be taught morals.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.600]   They go to church because they need community.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.320]   Because we live in a society where there isn't any community, so a lot of people go to church.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:38.800]   So if you happen to run into a non-Christian who is perfectly happy with their family,
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:43.320]   they have community with whatever it is that they have.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.120]   And they feel secure, and they're not worried about death.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:53.440]   I don't need it, because what they are observing is cultural Christianity.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.000]   And so they'll say, "I don't need the gospel," because they think that's what Christianity
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.800]   is.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:04.600]   But the message of the cross and the life that he calls us to makes no sense psychologically
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.840]   and sociologically.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:16.520]   Jesus took rich fishermen and told them to follow him, and they gave their lives, professing
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:21.080]   that their Savior was resurrected from the dead.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:26.320]   Apostle Paul, who already was in the top of the world as a Jew, said, "No, now you will
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.360]   suffer many things for my name's sake."
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.360]   Why would he do that?
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.360]   He already told him, "You're living a nice, comfortable life now, and from the get-go,
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.840]   God said, 'I've called you to the Gentiles, and I will show you how much you will suffer
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.000]   for my name's sake.'"
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.400]   He told him he was going to suffer for his name's sake.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.760]   Why did Paul do that?
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.340]   Because he believed.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.040]   Because he believed.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:53.000]   The biblical Christianity that Jesus calls us to, there is no psychological, sociological
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.200]   answer unless you actually believe that judgment is coming.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.880]   Why would you forsake your comfort?
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.840]   Why would you forsake your careers?
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.960]   Why would you risk the future of your children?
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.480]   See this secular, materialistic world, it makes no sense.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.040]   Biblical Christianity makes no sense.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:24.360]   Either you are crazy, or you actually believe what you profess to believe.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.680]   There is nothing in the middle.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:31.340]   Because everything in the middle is just cultural sociology.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:34.720]   You just happen to have a lot of Christian friends.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.920]   You just happen to be raised in a Christian home.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.920]   Your parents, your grandparents, your great-grandparents happen to be Christians, so you're Christian
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:48.240]   because the easiest thing to do if you grew up in that culture is to remain there.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:53.680]   So you happen to run into a bunch of Christians, and so they happen to be your best friends.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:58.400]   So the easiest thing for you to do is to stay in that, and in order to stay in that, you
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:02.000]   just jump through the hoops that they jump through.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.080]   But never following Jesus Christ.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:10.260]   There's a reason why God calls people out into the desert.
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:17.800]   He breaks them away from their community and makes them stay alone with God for a period.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.760]   Because God does not call us in communities.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:25.200]   He calls us one by one.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:33.160]   The sociological aspect of modern Christianity that you and I experience is so powerful that
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:44.240]   it can easily deceive nominal Christians that we hold on to this community for dear life.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:50.360]   Even when false doctrines are being preached, even as it slips, you hold on to community
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.500]   for dear life.
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:46:00.360]   Because what we are following is cultural Christianity and not Christ.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.640]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:08.600]   I learned this when I was younger back in college, and I shared with you because my
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:14.060]   parents moved around so much, there was a longing in my heart to belong somewhere.
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:18.320]   And I couldn't articulate that when I was younger, but I realized that that was what
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.640]   was going on in my heart.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.400]   I didn't belong here.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.860]   I didn't belong in Korea.
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:29.400]   And then right when I was confused, puberty hit, you know, junior high school.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:33.020]   That's why I started getting into a lot of trouble.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:37.960]   And then in the midst of all of that, I became a Christian.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:44.600]   And when I became a Christian for the first time in my life, I felt I belonged.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.920]   I felt like I'm part of his kingdom.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.920]   I'm not American.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   I'm not Korean.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.160]   I'm a citizen of his kingdom.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:55.080]   And so I didn't even realize what was going on in my heart.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:59.160]   But when that happened, nothing else mattered to me.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.680]   Because I wanted to belong to this.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.720]   I mean, I practiced baseball.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:09.600]   I tried so hard to get on this team and everybody that I knew, instantaneously I lost interest
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.120]   because that's not the community that I wanted to be part of.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.320]   I wanted to be part of this community.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.840]   So I went to their Bible study.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.120]   And they spoke Korean.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.040]   My Korean was not that good.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:25.540]   But I had to learn because that's the community I wanted to belong to.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:29.400]   To this day, I have songs memorized in my head that I don't know what it means.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.500]   Because I sang it for like four years.
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:37.840]   And then I came to college and there was this campus ministry.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:42.080]   And my former youth pastor asked me, "Hey, Peter, you want to be disciple?"
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:45.660]   And I was, "Yes, that's the reason why I came to Biola."
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:50.800]   So he started meeting up with me and I didn't realize that he was part of this campus ministry.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.200]   And then I started really growing.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.760]   I started getting excited.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.520]   And I joined this ministry and we would have meetings.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:59.160]   And at that time, I was the youngest guy there and all of my roommates were 10, 12 years
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.440]   older than me.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:06.320]   But I was elated and all of a sudden, it became a thing at Biola.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:11.880]   Even though it was a very small campus, all of my peers started joining this ministry.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:15.520]   So even though I was the only one at that time, all of a sudden, six months later, this
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:21.280]   tiny little ministry of like three or four or five people, it grew to about 50.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.240]   All my age people.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:27.040]   And for the first time, not only did I feel like I belonged in God's kingdom there, I
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.520]   was a physical community.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:33.080]   I never felt that at church, in neighborhood, anywhere.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.120]   And it was fun.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:40.120]   You know, have friends to hang out with, you know, leading worship, praying together, evangelizing
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.120]   together.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:48.480]   But about eight, nine months later, they all started leaving.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.360]   They started having problems with ministry and then it was no longer the cool thing to
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.360]   do.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:58.120]   So as much as they came in all at once, they started leaving all at once.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:02.440]   And I was so tempted because for the first time, I felt like I belonged somewhere.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.720]   And I got a small taste of what it felt like to belong somewhere.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.560]   And then they left.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.960]   And I was so tempted to leave with them.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.640]   Because for the first time, I belonged.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:23.000]   And so I was really on the verge of telling my leaders that I'm going to leave.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.200]   But I can't deny what happened with God.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:31.560]   And so it was in me that was competing with my loyalty to God and this.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.560]   And I was rationalizing, it's the same thing.
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.400]   Why can't you have both?
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.580]   And I genuinely was confused.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:43.920]   So I decided that I'm going to give it six months.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.320]   I'm going to wait six months.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:50.960]   And if I feel the same way after six months, whatever I'm saying like, oh, I got to leave
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:51.960]   because of this and this.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.480]   If I feel the same way, and this isn't just an emotional tug because I want to belong
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:59.760]   to that group, then in six months, it'll be more clear.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:09.320]   Sure enough, six months came and it became crystal clear that I needed to stay.
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:12.840]   What I was being challenged by, what I was learning, was greater than any fellowship
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.160]   or whatever that I thought I was going to miss in doing that.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:22.800]   The reason why I tell you this story was because that made such a huge impact in my heart because
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.120]   I was already committed.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.760]   I was already saying, I'm going to give my life and I'm going to follow Christ and I'm
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:29.760]   going to preach the gospel.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.240]   I was already committed.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:40.720]   But that desire to want to belong was so strong that I was rationalizing in my head, I can't
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.600]   possibly do this or else I'm going to lose my friends.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.440]   I'm not going to be able to be a part of this community.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:57.480]   And at the end of all of that, I realized, wow, that pull, that peer pressure is so powerful
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:02.280]   that if I'm not careful, I can live the rest of my life jumping through hoops to try to
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:13.500]   belong somewhere while denying Christ in the name of Jesus.
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:20.320]   The truth will always pull us out of our comfort zone.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:24.000]   Don't look around to see if your friends are doing it.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.600]   If you have a community of people to do this with.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:36.440]   First and foremost, do you believe what the Bible says?
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:48.380]   From my experience, if you follow Jesus genuinely, you will experience loneliness that you may
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:53.620]   not have experienced if you weren't a follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:52:01.640]   Some of the most intense feeling of loneliness came after I made a decision to follow Jesus.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:09.500]   As much as I wanted to belong, as much as I desired to belong, the feeling of being
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:17.880]   isolated was never more intense than after I truly committed my life to Christ.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:22.760]   And that's why he became my affection.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:27.920]   He's more to me than anything else in this world.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.200]   Even my wife, even my children.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:37.320]   Because they're fallen creatures like me.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:42.720]   I want to end with this challenge.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:49.680]   Have we sanitized the gospel like the Noah's Ark, where the punch and the power of the
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:54.480]   gospel is no longer relevant in your life?
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:59.760]   You've sanitized it to the point where we made a to-do list of things that we do.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:04.000]   And if you behave this way, if you say certain things, if you go certain places, then I'm
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.840]   okay with God.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.120]   Yet it does not fit the message of the cross.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:19.280]   The wrath of God is being revealed against all unrighteousness.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.080]   A third of heaven will be wiped out.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:25.800]   And all of that, all of everything that we see in the book of Revelation, is actually
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:34.480]   God being merciful so that sinners would see that and repent.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:43.920]   But when the end comes, there is no more patience, only righteousness.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:48.960]   And he will divide between those who are covered and those who are not.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.720]   Those who believe and those who do not.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:56.480]   Those who followed and those who did not.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.440]   Broad is the way that leads to destruction.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.200]   Narrow is the gate that leads to eternal life.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.920]   And few will be found in it.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.800]   Please be that few.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.720]   Please be that few.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:17.560]   Do not let peer pressure keep you in nominal Christianity.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.280]   Love Christ.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.520]   Love Christ.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.080]   Love Christ.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:32.080]   Let's pray.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:38.440]   Heavenly Father, we pray that the truth of your word will not just go through one ear
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.560]   and out the other.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:45.960]   Lord, we pray for revival.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:54.040]   We pray for men and women who take your warning seriously and embrace the truth of salvation
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.840]   seriously.
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:59.480]   That we may live up to the calling, live up to the gospel that you have given us.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:05.360]   That we may live worthy of what we profess week after week.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:12.800]   Lord, as you warned us that in the end times, that because of the increase in wickedness,
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:17.120]   the love of many will grow cold.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:23.520]   Help us, Lord God, that we would not be a part of that many.
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:30.440]   That we would strive to be the few that believe and act.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:34.720]   That we may also be heirs of righteousness by faith.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:36.920]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:37.160]   Amen.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:46.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
