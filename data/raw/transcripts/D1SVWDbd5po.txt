[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   What other name remains undefeated?

[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Who else could rescue me from my failure?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Who else would offer his only son?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Who else invites me to call him father?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Only our holy God.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Only my holy God.

[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Worthy of all the praise you could ever give.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Worthy of every breath you could ever breathe.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Give that to you.

[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Jesus, a name above every other name.

[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Holy.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Holy, there is no one like you.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   There is none besides you.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Open up my eyes in wonder.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Show me who you are and fill me with your holy spirit.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I'm forgiven 'cause you were forsaken.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I'm accepted, you were condemned.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I'm alive and well, your spirit is within me.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Because you died and rose again.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Sing that again, I'm forgiven.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I'm forgiven 'cause you were forsaken.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I'm accepted, you were condemned.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I'm alive and well, your spirit is within me.

[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Because you died and rose again.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Amazing love, how can it be?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   That you, my king, would die for me?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Amazing love, I know it's true.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   It's my joy to honor you in all I do.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I honor you.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   You are my king.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   You are my king.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Jesus, you are my king.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Jesus, you are my king.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Amazing love, how can it be?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   That you, my king, would die for me?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Amazing love, I know it's true.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   It's my joy to honor you.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Amazing love.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Amazing love, how can it be?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   That you, my king, would die for me?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Amazing love, I know it's true.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   It's my joy to honor you in all I do.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I honor you.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   In all I do.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   I honor you.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   All right, good morning.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Welcome to Breen Community Church and those of you who are
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   worshiping with us online.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   As crazy as things are here at home, if you, again, know any
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   missionaries who are out in the field, whatever country you may
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   be in, the craziness that's going on is multiplied outside.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   And so I hope you guys are able to just continue to pray for
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   our missionaries.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   This coming Friday, we have a praise and prayer that's going
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   on, and instead of normal Bible study that we have, so whether
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   it's home group or small group, we're taking a break this week
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and then this coming Friday, we're going to gather together
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   for corporate prayer at 730.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And the layout is going to be very similar to what it is.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   We're going to have people who are able to come inside, be
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   inside.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   When this is full, we're going to have the people go outside,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   and so we're able to worship together that way and take some
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   time to pray.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Pastor Alex, who is our missionary out in China, he's
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   going to come and give an update on what's going on so that we
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   can take some time to pray for our missionaries.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   And so that's taking place this coming Friday at 730 p.m.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   So please mark that on your calendar, and we want as many of
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   you guys who can come to come so that we can pray together.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Bring in membership class.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   That's taking place on November--sorry, not November,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   October, September 27th, okay, at 9 a.m.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   That's coming next Sunday at the cafe area.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   So those of you who are new to the church may not know where
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   that is.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   If you go from the outside, as you come into the front of the
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   building, there are stairs that go upstairs.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And up those stairs, there's a cafe area in that area.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   So if you sign up for that--again, this is a membership
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   class, so if you're participating in that, please go
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   up there.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And if you have any questions, please contact Pastor Nate
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Kwok.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   His email is right there.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   It's right there for me, but not for you.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   On the app or Facebook somewhere, and please email him,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   and he'll give you directions of what to do, okay?
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And it's going to be an eight-week class from 9 a.m.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   to about 10.30, okay?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Newcomers Welcome Event, that's also taking place next Sunday
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   at 2 p.m.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   It's going to be online, and this is for people who just have
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   questions about the church, want to know more about the church.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Some of the leaders will be participating in that.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   And then so it'll--we'll give you more information of what we
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   believe, how things are run, and so it's a good opportunity
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   just to get to know the church.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So if you're interested in that, please contact the Welcome Team
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   after service, or you can go on the church app or Facebook page
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   and it'll give you directions on how to get involved with that.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   And they'll give you the entrance into the Zoom room
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   if you do that.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Intentional Sisters Fellowship, they're going to be reading the
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   book "Hunger for God" by John Piper.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   So some of you guys may have read it because we read this book
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   before in the church, but again, I want to highly recommend.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   This is a great book if you want to learn about praying and fasting
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   and general hunger for God.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And so if you want to participate in that, let the sisters know.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Again, Carrie Cheng is the one who's signing up or taking care
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   of the sign-ups and stuff, so you can go to the app or the
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   church Facebook page, and again, you'll be able to sign up
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   for that.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And then finally, we're going to have some announcements that are
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   coming for our education department, but we'll save that
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   for next time.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   But in October, you know, normally we have Reformation Night.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   We have the room set up and the children can come, and instead
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   of going out, you know, doing trick or cheating, they come here
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   and we have some lessons on the Reformation.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Well, we didn't want to cancel it because of what's going on,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   so we are taking it outside, and Pastor Mark has named this
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   "Trunk Formation."
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Okay, so let me explain the word "trunk formation."
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   So basically, what's going to happen is there's going to be
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   some volunteers who's going to decorate the trunk of their car,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   and that's where the games are going to be taking place,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   whether it's, you know, darts or whatever that kids are going
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   to play, are going to do that, and then the prize will be handed
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   out that way, and then there's going to be a brief teaching
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   on the Reformation.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   I think this year they're going to cover John Calvin, and then
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   there's going to be crafts that's going to be taking place
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   inside here, but kind of spread out.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   So we didn't want to take that day away from our children,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   so we are going to be having that on October 31st from 4 to 7 p.m.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   So there is no cost involved.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Obviously, we do want to limit the number.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   We don't want it to be too full.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   From what I'm hearing, this, you know, the trick-or-treating
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   or that kind of stuff is just canceled in most areas,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   and so if you are planning to come, if you wish to come and bring
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   it, you know, the kids with you, please let--let's see.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Well, I don't know who's in charge, but let Pastor Mark know,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   and he'll be able to give you more information on that.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   So we are having it on Saturday from 4 to 7 p.m., okay?
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   All right, so before I pray, Nick is going to be being baptized
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   after the worship set, so we'll welcome him right after the second.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   So let me pray for us, and those of you who are outside,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   our physical offering basket is in the back of the sanctuary,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   so after the service is over, if you have a check you want to drop off,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   you can come into the sanctuary and drop it off into the box
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   that's near the AV room.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   So right at the entrance of the AV room, there's a box you can drop it off.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Same thing with people here. If you want to--if you have a physical check
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   you want to drop it off, you can put it in that box, okay?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   All right, let's pray.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   to be able to worship you together.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   We know that we are living in difficult times,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   and many churches are wrestling with how to be wise during this period,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   and so we pray for continued wisdom, continued unity, Lord God,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   in the body of Christ, that we may honor and glorify you in all things.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   We pray that the worship that we give you may truly be in spirit and in truth.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   If there's any self-righteousness in us, if there's anything in us, Lord God,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   that is unworthy of you, we pray, Father God, that those things may be revealed.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Help us, Lord, to give to you what you deserve, our heart, our mind,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   our thoughts, our very lives, and that this worship may simply be
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   a reflection of all that you've given us.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   I pray for the offering that we give, may it be multiplied for your glory.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   [music]
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Good morning, church family. My name is Nicholas Nguyen, and this is my testimony.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   So, coming from a loving, non-Christian family, religion was a very small aspect of my life from an early age.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   The first time I attended church was when I was 13 years old. At that point, I was curious about the faith, but I was far from being saved.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   I did not understand how Christ dying on the cross was an act of love, but I knew that he was the way to heaven.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   And since I just wanted to fit into the church setting, I would pray thanking God for saving us from something I could not understand—sin.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   However, seeing how some of my peers who called themselves Christians performed questionable actions, I thought that as long as I was a good person, I would go to heaven.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   With this shallow understanding and a hardened heart, it did not take much for me to stop going to church.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Entering college, I had no thought of joining a college ministry on campus or attending a church again.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Through my experiences, I never understood the importance of attending church if people were just going to act the same as good people in the world.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   In a sense, I thought of myself as flawless and self-righteous.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   I would constantly judge others to boost my own confidence, and I thought that I was heaven-bound because I was not a particularly bad person.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   With my ignorance towards sin and my earthly ambitions, I never thought much about my spiritual well-being.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   However, even through my arrogance, God still brought me to a college ministry with my cousin.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   When I went to the meeting, I was met by a group of very welcoming people.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   That night, the thing that surprised me was how everyone pointed everything back to God.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Seeing such a faithful community, it made me question why they were so intentional.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Through my curiosity, I started attending Berean Community Church.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   The first sermon I heard was about the parable of the wheat and the tares in Matthew 13, 24 to 30.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   This parable challenged me to think about the life of a Christian and the difference between a believer and a non-believer.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   After hearing more messages, one message about compassion and selflessness caused me to examine myself.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Before, I thought of myself as a pretty selfless person.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   I always wanted to help others when they were in a bad spot and would always make time whenever someone needed me.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   But in the realization that I was just doing all this to gain recognition and self-glorification, I understood my own sin and saw my own brokenness.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Before, through my own standards, I thought that I could judge if a person was good or bad,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   which was why there was a contradiction between God's love and justice in my head.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   But when I realized that even myself, whom I thought was righteous and was broken like the rest of the world,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   I was able to understand the need for a Savior, the need for Jesus Christ.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   One of my favorite passages in the Bible is Ephesians 2, 4 to 6, which says,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   "God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   made us alive together with Christ. By grace you have been saved, and raised us up with him,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Jesus Christ.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Even though each and every one of us deserves eternal death, God's love pardoned us.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Through God's grace, I was able to receive Christ into my life.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   I felt a deep joy knowing that my debt from sin was paid.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   After being saved, I continue to see my own need for a Savior.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   My struggle with my own pride and lust continues to be present.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   However, knowing that God has released me from the bonds of sin, and loves me, a sinful and broken person,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   I am able to find comfort and peace in Christ."
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Thank you.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   [applause]
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   [microphone feedback]
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Alright, Nicholas, you understand when you go into the water, you're being united with Christ in his death,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   and when you come out, you're being united in his resurrected life?
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   I do.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   The Son, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   [applause]
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Alright, thank you, Nicholas, for your testimony.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 10,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   we're going to be finishing up our sermon I started last week, verse 32, sorry.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   To 39.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Hebrews chapter 10, verse 32 to 39.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Reading out of the NASB, "But remember the former days when after being enlightened,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   you endured a great conflict of suffering,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession of a lasting one.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   you may receive what was promised.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   For yet in a very little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   But my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   my soul has no pleasure in him.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   We are not of those who shrink back to destruction,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   but of those who have faith to the persevering of the soul." Let's pray.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Christian loving Father, we thank you.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Thank you for the privilege that we have to come and worship you,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   to enter the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Lord, whatever we have been distracted by, whatever we have brought into this room,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   whatever we have been entangled with throughout the week,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   we thank you for this time that we may be able to offer it up
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   and give to you a worship that you truly deserve.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   May your word have its effect on us. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Alright, so as you guys know, this is the second part of the text that we're looking at,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   verse 32 to 39. And again, as you know, it is connected to the previous passage
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   where he gives a warning. He basically had 10 chapters of calling people back
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   to being anchored in Christ, the supremacy of Christ, how he is greater than everything else,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   and warning them in the previous text a couple weeks ago that there are serious consequences.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   This is not just a suggestion. That if a Christian or someone professing to be Christian
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   continue to slide to the point where we no longer recognize him as a follower of Christ,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   he says, "Whatever we said in the past really doesn't matter because there is a stark warning."
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   In fact, the most severest warning was found again a couple weeks ago
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   when he said, "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   But again, the point of that was not simply to end with that.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   The point of that is for the hearers to have a seriousness of what he's been saying
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   all up to that point, and really to get the genuine Christians
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   to recognize how serious this is and to encourage them to persevere.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   And so the exhortation that we were looking at this started last week
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   was an exhortation to persevere by looking at the past.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   It's an exhortation to persevere by looking to the future,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   and an exhortation to persevere by recognizing who we are in the present.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   So today we're going to be looking at the exhortation to persevere by remembering their future.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   But just so that we can connect this to the passage that we were looking at last week,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   it starts by telling them, "Remember in the beginning
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   when you suffered many things and even your possessions were being taken,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   and that you had people around you that was being dragged into prison."
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   So this was no ordinary just kind of, you know, pointing fingers and people snickering at them.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   We're talking about their livelihood.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Some of them, at least during the time that this was being written,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   if Nero was in charge, which most people believe,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   we're talking about a situation where Christians are being dragged into the Colosseum,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   being torn apart by animals.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   And he reminds them, "Do you remember that time in the beginning
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   when you suffered?"
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   You know, and we talked about that last week.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Why would he point that out?
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   If he wants them to persevere, why would he remind them of the intense suffering
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   that they came from in the midst of the intense suffering now?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   He said the difference between the beginning and what they were experiencing now
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   is in the beginning, in the midst of this intense suffering, he said they had joy.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Now that they're in this intense suffering, they're experiencing fear.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   So the distinction between what they were experiencing then
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   and what they were experiencing at the present time
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   is the way that they were responding to this persecution.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And so he doesn't tell them, "Remember the beginning, how courageous you were.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Remember how disciplined you were. Remember how organized you were."
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   He doesn't tell them that. He points them back.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   The reason behind why you had joy in the midst of suffering
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   is because you were anchored in Christ then.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   But since then, you've drifted.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   You have forgotten who Christ is.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   It's not fresh in your memory.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   You're relying on your own strength.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   So now you're facing this persecution.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Instead of causing joy, it was causing fear.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   And really, that's the whole point.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   That's the whole point of what he's been trying to say all through Hebrews.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   And he's going to continue this point all throughout.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   That if we're not remaining in Christ,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   it is not the circumstance.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Right now, we're in the middle of a pandemic.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   We have an election that's coming up.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   We had an earthquake, you know, just this Friday.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   We had all this crazy fire.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   We have civil unrest because of race relations.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   We have missionaries who are being kicked out of the countries
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   that they've been in for decades.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   I mean, all kinds of craziness is happening right now.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   The temptation that you and I can get into
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   when things are stirred up is simply, wait.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   If we pray, if we're faithful,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   maybe all this will pass and we'll go back to normal.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   And maybe we can get back together, enjoy fellowship.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Maybe we can go to restaurants.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   And maybe the political situation will be better.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Maybe the race relationship will be better.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   And if we pray enough, our circumstances will calm down
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   and things will get better.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   So persevere, stay the course.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   But that's not what he says.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   He doesn't promise that things are going to get back to normal.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   He doesn't promise and say,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   if you just continue down this path,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   just wait a little bit longer,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   that God's going to deliver you from this
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   and things are going to be okay.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   He doesn't say that.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   There is no promise.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Now, there are periods of life where we experience peace.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   And there are periods of life where there is tremendous turmoil.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   But God doesn't promise that things will get better.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   He doesn't promise that we're going to live a life of peace.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   But what he says is,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   the distinction between joy and fear
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   was not the circumstance.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   It was their anchoring in Christ.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   And that's why he says,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   do not forget.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   And that's why even David,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   when he repents of his sins in the book of Psalms,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   he says, what does he say?
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Remember that song that we sing a lot?
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Restore unto me, what?
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   The joy of my salvation.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   The greatest concern that he had
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   as a result of his sins
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   was he lost the joy of his salvation.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   So, when an individual is not anchored in Christ,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   any little discomfort,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   any little thing that can go wrong,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   causes turmoil,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   a relational issue.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Maybe you didn't get the job that you wanted.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   Maybe the circumstances isn't exactly what you wanted.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Maybe you wanted to go to a vacation
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   and the prices went up.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   You can rock your boat.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   But when we are anchored in Christ,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   even in the midst of suffering,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   it's an opportunity to glorify God.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   And as crazy as things have been,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   and I think most of us who are old enough,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   I think most people will admit
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   that as crazy as things have been in the past,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   this is pretty crazy.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   2020 is pretty crazy.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   But along with the craziness,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   we also have to admit
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   that there have been more opportunities
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   to glorify God in this midst because of this.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   More opportunities to share the gospel,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   more people who are searching,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   more people who are looking.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   So when you're not sober,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   we may just look at this situation as
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   we need to just persevere and get back to normal.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   And not looking at it as an opportunity to glorify God.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   That's the difference between an eternal perspective
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   and a temporary perspective.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   So last week he says,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   "Remember, because you drifted away from Christ,
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   that you forgot even in the midst of suffering
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   how you rejoice."
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   But today we're going to be looking at
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   the second part, it says,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   "Exhortation to persevere by remembering,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   remembering that this is not all.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   There is a reward coming if you continue to persevere."
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Verse 34b,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   "Knowing that you have for yourselves
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   a better possession and a lasting one."
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Not only is it better,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   but it is permanent.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   That whatever is being sacrificed now,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   whatever we need to endure now,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   he said, "Compare to what's coming."
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   He says, "It is not worthy to be compared."
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Verse 35,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   "Do not throw away your confidence,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   which has a great reward.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   For you have need of endurance."
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   He says it again, verse 36,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   "For you have need of endurance,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   so that when you have done the will of God,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   you may receive what was promised."
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   He says it over and over and over again in this text.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   That the motivation behind our perseverance
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   is to look to the future.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Not to the future next year,
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   or after college,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   or after you set it down,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   or after you bought a house,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   or after your kids are raised.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   He said, "In the future, when Christ comes."
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   And that's why he says,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   repeatedly, over and over again,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   "The key to our perseverance
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   is constantly looking to Christ
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   and comparing what's coming with Christ
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   with what we have now."
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   But if we're not anchored in Christ,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   we only see Christ as an avenue
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   to make this situation better.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   And if you're living by flesh
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   and not by faith,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   all we see is,
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   what is this going to produce
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   for the next stage of life?
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   So, I don't mind, just like we put money in the bank,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   we take it out of my pocket, put it in the bank.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   If I can earn interest,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   and then I can pull it out when I need it.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   But what would cause an individual
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   who has money in his hands,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   security in his hands,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   and to be willing to give that up
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   simply because of a promise?
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   That is not tangible.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   You cannot see, you cannot taste,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   you cannot touch.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Why would an individual
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   who has his security in his hands,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   and he desires right in front of you,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   to be willing to put that away
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   simply because somebody said
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   that there's a better investment
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   if you persevere and endure?
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   And I'll give you the answer to that.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   It's pretty simple.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   It's because you believe.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Only an individual who believes
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   the promise of eternal reward
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   would be willing to let this go.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   There's a reason why, you know,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   when we're suffering, we're having hard times,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   and we can't find a job,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   we cling to God because we have nothing to lose.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   You know, we cling to Him.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   God, help me get a job.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Help my children be healthy.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Help our marriage. Help this.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   And we cling to God, but as soon as
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   we have something tangible in our hands,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   we don't really need Him anymore
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   because I have what I need in my hands.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   In 2 Corinthians 4, 17-18, it says,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   "For momentary light affliction
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   is producing for us an eternal weight of glory
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   far beyond comparison."
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   You know what's interesting here?
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   It says, one, this, whatever suffering
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   that you're going through, it's momentary.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Right?
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   Compared to the eternal glory, it's momentary.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   And then he says, "Light affliction."
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   Now, if you look at that and say,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   well, maybe it's light, you know,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   it's pretty relative, right?
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   They're snickering and pointing fingers
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   and saying, "Oh, I don't want to be his friend."
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Is that what he means when he says light?
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   I think you and I all know
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   that the first century Christians,
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   their persecution was very intense and physical.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   You remember in Corinth?
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Apostle Paul was very concerned about going in there
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   because he was being beaten and chased out
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   from every city.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And Jesus had to speak to him,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   not to be fearful because I have people here,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   but he was heavily persecuted even in Corinth.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   And when I say heavily persecuted,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   we're talking about beatings.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   We're talking about being thrown into jail.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Many people, this was already happening
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   during this period, but the way Paul describes it,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   it says, "Momentary light affliction."
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   And the reason why he's able to call it
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   momentary and light is because he's comparing
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   with the eternal glory beyond what?
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Comparison.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   He's comparing his suffering
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   to the eternal glory that is coming in Christ,
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   and in comparison,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   it's momentary and it is light.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   You see why?
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   If we take our eyes off of Christ,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   I mean, how can you call that light?
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   I mean, when you're suffering,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   it feels intense.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   And that's why his point is
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   not to simply be courageous,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   not to simply be organized
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   and to be better disciplined,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   but it says the Christ who saved you in the past
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   is the Christ that we need to be able to see.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   It's the Christ that we need to be anchored to
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   that's coming.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Again, in Romans 8.18,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   "For I consider that the suffering of this present time
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   are not worthy to be compared
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   with the glory that is to be revealed to us."
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Again, in comparison.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   I mean, who wants to suffer?
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   If it's a safer neighborhood,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   I mean, Irvine is always voted
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   as one of the top cities to live in
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   because it's safe.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   Nobody chooses a house where it's dangerous.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Apostle Paul says,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   "But in comparison,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   in comparison with the glory
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   that is to be revealed."
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   He said this momentary suffering is nothing.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   And then in Philippians 3.8,
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   he says, "More than that,
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   I count all things to be lost
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   in view of the surpassing value
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   In comparison.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   Remember Apostle Paul?
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Remember who he was before he met Christ?
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Apostle Paul was already famous.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   He was one of the top scholars
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   in the Jewish community.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   People say that he may have already been
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   a member of the Sanhedrin,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   one of the senators of Israel.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   He was already a rich man.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   He already had the Roman citizenship.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   He was already at the apex
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   of what the Jewish community
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   would have wanted.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   That's just a portion of what Apostle Paul had.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   But he says,
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   in all that he has had,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   all the respect, all the money,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   all the honor, all the fame that he had,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   all the political power that he had,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   he says, "In comparison
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   to the surpassing knowledge
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   of knowing Jesus Christ,
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   it became," what? "Dung."
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   So the moment we take our eyes off of Christ,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   how can we in our flesh
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   look at what Apostle Paul had
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   and say it was dung?
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   We don't look at winning the lottery as dung.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   We don't look at moving into a nice house as dung.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   We don't look at getting promotions
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   in our work as dung.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   When these things happened, we say,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   "God was so good to me.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   What a blessing that my business is doing well.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   What a blessing.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   My child was sick and now he is well."
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   Nobody looks at that and says, "As dung."
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   It is only in comparison
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   to the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   So therefore, once we begin to drift away from him,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   you cannot in your flesh
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   win over the temptation,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   especially where you and I live.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   I mean, you and I live in an area
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   where if we dream it,
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   we can actually do it.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   I mean, some of you guys may know,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   some of you guys may be shocking to you.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   Majority of the world
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   does not get to look at a magazine
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   in a beautiful place and say,
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   "I'm going to go there one day."
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   That's ridiculous.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   Majority, 99% of the world
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   does not have the opportunity.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   That's just a fantasy.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   That's just like me saying, "One day, I'm going to fly."
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   Because they're struggling to feed their children.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   They're struggling to get a job.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   But where you and I live,
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   we think about career.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   Am I satisfied in my career?
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Even that idea of career,
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   there's a bunch of things that you and I do
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   that people in the world would not understand.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Garage sales,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   the idea of having too much,
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   so we got to sell it for cheap.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   Something that I bought,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   upgrading our phones.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   These are things that if you travel
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   around the majority of the world,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   it's ridiculous.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   But you and I live in this place
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   where we are constantly bombarded.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Everything that we see,
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   if you eat it,
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   that's on my bucket list.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   I'm going to go there.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   And we can actually go.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   It's just a matter of making time.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   You and I cannot,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   by our own flesh,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   win the temptation
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   that you and I are surrounded by.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   It is only in comparison
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   to the surpassing knowledge
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   of knowing Jesus Christ.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   So the moment you take your eyes off of that,
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   temptation will creep in.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   It is impossible to win over the temptation
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   when we have drifted away from Christ.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   That's why he says,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   do not throw away your confidence.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   Okay, so we're doing
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   inductive Bible study.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   And in interpreting a text,
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   what is one of the most important things
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   that you need to do
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   in understanding a text?
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   It starts with a C.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   Context, right?
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   You guys have your masks on,
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   so I have no idea what you're saying.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   Context.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   So context, context, context.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   So if I say, "The bomb,"
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   you don't really know what I mean.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   I could mean,
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   there was a terrorist that planted a bomb
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   to get out.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   Or I could mean,
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   that was awesome.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   The bomb.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   So you have to know,
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   is that part of my normal vocabulary?
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Just kidding.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   Right?
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   I love using that term.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   So when you say, "The bomb,"
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   normally that's not how I talk.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   So you have to understand the context of who I am,
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   how old I am,
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   would I use that, have I used that before?
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   So all of that.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   So when we're interpreting the scripture,
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   you can't just take,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   this is what you think it means
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   and just add it to that.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   That's why the digging happens, right?
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   That's why we're asking questions
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   and you have to understand the context.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   How did he use that word?
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Confidence, the word confidence
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   simply means to be bold.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   But boldness can mean a lot of things too, right?
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   You can be bold, being courageous,
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   not having fear.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   But what is this confidence,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   this boldness that he's referring to?
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   Well, the author uses it several times
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   prior to using it here.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   And so let me look at this
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   so that we can have a better understanding
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   when he says, "Do not throw away your confidence."
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   Hebrews 3.6.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   "But Christ was faithful as a son over his house,
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   whose house we are.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   If we hold fast our confidence
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   and boast of our hope firm until the end."
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   What does he mean here by confidence?
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   Your courage?
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   What does he mean by here, confidence?
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   He's talking about the blood sacrifice of Christ.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   That our confidence to come to Christ
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   isn't because you're bold,
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   isn't because you're righteous,
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   isn't because you've done these great things.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   He says, "No, do not throw away
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   the confidence in you, the blood sacrifice,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   so you are able to be bold."
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   Again, he says it in Hebrews 4.16.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   "Therefore let us draw near with confidence
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   the throne of grace so that we may receive mercy
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   So what does he mean by confidence?
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   Because you're older,
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   because you're more experienced,
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   because you study the Bible better,
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   because you have a position in the church.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   What does he mean by that?
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   The blood sacrifice of Christ.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   He said we are able to enter the throne of grace
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   with confidence because Christ covers us in our sins.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   Because we have been atoned for,
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   our sins have been atoned for.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   So he says we can draw near to the throne,
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   the throne, the king, with confidence.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   He's not talking about us.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   He's not talking about our righteousness.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   He's talking about the imputed righteousness of Christ.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   Again, in Hebrews 10.19-20.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   "Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   by a new and living way,
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   which he inaugurated for us through the veil
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   that is his flesh."
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   Just in case we didn't know,
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   just in case after he said all of this
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   that anybody was missing the point,
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   he actually describes it here.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   Confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   The living way, a new way.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   So what does he mean here?
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   He says do not throw away your confidence.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   Meaning, do not try to continue on this path
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   by your own strength.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   You're not going to be able to make it.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   If we drift from being anchored in Christ,
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   the Christ who justified us,
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   and the Christ who will glorify us,
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   and if we try to add anything to that,
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   you will end up throwing away your confidence.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   The only way that you can have confidence
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   is to enter the throne of grace.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   And that's what he means to be anchored.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   And there's a reason why Jesus,
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   in his seven "I am" statements in the book of John,
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   his last thing that he tells his disciples to do what?
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   To remain.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   He doesn't say go.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Before he goes, you have to remain.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   Before you preach the gospel,
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   before you convert unbelievers to Christ,
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   before you engage in this spiritual battle,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   he says to remain.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   That's why a Christian
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   who's studying the Bible,
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   but is not praying,
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   is completely impotent.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   Because it is not our knowledge.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   It is not our will.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   It is not our courage.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   It is by his might.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   It is by his strength.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   And that's why he says you have to remain.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   You cannot bear fruit.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   You cannot engage in this spiritual battle
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   unless we remain, continue in Christ.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   Unless we are absolutely dependent and anchored
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   in the Christ who saved us
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   and in the Christ who will glorify us.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   That's what he means by confidence.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   Do not forsake this confidence.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   You know, the problem is,
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   when we first become Christians,
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   you know, we are so enamored by our justification.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   And we're humbled, usually.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   Because we've just recognized
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   that every righteous deed that we did
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   and we recognize all the sinful things that we've done.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   And so we come to church and we're humbled.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   We want to know what the Bible says.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Every song, every word
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   is impacting us because that's me.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   That's what he did for me.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   But for whatever the reason,
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   after two months, a year, ten years, thirty years,
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   we add to our justification our works.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   That I've done this and I've done that.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   And we compare our righteousness.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   At least I'm not as bad as them.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   You know, I know I'm not perfect.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   And whenever somebody states that,
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   states anything with, "I know I'm not perfect,"
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   you know what's coming.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   Right?
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   I know I'm not perfect, but I'm not as bad as them.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   So for whatever the reason,
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   we start out with justification
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   and then we add our own righteousness as we go along.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   And the longer that we've been a Christian,
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   the longer we compare our righteousness
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   to other people.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   And we're no longer students.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   We're mighty warriors by our own strength.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   And we become absolutely impotent.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   That's what he means.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   There is not a single person in this room
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   who is not in dire need
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   to fight to remain in Christ.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   You know when you really need to remain?
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   Is when you're young.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   You know, when you're in high school,
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   you just graduated high school,
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   and you're college students.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   Man, you really need to remain in Christ.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   You are desperately in need of Christ.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   You don't have your parents
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   looking over your shoulder,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   and all of a sudden you're able to stay out late,
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   hang out with your friends.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   And there is great temptation that comes
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   with the freedom,
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   with all the choices that are in front of you.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   So if you don't anchor yourself to Christ,
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   you can easily drift.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   You know who else is in need
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   of desperate hanging on to Christ?
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   Those of you who just graduated.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   You just graduated,
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   you're in the workforce,
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   you're working,
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   and all of a sudden you don't have
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   the accountability that you had before.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   The majority of the people that are surrounding you
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   are not like you.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   In fact, you're kind of weird.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   And so you're being tempted to drift.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   So if you're not anchored in Christ
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   during that period,
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   you can easily drift.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   In fact, the statistics say
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   more than 60-70% by the time they graduate
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   before they become 30,
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   they've already drifted and they're gone.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   So the key is to really cling on to Christ
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   to those of you who are dating.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   Those of you who are dating,
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   The temptation, the struggle,
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   and even the miscommunication.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   Your world gets flipped over upside down
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   every time you have a fight.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   And if you're not anchored in Christ,
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   it's a very, very difficult period of life
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   that you're not going to make it through.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   You have to anchor in Christ.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   You're desperate.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   You know who else needs to really cling to Christ?
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   Those of you who are not dating.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   You know, you're living in coveting
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   and watching and saying,
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   "Why isn't this happening to me?"
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   And then your mind starts to drift away
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   and after a while, say, "Why is God,
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   why did God put me in this situation?"
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   And your coveting causes you
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   to drift away from Christ.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   And if you're not careful
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   and you're not anchored in Christ,
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   this envying and desiring
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   and all you are thinking about
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   is the next stage of life.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   And if you're not anchored in Christ,
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   you're not engaged.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   And you're looking to the next stage of life
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   and then those of you who just got married
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   and all of a sudden you feel like you've arrived
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   and then you're no longer
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   actively pursuing Christ anymore
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   because you're relaxed.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   You know?
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   And you're just waiting to have kids
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   and get to the next stage.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   You're enjoying the things that God has given you
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   and the next thing you know,
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   you've drifted together.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   And it's much harder to remain sober together.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   So during that period,
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   if you're not really anchored in Christ,
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   you can easily drift away.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   You know who else really needs
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   to be anchored in Christ?
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   Brand new children,
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   the parents who have kids.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   Oh my gosh, I don't even have to explain.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   Everybody who's like half falling asleep
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   or the parents who didn't get enough sleep last night,
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   they're free.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   What do you do in your free time?
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   And they get angry that you asked them that.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   Right?
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   Free time, what is that?
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   So if you're not anchored in Christ
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   you're not even doing anything bad.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   You're just trying to feed them
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   and take care of them
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   and make sure they're not sick
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   and not getting hurt.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   And you're literally giving your life
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   to another human being
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   and you're huffing and puffing
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   just to make it to the next week.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   And if you're not anchored in Christ,
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   you do that for a year, two years,
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   five years, ten years,
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   next thing you know,
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   you don't even remember what you were like
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   before you had kids.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   And we're parents who have children
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   who are beginning to grow up
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   and move out.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   As we hit our 50s and 60s
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   we kind of drift into this oblivion
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   thinking like, oh, hard life is behind us
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   and we can just kind of drift
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   and just kind of coast along.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   Waiting for retirement to happen
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   because retirement is close.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   And if we're not careful
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   we can just kind of coast along
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   and drift.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   And if we're not really anchored in Christ
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   we're just kind of waiting
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   to drift along.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   But there is a period
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   when you don't need to worry so much.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   It's when we die.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   That is the only period in life
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   where you don't have to be
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   so worried about being anchored.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   The temptation that we have
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   is we think,
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   and I can tell you right now
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   that every stage,
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   no matter what stage you're in right now,
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   that you probably agree
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   with everything that I said.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   You're probably thinking
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   during that stage,
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   yeah, it is tough.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   It is tough being married.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   It is tough having a kid.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   It is tough going to college.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   I didn't realize the temptation that's there.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   Man, it's tough graduating.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   And all of you,
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   whatever stage in life that you're in,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   you agree
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   that there is pressure
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   to constantly drift.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   But the temptation is to think
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   that if we change this circumstance,
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   if we change that,
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   that maybe it will become easier.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   Every stage of life,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   there's a different challenge waiting for you.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   Every stage of your life
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   until we meet Christ.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   The Bible says in 1 Peter 5,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   "Be of sober spirit,
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   be on the alert.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   Your adversary, the devil,
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   prowls around like a roaring lion
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   seeking someone to devour."
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   He is never at rest.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   The spiritual battle
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   is not just when we're young,
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   when we're single,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   it's not when we get married,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   it's not when we have kids.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   Until the day we die,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   we are in this spiritual battle.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   And that's why the moment
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   that we are not anchored in Christ,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   we will drift.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   That's why he says again,
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   35, "For you have need of endurance."
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   And then he says again,
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   verse 36,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   "For you have need of endurance."
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   Now, whenever you see anything
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   in repetition in the Bible,
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   emphasis, right?
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   So if Jesus has something
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   really important to say,
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   what does he say?
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   "Truly, truly, I say to you."
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   If Peter is about to put his foot
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   in his mouth or maybe after he put
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   his foot in his mouth,
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   Jesus say, "Simon, Simon!"
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   In other words, pay attention, right?
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   If I wanted people to pay attention,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   you'll hear my voice go up.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   I don't do that deliberately,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   that's just the way I talk.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   I talk like that even off the pulpit.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   If I get excited, it tends to go up.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   If I really get excited,
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   sometimes you'll see me
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   banging on the pulpit.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   I don't do that deliberately,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   it's not on my notes, bang here.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   It just happens, I get excited.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   Or if I plan it, I might put it up
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   on the screen and say,
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   "This is important, you need
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   to pay attention to this."
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   Well, obviously the authors of the Bible,
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   the way they communicated is
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   they did it by repetition.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   That's why we know that the holiness
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   of Jesus is repeated three times, twice.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   In Revelation, the book of Isaiah,
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   he is holy, holy, holy.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   I say all of this because
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   he says in repetition,
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   "You have need of endurance."
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   That's really how he's saying this,
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   because he repeats it twice,
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   back to back.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   It is not, "You should endure."
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   "Try to endure."
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   That's not what he's saying.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   "You have to endure."
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   One of the key elements
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   of our assurance of salvation
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   is perseverance.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   You must persevere,
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   because one of the true evidences
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   of our saving faith
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   is perseverance of our faith.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   Now let me tell you why he says that.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   Because the Bible describes
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   a non-Christian becoming a Christian
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   of his eyes being opened
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   And you can never go blind again.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Once you've seen it,
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   once you've genuinely seen the glory
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   you can't ignore that anymore,
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   even when you are struggling.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   Even if you've drifted for a period.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   You can't just close your eyes and say,
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   "I'm going to pretend like I've never seen that."
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   You can't re-close your eyes.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   Just like if you've tasted
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   something really good,
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   you say, "Oh, I'm going to act like I never..."
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   No. What you've tasted,
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   what you've experienced,
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   you can't reverse that.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   And that's what he means
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   by perseverance of the saints.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   If there was genuine faith,
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   you may drift, you may struggle,
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   but you can never shut that door again.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   And that's why he says,
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   "You have to persevere."
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   You have to persevere,
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   because that's not who you are.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   God had made you a creature of light.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   And if you drift into darkness,
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   you will sense that you do not belong.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   And that's why he says,
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   "We are not of those who shrink back
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   and are destroyed."
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   That's not us.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   God fundamentally changed our nature.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   We feel alive in the light.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   We feel free in righteousness.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   God had changed
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   the affections of our hearts.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   So that what we long for is Christ.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   And so we may be temporarily stumbled,
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   we may be temporarily tempted,
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   but a true child of Christ will endure.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   And he says,
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   "Yet in a very little while,
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   he who is coming will come
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   and will not delay."
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   Did you notice the repetition in that too?
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   He says three times,
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   "He who is coming will come
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   and he will not delay."
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   So again, what does it mean
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   when he says it in repetition?
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   Let me read it the way
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   that we should read it, okay?
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   "For you need to endure,
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   you need to endure,
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   he is coming, he is coming,
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   he is coming."
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   That's how it was meant to be read.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   He said, "We need to endure
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   because this is momentary."
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   Whatever temptation, whatever struggles,
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   whatever period of life that you are in,
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   it is temporary, momentary,
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   and it is light in comparison
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   to the glory that is coming in Christ.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   So if you've forgotten about that,
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   if that's a distant memory,
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   that's the reason why we're struggling.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   That's why our sanctification is so hard.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   Because we want something
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   and then we come to church
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   and the pastor keeps telling you,
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   "You can't have it."
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   That's what sanctification is,
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   when you've taken your eyes off the prize.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   Here's a bunch of nice things that you want,
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   you can't have it.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   And then you try to forget about it during the week
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   and then you come and you say,
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   "You can't have it again."
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   And all churches, a constant reminder
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   of the things that you love,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   things that you want,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   and then me telling you, "You can't have it.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   You can't have it."
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   If that's what sanctification is,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   you're not going to make it.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   So he says to remember the God who justified us
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   and remember the glory that's coming in this guy.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   In a little while.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   How can you even say a little while?
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   It's been 2,000 years.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   That preaches well, but what does that mean
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   after 2,000 years?
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   Well, time is really relative, right?
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   If I say a year to a 50, 60 year old,
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   the year is like, "Oh, that's just around the corner."
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   You tell that to a five year old, "A year!
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   That's 20% of my life."
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   Let me illustrate it this way.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   Imagine if you're on a cruise.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   I don't know if any of you have been on a cruise.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   You're on a cruise and they drop you off
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   at a nice, beautiful island.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   You go on and you're supposed to enjoy yourselves
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   and you're supposed to come back by 4 o'clock
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   because the ship's going to take off.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   And once they take off, they're not going to be able
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   to come back.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   They're not going to be able to just drive
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   and meet up with you.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   Once they're gone, they're gone.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   They told you to come at 4.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   You ventured out because you wanted to see the hills,
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   but then you got a flat.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   And you know they're going to leave at 4.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   And there's no other ride to get back.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   And so you put on the backpack,
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   you put on your running shoes,
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   and you try to run as fast as you could.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   You're looking at your time,
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   and you're running and running and running.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   And the ship's about to go.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   4 o'clock hits and you're not there.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   And you're waiting and waiting.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes go by.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   And they wait as long as they could.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   And at about 5 o'clock they say,
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   "You know what? We've waited."
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   And so they shut the thing and then they go.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   And so for the people who are running
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   to get to the boat,
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   they've done everything that they could,
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   but they left too early.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   They missed it.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   But the ones who are sitting in the boat,
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   it's like, "Oh my gosh, what is wrong with this boat?
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   "They said 4 o'clock, but now it's 5 o'clock
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   "and they don't keep their promise."
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   I told my friends that I was going to meet them
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   at the other side, but they left at 5.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   So to one group they didn't keep their promise,
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   and they didn't leave on time.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   And then the other group,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   saying they left too early.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   See, 2 Peter 3.9, it says,
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   "The Lord is not slow about His promise,
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   "as some count slowness,
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   "but is patient toward you,
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   "not wishing for any to perish,
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   "but for all to come to repentance."
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   Do you know when this was written?
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   First century.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   About 30 years after the death and resurrection of Christ,
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   the early church, early people say,
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   "Where is He?"
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   Do you know why He was probably saying that?
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   If you know the context of the letter of 1 Peter,
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   He's writing during a period of Nero's intense persecution.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   So they wanted relief.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   So they're saying, "Why isn't He coming?"
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   I mean, our friends are being dragged in the Colosseum,
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   being torn apart by lions,
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   why isn't He coming?
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   He said, "He's going to come,
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   "He's not going to delay."
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   Where is He?
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   They were saying that in the first century.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   It's been 2,000 years since.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   But the reason why He hasn't come yet
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   is because of me.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   It's because of you.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   Because He was holding up the boat
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   until we got in.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   So when He says He's not going to delay,
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   He's not going to delay.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   He's not going to delay any longer
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   than He needs to
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   until the full number of His elect come in.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   And He will not delay
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   any more than until
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   everyone whose name is written in the Book of Life
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   comes in to the boat.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   But let's see it from another perspective.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   No matter how long we've waited,
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   there's nobody in human history
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   that waited more than 100 years.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   Nobody.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   Unless you were born and you got saved
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   at three months old
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   and then you lived to 100.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   Right?
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   Even if we did wait eagerly,
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   you know, I got saved, you know,
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   37 years ago
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   and I've been waiting 37 years.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   I don't know how many more years to go.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   But at some point, I won't be here.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   My waiting will end.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   So no human being has really waited 2,000 years.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   At best,
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   maybe one, I don't know of any,
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   possibly 100.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   But when He says He will not delay,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   this is not an exaggeration.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   But He says we are not of those
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   who shrink back in our disorder.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   That's not who we are.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   If the Holy Spirit is in you,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   you will not feel joy
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   outside of Christ.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   Outside of Christ.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   If you are a Christian,
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   even in the midst of pursuing the world,
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   there will be an emptiness in your heart.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   Even if you don't recognize it.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   Like you, you, something is off.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   You may not be able to pinpoint it,
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   but something is off.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   Even as you're pursuing, even as you make money,
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   even as your business is thriving,
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   something is off.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   Because God created us
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   to be creatures of light.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   You may stumble in the darkness.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   You may find a little bit of life
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   in the darkness.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   But there is no true life.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   And that's why He doesn't say,
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   "Hey, prove yourself to be in the light."
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   He says, "No, we are not.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   We are not of those who shrink back."
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   So let me conclude with this.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   In 1 John 3, 1-3, He says,
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   "See how great a love the Father
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   has bestowed on us."
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   The word "see" is translated
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]   in other parts of the Bible
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   as translations "behold."
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   It wasn't just meant to be
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   just kind of casually look.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   He says, "Behold how great a love
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   the Father has bestowed on us."
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   In other words, think carefully,
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   meditate carefully.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   If you do not see the great gift of salvation
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   that we have in Christ,
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   behold what love the Father
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   has bestowed on us,
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   that we would be called the children of God.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   You know your sins.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   Even before you came in,
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   we're all nicely dressed,
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   our hair is combed nice, right?
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   Most of us.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   And we're presenting our best,
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   but you know your sins.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   You know
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   the lust in your heart.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   You know the bitterness.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   You know the hatred.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   You know how you've drifted.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   When we recognize who He is,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   and we look carefully
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   of what He calls us,
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   that's why He says, "Behold,
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   behold
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   how great a love
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   the Father has bestowed on us,
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   that we would be called the children of God,
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   and such we are."
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   Anchor in Christ,
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   and anchor in Christ to come.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   For this reason the world does not know us
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   because it did not know Him.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   Beloved, now we are children of God,
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   and it has not appeared as yet
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   what we will be.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   If you consider carefully,
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   behold what manner of love
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   and who we are in Christ,
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   that what we are experiencing now
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   is only temporary,
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   and is only partial,
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   and whatever we are beholding,
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   the true ramification of this
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   is coming in Christ.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   We know that when He appears,
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   we will be like Him,
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   because we will see Him just as He is,
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   and everyone who has this hope
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   fixed on Him
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   purifies himself
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000]   just as He is pure.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   So as we are wrestling,
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]   and I know there's every single one of us,
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   no matter what stage in life you are,
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   we are all wrestling.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]   The temptation to drift
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   is tremendous,
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   and if we don't actively,
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   purposefully, deliberately,
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   willfully anchor ourselves in Christ,
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   we will drift.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   So behold what manner of love
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   that is given to us,
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   that we are called the children of God,
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   and those who fix their eyes upon Him
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   will purify themselves,
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   and will endure.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   Let's pray.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   Heavenly Father,
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   we thank you for your continued blessing.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   I pray especially for my brothers and sisters
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   who are drifting now,
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   whether here,
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   or whether online,
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   or at home,
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   and we caught ourselves,
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   our hearts being hardened,
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   and the things that are eternal
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   just doesn't seem to matter
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   as much as it used to.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000]   Help us, Lord God,
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   that your word would strengthen us.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   The Holy Spirit that you've deposited in us
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   that is groaning on our behalf,
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   that we may be united with you for eternity.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   Help us, Lord God,
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   to groan along with the Holy Spirit.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   Help us, Lord God,
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   to be desperate and to seek you
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   with all our heart.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   Help us, Lord,
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000]   that our confidence is in what you have done
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   and not in our own righteousness,
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   that we would not forsake our confidence.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   Especially, especially now, Father,
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   as the world becomes darker
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   and more and more lost
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   every single week,
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   I pray, Father God,
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   that your spirit would be mightier,
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   that your word would be stronger,
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   that your word would be more powerful,
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000]   and that your church would do
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   what you've called us to do,
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   to be a light in this dark world.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   So for that end, we pray for your blessing.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   Let's all stand together for a closing praise.
