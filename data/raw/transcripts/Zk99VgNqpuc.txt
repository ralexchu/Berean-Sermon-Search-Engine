[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:56.020]   All right.
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.020]   I'd like to just go before the Lord.
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:01.020]   Pray for his blessing.
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:04.020]   Father, we want to thank you again.
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:12.020]   And Lord, we know that actually your word you have said is really clear.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:21.020]   In some sense, God, you just, you've repeated yourself and your teaching over and over again to us.
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:28.020]   So it is our prayer, God, that whenever we see it, Lord, that we would be moved to conviction.
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:31.020]   We would be moved to incredible trust.
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:39.020]   And God, would you also challenge us then to greater measures of applying those things into our lives.
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:42.020]   We thank you again for the ministry of your word.
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.020]   It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:52.020]   So by way of brief just review and an overview of the paragraph that we're looking at.
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:08:01.020]   Remember that Apostle Paul was essentially asking them this to compare and contrast.
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:04.020]   And before you were like this, you were like a child.
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:07.020]   Before you didn't even know God, you didn't even perceive him.
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:11.020]   But now that you know him, how can you go back to slavery?
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:20.020]   And that he essentially made this incredibly personal and I want to say emotional plea saying I am begging you.
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:24.020]   Do not go down this path. Be like me. Be free.
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:34.020]   What I wanted to do is take a moment to review the previous just like last several verses that we saw last week.
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:37.020]   And to review that, I'm going to read it.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:44.020]   And as I do it, I'm going to say I'm going to kind of draw for you where I would draw the lines if I'm studying.
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:52.020]   Last week someone mentioned to me, hey, you never kind of explain how you indent and why you color code the way you do.
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:55.020]   My bad. I never gave you guys like a legend or anything. All right.
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:59.020]   But I'm pretty sure it's pretty self-explanatory. But here we go.
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:10.020]   You have done me no wrong. But you know, and what are the things that you know?
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:17.020]   One, that it was because of a bodily illness that I preached the gospel to you the first time.
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:25.020]   And that which was a trial to you in my bodily condition, you did not despise or loathe.
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:31.020]   Instead, you received me as an angel of God, as Christ himself.
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:39.020]   Some of you guys study the Bible this way where you are reading in paragraph style and then you're kind of breaking things up.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:46.020]   This is good to essentially like cut the scriptures into nice digestible chunks so you can study it.
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:51.020]   And what that helps you to do, it helps you to see the phrases and the words that are important.
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:57.020]   I'm going to read you guys because sometimes I actually do lean over and look at your papers to see how you guys are studying the Bible.
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:07.020]   I find that a lot of your papers look like this, which is you make the correct segments of phrases, but it's just all aligned in a certain way.
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:15.020]   With this, what I've done for you is just quickly color coded that this portion in review of the last little segment,
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:25.020]   Apostle Paul was remembering all the good that they had done to him. Very clear, right? You did me no wrong. Green is good.
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:36.020]   But then sometimes you'll see me highlight things in blue, which to me, Marks, I just need to read into that a little bit more or study it because it just raises questions.
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:42.020]   What bodily illness? What condition? Right. But this segment actually is majority green.
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:51.020]   It's him talking about how even though I have this trial and condition, that was a trial to you because it was a burden on you.
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:58.020]   And then he says, you didn't despise or loathe me, but you received me as an angel of God, as Jesus Christ himself.
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:07.020]   For me, I end up doing this kind of indentation because every phrase has a relationship to the other.
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:13.020]   And most of the time it's trying to expand, modify, et cetera, et cetera. Right.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:20.020]   And a lot of times you start wondering, like, why does he even use the word but rather than another type of word?
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:30.020]   For example, one can say you have done me. Sorry. You have done me no wrong. Right. Such as. But that's kind of the way that it reads. Right.
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:35.020]   But what you'll notice is he's thinking wrong instead of wrong. What you've done is this. Right.
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:42.020]   And so these are the things that, you know, you know that this was a circumstance in which I came to you.
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:49.020]   I didn't come to you because I wanted something out of you. I actually came to you because I was sick. Right.
[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:55.020]   And in that context, my love for you was I wanted to keep preaching the gospel to you no matter where I was,
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:12:01.020]   because back in Acts chapter four, when they said keep teaching us, he just kept on preaching to them. Right.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:11.020]   And then it says this was a trial to you in my bodily condition and you did not despise or loathe, but you receive me as an angel.
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:16.020]   So instead of the despise and loathe, you notice he says, but you receive me.
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:24.020]   So if you'll notice, what I do is I highlight all the key, what they call the syntax or is showing you the relationships.
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:33.020]   And I highlight those in orange so that I can see, hey, is this an example? Is this a contrast? Is this a further reason?
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:40.020]   Is this telling me when? Is this telling me how? Is this telling me why? And all of those are really important. Right.
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:46.020]   Because I want the scripture text, even down to the pronoun to dictate for me what I'm teaching you.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:50.020]   But more importantly, what I am receiving as a conviction. Right.
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:59.020]   Those are actually some of the ways that I make my sermons, is if I have a certain sermon about, there's a command that tells you be loving.
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:04.020]   And by the pronouns within the text, I'll actually make my points.
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:09.020]   You need to love people. This is how, this is why, this is who, etc. OK.
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:16.020]   Now, for us, by way of quick review, I wanted to just do this to show you how I do things.
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:24.020]   By way of quick review, we're in a segment where Apostle Paul is saying, look at our relationship. It was so good. Right.
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:34.020]   And so by way of overview, this paragraph that we're looking at today is a personal plea with review of the great relationship that they had.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:40.020]   This was Apostle Paul expressing his heart's intent.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:49.020]   You know, we can already kind of think in this paragraph, then we're thinking alongside Apostle Paul with the mind of ministry.
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:57.020]   That Apostle Paul, as he's speaking the truth, there's actually no way to detach your personal self from the people you preach to. Right.
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:00.020]   Otherwise, you just wouldn't be a good preacher.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:07.020]   Now, I think that this segment, even in his personal plea, has three portions to it.
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:12.020]   He describes the blessed relationship in the first portion up to verse 16.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:19.020]   Then he points to them and says, in our relationship, this relationship is turning sour because of them.
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:24.020]   And those individuals, they're manipulating you. So he points to their manipulation.
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:29.020]   And then he expresses, but this is my heart to you. Right.
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:36.020]   In my preaching, in our relationship, this has been my heart. And he expresses his intention, his desire. OK.
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:40.020]   So with that said, let's jump right into the first portion.
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:43.020]   We're looking at this blessed relationship that we have.
[01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:51.020]   And if you just notice by the color, the whole majority of it is just, and we had it so good. Right.
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:54.020]   You treated me well, you sacrificed for me, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:59.020]   And then at the very end of it, it's like, so, but now I'm your enemy. Right.
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:08.020]   There's almost this tone of this disbelief, frustration, of ridiculousness, almost a sarcasm, like, so I'm the enemy now, you know.
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:16.020]   But let's ask the important question. If Apostle Paul is taking this length to describe the relationship, how good was it? Right.
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:22.020]   How good was the relationship and how does he describe the interaction that even between them?
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:28.020]   And I want to start highlighting it. Right. So the big thing is, he said, man, early on, you did me no wrong. OK.
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:39.020]   And in case the example that he gives, he says in my, in my sickness, rather than despising or loathing.
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:45.020]   And that idea of loathing is very interesting because it describes it as like spitting out something. Right.
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:52.020]   And back then there was so much superstition. There was so much like, oh, my gosh, don't touch me with your sickness. Right.
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:55.020]   Oh, my gosh, that person is a sinner. And that's why they're so sick.
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:03.020]   That person has an evil spirit and that's why they're sick. And so they would literally spit at them or in hopes that the evil demon would be cast out.
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:12.020]   They would do all these things. Right. So rather than doing that, they sacrificed. They bore his burden. Right.
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:18.020]   And now it doesn't even matter necessarily like what kind of sickness it was. Some people think it was malaria.
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:23.020]   Some people think it was like an eye disease because he talks about like, you would have given me your eyes, you know.
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:31.020]   But regardless of how severe or not severe it was, they clearly it was a huge burden on them, but they sacrificed for him.
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:36.020]   And what's more, this portion of it in the previous section was quite wild. Right.
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:41.020]   To what degree did they receive, to what degree did they actually tend to him?
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:50.020]   So as an angel of God and almost like, well, isn't that too much to receive him like Jesus himself? Right.
[01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:56.020]   You read that and it makes you almost feel like, hmm, should they have done that? You know.
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:17:07.020]   But what he's saying is, I'm bearing witness and I've received it. So I know and you know just how good we have this relationship.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:17.020]   In many ways, they were loyal to him. To be willing to be so generous that he says, you would be willing to sacrifice your own eyes for me.
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:25.020]   They experienced a kind of closeness where it was like the great love of the Lord that fills your heart was overflowing to each other.
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:30.020]   They love the message and the messenger. And it was good. Right.
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:37.020]   They had such a love relationship between the two. He described it as like, and I preach to you. I gave you myself.
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:43.020]   And later on, he's going to start talking about, I gave of myself in so many different ways to you. And it was good.
[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:50.020]   So, a brief note that I want to make about that is, that's a good thing.
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:18:00.020]   I hope and pray that our church fellowship would actually be to such a degree where we love the scripture so much, the love of God is overflowing to each other.
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:06.020]   In that, as we fellowship in the word, that kind of intimacy is experienced. It's a good thing.
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:17.020]   Unfortunately, we do kind of live in a generation and time right now where it's my kind of honest assessment that there's a lot of distrust in the generic church.
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:26.020]   There is a lot of distrust. And I can tell when sometimes I meet people, they all start asking questions like, you know, at your church, what kind of safeguards do you have?
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:31.020]   What kind of policies do you have to make sure that the church authority is not abused, etc., etc.?
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:39.020]   And that gives me a clue like, you know, have you had some bad experiences in the past? It makes you a little bit suspicious, you know?
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:44.020]   That kind of doubt and suspicion towards each other is not good.
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:50.020]   Now, I know some things have gotten sour or gone south, and that's why people feel that way.
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:58.020]   But the goal actually is to have such a deep, clear fellowship between the members of the church, right?
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:11.020]   Now, with that said, then his big transition here is to say, we had this sweet relationship, and then there is the two questions.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:14.020]   And the two questions are, where is it now, right?
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:20.020]   First in verse 15 is, where is that sense of blessing you had? So this is the question here.
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:23.020]   And the second was, so I've become your enemy?
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:29.020]   Now, in thinking about that first question, okay, the first question about the sense of blessing,
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:36.020]   I kind of wonder, how did you take that, like, what did you think that refers to, the sense of blessing, right?
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:38.020]   What is the sense of blessing?
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:43.020]   And there were kind of few options, because you could read it in the way that Apostle Paul may be thinking,
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:47.020]   "Hey, where is that kind of blessed love that you had for me?"
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:50.020]   Right? And that's how the NIV translates it.
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:56.020]   Where is that kind of friendly, loyal, sacrificial heart that you had towards me?
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:20:03.020]   But then, the ESV and King James kind of describes it a different way, it's like, where is the sense of blessedness you had?
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:09.020]   I.e., if you really understand the gospel, and all that I was saying before, that you are now sons of God,
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:14.020]   where is that sense of overjoyedness, and blessedness, and happiness in Christ?
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:25.020]   You know? Well, I think, just by way of quickly mentioning, it's okay to think it's both, right?
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:34.020]   Because clearly we know, that when one is incredibly blessed in Christ, that overflows, yes?
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:42.020]   And what's more, the tragic kind of situation we're looking at, is both senses of blessedness are gone.
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:48.020]   Apostle Paul is deeply concerned, because if they go down this route of relying on the flesh,
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:54.020]   trying to seek the approval of men, there is going to be no blessedness, right?
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:59.020]   But what's more, what's happening right now, is this big relationship shift,
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:07.020]   where the enemies, the Judaizers, are trying to win over the Church, and block what Apostle Paul is doing, okay?
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:16.020]   In thinking about this, I want to quickly move to verse 16, where he says,
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:19.020]   "So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?"
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:28.020]   And the question he asks, causes us to think, oh man, did those Judaizers succeed in convincing the Church
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:32.020]   that Apostle Paul is the enemy? That he's the false prophet?
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:36.020]   That he's the one with selfish intentions to, you know, gain something?
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:43.020]   Maybe he's just this egotistical guy, who's proud and has selfish ambition, you know?
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:49.020]   Maybe that is what the Church was tempted to think, okay?
[01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:55.020]   But what Apostle Paul says is, man, he took that risk.
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:22:02.020]   He took that challenge, to rebuke a Church that he loves, to speak truth to them,
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:07.020]   knowing that there was the potential of becoming their enemy, right?
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:13.020]   And so at that juncture, I wanted to highlight something by that point of application, you know?
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:17.020]   Every single one of us, to some degree, experiences a level of fear.
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:20.020]   A level of fear of speaking truth.
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:25.020]   But what's actually interesting, is that a lot of times, that fear is intensified
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:28.020]   when we love the person we have to talk to.
[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:36.020]   And one of the profound examples that I found in the Old Testament, is the prophet Eli.
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:41.020]   You guys know that very famous story that's used often to talk about, like,
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:44.020]   "Hey, listen to God, because He's speaking to you." Right?
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:49.020]   And you guys know the story of Samuel, when he was young, and he heard his name, "Samuel, Samuel."
[01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:52.020]   And so Samuel woke up, and he said, "Oh, Eli, did you talk to me?"
[01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:54.020]   And he was like, "No." Right? And it was God speaking.
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:23:02.020]   And what's crazy about that scene, is God was calling Samuel to speak judgment against Eli.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:05.020]   And that judgment was incredibly, incredibly intense.
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.020]   Take a moment just to listen.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:13.020]   He says, "In that day, I'll carry out against Eli all that I've spoken concerning his house,
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:18.020]   from the beginning to the end, for I have told him that I'm about to judge his house forever
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:23.020]   for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves,
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:25.020]   and he did not rebuke them.
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:30.020]   Therefore, I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:36.020]   shall not be atoned for by any sacrifice or any offering."
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:38.020]   That's pretty intense.
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:44.020]   Eli essentially knew that his sons were offering up false sacrifices, and he says,
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:47.020]   "Because you didn't rebuke them, you are going to be judged."
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:50.020]   And that judgment was so intense.
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:55.020]   First Samuel 2.29 says, "Why do you kick out my sacrifice and my offering,
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:59.020]   which I have commanded in my dwelling, and honor your sons above me
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:06.020]   by making yourselves fat with the choices of every offering of my people?"
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:08.020]   What an intense word.
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:13.020]   And God says to him, "Your whole lineage, there's not going to be a man in his prime,
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:16.020]   because I will cut every single one of them."
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:19.020]   That's one of the scariest things I've heard. Right?
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:22.020]   So my quick point here is,
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:26.020]   sometimes actually the people who are closest to us,
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:30.020]   where the relationship is too valuable to lose,
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:33.020]   will become the hardest moments for us to speak truth.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:38.020]   And by way of applicational question, I want to ask you guys to discuss,
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:43.020]   in what ways can you improve upon your ability to speak truth and love,
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:46.020]   and if you've ever experienced that fear.
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:50.020]   The fear of losing a valuable relationship by speaking so.
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:53.020]   Okay, let's go to the second section.
[01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:58.020]   Chapter 4.17.18. Okay? 17.18.
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:02.020]   So, if you look at 17.18, it says here that they,
[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:07.020]   "Eagerly seek you, but not commendably, but they wish to shut you out,
[01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:09.020]   so that you will seek them."
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:12.020]   So in this context, it's very apparent,
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:18.020]   that these false teachers aren't actually just trying to spread ideology.
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:21.020]   They're actually wanting to make sure,
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:23.020]   that not only do they have these people,
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:27.020]   but they have the people's heart. Right?
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:29.020]   So you guys know what I'm talking about,
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:32.020]   is they're really targeting impressionable people,
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:35.020]   and what really stinks is Apostle Paul here,
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:38.020]   has been raising them, teaching them, etc, etc,
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:41.020]   and now he's losing them to these false teachers.
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:44.020]   There's another passage that has a very similar tone,
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.020]   and he says in 2 Corinthians chapter 12,
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:50.020]   "Here, for this third time, I am ready to come to you,
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:55.020]   and I will not be a burden to you, for I do not seek what is yours, but you."
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:59.020]   Okay? "For children are not responsible to save up for their parents,
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:01.020]   but parents for their children."
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:04.020]   He's talking about his heart for them.
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:08.020]   "I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls.
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:11.020]   If I love you more, am I to be loved less?"
[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:16.020]   So there is this kind of taking a personal tone,
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:18.020]   and that's why last week I asked like,
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:21.020]   are we supposed to never take everything personal?
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:24.020]   Are there moments when you end up taking it,
[01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:26.020]   because you've invested so much of yourself,
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:29.020]   but then you're continuing to love. Right?
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:32.020]   But in thinking about this, this is the sentiment and tone,
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:35.020]   that like a parent losing their teenage kids,
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:38.020]   to a bunch of bozos at school.
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:41.020]   When parents are raising teenage children,
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:44.020]   and all of a sudden, at some junction in their lives,
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:46.020]   friends become so much more important.
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:48.020]   Friends know more, and friends are cooler,
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:50.020]   and friends know best above parents.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:53.020]   That's probably what this is feeling like. Okay?
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:56.020]   But we want to ask this question.
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:59.020]   As Apostle Paul is pointing at the Judaizers,
[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:02.020]   what are their tactics?
[01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:07.020]   What is their way of trying to win the people's hearts?
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:10.020]   And I thought it was really interesting. Right?
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:14.020]   Number one, they're eagerly desiring to seek them,
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:16.020]   and to have them. Right?
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:18.020]   The term for eagerly seek,
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:20.020]   it's used in a lot of different ways,
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:24.020]   but it's like a zealous kind of fake flattery,
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:27.020]   winning them over kind of thing. Right?
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:29.020]   And then you look at what they're doing, it says,
[01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:31.020]   their tactic is to shut you out,
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:33.020]   make you feel like you're not part of the team,
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:36.020]   so that you'd be like, "Oh, come on, let me in." Right?
[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:38.020]   And in the group, one of the guys is like,
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:40.020]   "This is a classic case of hard to get." Right?
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:42.020]   This is them trying to be like,
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:44.020]   "We're so cool, you want to be a part of us?"
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:46.020]   "Well, you can't." Right?
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:48.020]   "Look at you, uncircumcised."
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:50.020]   And then some boy is like,
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.020]   "Oh, I want to be circumcised too."
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:54.020]   And I was like, "I don't know.
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:56.020]   I don't know how that all played out." Right?
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:58.020]   But it's just kind of silly,
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:00.020]   and my immediate question was like,
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:03.020]   "Man, is it really that easy to manipulate people?"
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:07.020]   And my guess, we're a lot like teenagers.
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:10.020]   My guess is the guys who are Judaizers
[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:13.020]   aren't like ugly, like, you know,
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:16.020]   like incapable, just bumbling fools.
[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:18.020]   They're probably well-spoken,
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:20.020]   well-educated guys with clout.
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:23.020]   And all they have to do is walk around a little huddle,
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:25.020]   and a bunch of people are like,
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:27.020]   "Yeah, I wish I was part of them."
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:30.020]   Think about how easy it is sometimes to manipulate us.
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:34.020]   But then, there are just, here, it says,
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:38.020]   what they're doing is they're trying to elicit in you this need.
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:41.020]   And then you think about it again, going back,
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:46.020]   Apostle Peter, even the leaders within the Jerusalem church, yes?
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:51.020]   And so, you know, we have to definitely ask ourselves, like,
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:56.020]   are there similar manipulations
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:29:00.020]   and things that we are so easily gripped by?
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:04.020]   Do I have strange desires
[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:07.020]   where that causes me to be susceptible
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:09.020]   to be just swayed left and right?
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:11.020]   Oh, yeah, for sure.
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:14.020]   In the academic world, you don't want to look stupid,
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:17.020]   so sometimes you just parrot things that other people say,
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:19.020]   because it sounds smart and intelligent.
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:22.020]   Are we not susceptible to that kind of stuff?
[01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:25.020]   I mean, in as much as I want to think that, like,
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:27.020]   I'm my own independent man, I'm a Christian,
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.020]   I don't care, and as Apostle Paul says in chapter 1, verse 10,
[01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:32.020]   am I a person seeking the approval of men?
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:35.020]   And I'm sitting here like, no, I just seek God's approval.
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:39.020]   And yet, I have crazy FOMO, I have crazy, like,
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:41.020]   what are they doing over there, right?
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:44.020]   And so I just want to ask you guys that question
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:47.020]   to also discuss, do we personally have ways
[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:50.020]   in which we're very gullible and easily manipulated?
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:52.020]   We probably do, right?
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:55.020]   Okay, so that was our tactics.
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:59.020]   And then, in verse 18, he says something kind of interesting,
[01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:05.020]   which is, like, stated in a peculiar way.
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:08.020]   He says, it's good always to be eagerly sought
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:11.020]   in a commendable manner, and not only
[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:13.020]   when I am present with you, okay?
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:16.020]   So my guess is some of you guys have to sit there
[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:18.020]   and read that a few times.
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:20.020]   What does that mean, okay?
[01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:22.020]   So I'm not going to take too long over it,
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.020]   but I just want to make mention of the fact
[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:29.020]   that Paul, it's funny, right, because he's seeking them.
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:31.020]   He straight up said, no, no, no,
[01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:34.020]   you need to be like me, 'cause I'm like you.
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:36.020]   We're Christians, we're free.
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:38.020]   We've considered everything lost
[01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:40.020]   so that we can be found in Christ.
[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:42.020]   Be like me, and don't leave me
[01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.020]   because we had a great leadership.
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:46.020]   What happened, right?
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:48.020]   And then he's got these other people
[01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:50.020]   who are also pursuing them.
[01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:52.020]   Well, what he's saying is, no, no, no,
[01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:55.020]   being led by others, being discipled, right,
[01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:58.020]   and being desired by others is wrong.
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:00.020]   Paul is expressing humility.
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:02.020]   I'm actually seeking your good.
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:04.020]   It doesn't even have to be me.
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:07.020]   And a funny, funny example or corollary would be
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:10.020]   me speaking to you guys who are banners.
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:13.020]   I was a banned pastor just six months ago.
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:16.020]   My favorite pastime was to talk about your dating drama.
[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:19.020]   Some of you guys, some of you guys now,
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:21.020]   because we haven't talked in a while,
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:23.020]   a young man comes to me and is like,
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:25.020]   "Oh, Pastor Mark, I'm sorry."
[01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:27.020]   I'm like, "Why?"
[01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:29.020]   "I didn't tell you that I did this thing
[01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:31.020]   "and now I'm dating."
[01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:33.020]   I'm like, "How can you not tell me?"
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:35.020]   No, I said, "No, no, you don't have to.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:37.020]   "You don't owe me.
[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:39.020]   "Talk to Pastor Peter Chung."
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:41.020]   He's like, "Oh, I did, that's great.
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:43.020]   "It's good for you to be led and get advice that way.
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.020]   "But what I'm afraid of are those bozos
[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:47.020]   "who want to be cool counselors
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:49.020]   "and they're like, 'Oh, I'm so happy for you.
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.020]   "'She's so pretty, just do it.'"
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:52.020]   "Oh, you just only live once.
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:54.020]   "Go take your shot."
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:56.020]   Whatever it is, they just give all these crazy,
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:58.020]   crazy advice to be cool counselors.
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:00.020]   Forget them, they're bozos.
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:02.020]   That would be the sentiment of Apostle Paul here.
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:04.020]   Okay, anyway, go ahead and start over there.
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:07.020]   (audience laughing)
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:09.020]   Apostle Paul,
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:13.020]   after pointing to those Judaizers
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:16.020]   who don't actually have a good intention for you,
[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:19.020]   but they want you to play their game,
[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:22.020]   he now turns the picture on his heart and says,
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:25.020]   "Do you know how much I love you?"
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:29.020]   He is very personally expressing his heart's intent.
[01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:31.020]   And so we have to ask the question,
[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:34.020]   in just this two very short verses,
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.020]   what are the various elements
[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:39.020]   of Apostle Paul's heart and intent for this church,
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:41.020]   for the people he ministered to?
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:43.020]   What do we find?
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.020]   And there's a lot, right?
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:47.020]   So starting from here,
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:49.020]   he starts to talk about them as my children.
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:50.020]   And in some of our Bible studies as well,
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:52.020]   I always thought it was hilarious
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:54.020]   because I'm reading it,
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:56.020]   and I just imagine Apostle Paul
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:58.020]   being this much older grandfather,
[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:00.020]   or he's talking to really young people,
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:02.020]   but he's talking to full-grown adults saying,
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:04.020]   "I love you like you're my children."
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:07.020]   And if you guys saw this term right here,
[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:09.020]   in labor,
[01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:11.020]   that is the term for a mother
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:13.020]   who is a child giving birth,
[01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:16.020]   and she's bearing all the pains
[01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:20.020]   of bringing this baby into this world, right?
[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:24.020]   He is in motherly pain over the church.
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:28.020]   That is so powerful, isn't it?
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:30.020]   Apostle Paul, in his love,
[01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:33.020]   he is expressing the intent
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:36.020]   of fatherly and motherly love.
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:38.020]   What's more, here he says,
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:40.020]   "Until Christ is formed in you,"
[01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:42.020]   this is so important
[01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:44.020]   because this is his great goal and intention.
[01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:47.020]   He is going to continue to bear the pain.
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:50.020]   He is going to continue to love upon them.
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:52.020]   He could have very easily said,
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:55.020]   my guess is he's already repeated himself
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:57.020]   multiple times to this church
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:59.020]   because he talks as though
[01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:01.020]   he's already rebuked them,
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:03.020]   and they're not responding well.
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:05.020]   He could have just said,
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:07.020]   "Forget them, do whatever you want," right?
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:09.020]   But no, he's saying,
[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:12.020]   "I will labor until Christ is formed in you."
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:14.020]   This is his goal.
[01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:16.020]   Not to have them be like,
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:18.020]   "Oh yeah, we're of Apostle Paul,
[01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:20.020]   we're of Apollos,"
[01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:22.020]   and he just flat out says,
[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:24.020]   "What are you guys talking about?"
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:26.020]   Let there be no division amongst the Christian body.
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:29.020]   Yes, I want to see Christ formed in you.
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:31.020]   You guys know that that's also,
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:34.020]   in many ways, the key to good parenting.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:36.020]   I don't want, you know,
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:38.020]   what I find in myself,
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:40.020]   I've got to confess,
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:42.020]   I want my kids to grow up like men,
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.020]   and to be strong,
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:46.020]   and to be capable,
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:48.020]   and I kind of pride myself
[01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:50.020]   on knowing how to do a lot of things,
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:52.020]   fix your car,
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:54.020]   and do this and that,
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:56.020]   and fix your house,
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:58.020]   and if there's a problem,
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.020]   you're the fixer, you know?
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:02.020]   And then I realize,
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:04.020]   I'm training my children
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:06.020]   to be independent men,
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.020]   but what if I am training them
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:10.020]   to be independent of Christ?
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:12.020]   I would much rather have them
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:13.020]   be like me.
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:15.020]   The best for my children
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:17.020]   is not them being capable men,
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:19.020]   they have to be Christ-like men.
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:22.020]   It's good parenting,
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.020]   and Apostle Paul has it in view,
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:26.020]   and he's expressing his heart to the church.
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:28.020]   What's more,
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:30.020]   Apostle Paul's intent
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:32.020]   is to be present with them.
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:34.020]   This is a great pastor.
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:36.020]   This is a great smoggle bleeder.
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:38.020]   This is a great brother.
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:40.020]   This is a great sister in Christ.
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:42.020]   You sit there and people have crazy dramas,
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:44.020]   like, "Uh-uh, I don't want no drama."
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:46.020]   That's your problem, not mine.
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:48.020]   That is not a good leader.
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:50.020]   That is not a good friend,
[01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:52.020]   and that is not a good brother.
[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:54.020]   But Apostle Paul says,
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:56.020]   "No, I want to be with you
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:58.020]   "because I'm worried about you.
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:00.020]   "I don't know what to do with you,
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:02.020]   "but I want to be there with you."
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:04.020]   Why? He says, "Man,
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:06.020]   "I want to even change my tone.
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:08.020]   "I don't want to speak like this."
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.020]   Apostle Paul's intent
[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:11.020]   is to be with those who are constantly screaming.
[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:13.020]   He doesn't say,
[01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:15.020]   "It's been my calling to be that guy
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:17.020]   "who just whips everybody into shape.
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:19.020]   "That's my calling."
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:21.020]   He doesn't even talk about his calling.
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:23.020]   He's being driven by the need of the church.
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:25.020]   "I don't want to talk like this,
[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.020]   "but I have to
[01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:29.020]   "because you don't understand
[01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:31.020]   "where this road is going to.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:33.020]   "You turning to your flesh,
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.020]   "you relying on your own powers
[01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:37.020]   "and your works and listening to these bozos,
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:39.020]   "you're going to make Christ
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:40.020]   "a better creator, right?
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.020]   "And so now I have to use
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:44.020]   "my firm father voice with you.
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:46.020]   "I don't want to,
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:48.020]   "but I will."
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:50.020]   Wow.
[01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:52.020]   What a great example
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:54.020]   of one who is
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:56.020]   doing what is necessary
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:58.020]   that he does not ruin the children.
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:00.020]   There are parents
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:02.020]   who are so afraid of their kids,
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:04.020]   afraid of hearing from their kids,
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:06.020]   "I don't love you.
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.020]   "I hate you,"
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:09.020]   whether they're mean or bad.
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:11.020]   Right?
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:13.020]   And that's a real temptation.
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:15.020]   I don't necessarily judge it very hard
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:17.020]   because I can feel it too.
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:19.020]   Who wants to see their kid
[01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:21.020]   look at them with anger and spite?
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:23.020]   Nobody.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:25.020]   And what's more,
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:27.020]   if my kid, I just imagine,
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:29.020]   if my kid's telling me,
[01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:31.020]   "Oh my gosh, those bullies over there.
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:33.020]   "I'm all alone.
[01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:35.020]   "I'm all ostracized from my Jewish friends
[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:37.020]   "because da-da-da-da-da."
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:38.020]   "I can't pick these ones,"
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:40.020]   and da-da-da-da-da.
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:42.020]   A parent looking at their child
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:44.020]   experiencing loneliness
[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:46.020]   is painful on the parent.
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:48.020]   But here and now,
[01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:50.020]   Apostle Paul has to say,
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:52.020]   "No, I'm not going to give you
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:54.020]   "the earthly gift of just friends.
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:56.020]   "I want to have Christ
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:58.020]   "be formed in you."
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.020]   Right?
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:02.020]   Let that be a great, great example for us.
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:04.020]   We too, in ministry,
[01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:06.020]   just as a brother and sister,
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:07.020]   we have to have
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:09.020]   spiritual father-like hearts.
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:11.020]   We have to have
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:13.020]   spiritual mother-like hearts
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:15.020]   where we are even willing
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:17.020]   to plead and beg.
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:19.020]   Right?
[01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:21.020]   Because we know what it would mean
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:23.020]   if someone takes that path
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:25.020]   of a fleshly journey
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:27.020]   to have whatever it is they want on earth.
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:29.020]   You know,
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:31.020]   when we broaden out,
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:33.020]   this paragraph is summarizing
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:35.020]   this spiritual father's plea and begging.
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:36.020]   It makes me think about
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:38.020]   a long time ago,
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:40.020]   there was a young man
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:42.020]   who was very smart,
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:44.020]   very talented, handsome,
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:46.020]   articulate, intelligent,
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.020]   was super into reading.
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:50.020]   And he and I became really good friends.
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:52.020]   We would perform at cafe nights
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:54.020]   and stuff like that together.
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:56.020]   We would sing together.
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:58.020]   Unfortunately, in his reading,
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:00.020]   he got led astray down
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:02.020]   to this hyperversion
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:04.020]   of the gospel-centric movement
[01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:05.020]   and then all of a sudden,
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:07.020]   he left church saying,
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:09.020]   "This church is no good.
[01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:11.020]   "It's not about the gospel."
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:13.020]   Crazy thing is,
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:15.020]   shortly after,
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:17.020]   only about a year or two after,
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:19.020]   I heard news he went to the Catholic church.
[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:21.020]   What?
[01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:23.020]   Well, part of it, in my mind now,
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:25.020]   it makes sense because I believe
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:27.020]   that gospel-centric ideology
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:29.020]   is actually just a fleshly ideology.
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:31.020]   So then when he went to the Catholic church,
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:33.020]   it was strange because he was a popular guy.
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:34.020]   People started posting on his Facebook
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:36.020]   like, "Hey, no judgment.
[01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:38.020]   "You gotta take that path.
[01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:40.020]   "Hey, everyone's on a journey.
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:42.020]   "And I just hope that in the journey,
[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:44.020]   "you're real.
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.020]   "You be true to your real self."
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:48.020]   And somebody even said,
[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:50.020]   "I'm happy for you."
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:52.020]   And I remember thinking,
[01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:54.020]   what in the world kind of stupid flattery is that?
[01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:57.020]   You're just flattering the guy.
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:40:00.020]   And I realized there is a temptation to do that.
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:02.020]   But if I'm actually helping him
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:03.020]   I should have been begging him.
[01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:05.020]   What in the world are you doing?
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:08.020]   Right?
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:10.020]   How can you say I'm about the gospel
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:12.020]   and then leave Christ?
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:15.020]   And I should be pleading.
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:18.020]   And so this is the burden.
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:20.020]   If we have people in our churches,
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:22.020]   near us, in our groups,
[01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:24.020]   or whatever it may be,
[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:26.020]   who are considering going down this path
[01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:28.020]   of not caring, being nominal,
[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:30.020]   and not caring about Christ,
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:32.020]   we have to do the work of ministry.
[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:34.020]   Amen.
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:36.020]   I want to finish off with a powerful verse,
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:38.020]   1 Corinthians chapter 4.
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:40.020]   "I do not write these things to shame you,
[01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:43.020]   "but to admonish you as my beloved children.
[01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:45.020]   "For if you were to have
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:47.020]   "countless tutors in Christ,
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:49.020]   "yet you would not have many fathers.
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:51.020]   "For in Christ Jesus,
[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:53.020]   "I became your father through the gospel.
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:55.020]   "Therefore I exhort you,
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:57.020]   "be imitators of me."
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:59.020]   Let's pray.
[01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:01.020]   Lord,
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.020]   we are so thankful to you
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:06.020]   because you're the God of perfect patience,
[01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:09.020]   and you are the perfect father.
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:11.020]   And scripture would even say
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:13.020]   that you have extended your hand all day
[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:15.020]   to an obstinate people.
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:17.020]   And so God,
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:19.020]   in as much as we see Paul's frustration
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:22.020]   for the church who's maybe becoming defensive,
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:24.020]   we know, Father God,
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.020]   many times we've done it to you.
[01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:28.020]   So Lord, thank you.
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:30.020]   And also we know you've placed us in this church
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:32.020]   and you've granted us brothers and sisters
[01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:34.020]   to plead with us,
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:36.020]   to reason with us,
[01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:38.020]   to give us rationale and give us scripture.
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:40.020]   I pray, Father God,
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:42.020]   that every single one of us
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:44.020]   would have a yielding heart to your word,
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:46.020]   that God, we would truly be submissive to your truth.
[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:49.020]   So Lord, again, we just want to say
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:51.020]   thank you, God, for your messengers,
[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:53.020]   your children.
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:55.020]   And I pray, Lord,
[01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:57.020]   that we, in our hearts' desire
[01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:59.020]   for you to edify one another,
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:01.020]   you would be pleased as the heavenly Father.
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:03.020]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:09.020]   We'll have time for some announcements.
[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:23.020]   All right, thank you, Pastor Mark.
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:26.020]   Just a couple things that are coming up.
[01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:29.020]   As has been announced on the Sundays,
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:32.020]   next, next Saturday, March 9th,
[01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:34.020]   we will be having a,
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:37.020]   like a, we do this about three times a year,
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:39.020]   just a cleaning and maintenance day.
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:41.020]   And the more people that we have
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:43.020]   helping with this,
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:45.020]   the more thoroughly we can clean our church.
[01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:47.020]   And so if you're thinking,
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:49.020]   like, how can I serve the church?
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:51.020]   Well, here's one opportunity
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:53.020]   just to come on one day
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:55.020]   and spend a couple hours
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:56.020]   there will be light
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:59.020]   breakfast-y refreshments provided.
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:01.020]   So please do sign up
[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:03.020]   so that we can kind of assign you
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:06.020]   to a section of the church, okay?
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:09.020]   So we do need a good head count
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:11.020]   so we can also provide for the food.
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:13.020]   So please do that
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:15.020]   and take note of that morning.
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:18.020]   Also, Easter is,
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:20.020]   or the Passion Week
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:22.020]   is just about four weeks away.
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:24.020]   So we don't have that much action,
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:25.020]   much time.
[01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:27.020]   So we're going to be
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:29.020]   going through the Passion Week
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:31.020]   like we've done over the last several years.
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:33.020]   Monday through Wednesday,
[01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:35.020]   we're going to have just a devotional
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:37.020]   focusing on the events of that day
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:39.020]   followed by
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:41.020]   just maybe like a testimony.
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:43.020]   And then Thursday night,
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:45.020]   we typically have
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:47.020]   just like a reenactment
[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:49.020]   of the Passover feast.
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:51.020]   So we eat what
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:53.020]   Jesus and the disciples would have eaten.
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:54.020]   We go through all of that.
[01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:56.020]   And so for you guys
[01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:58.020]   who have never participated in this
[01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:00.020]   and you want to
[01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:02.020]   participate in this,
[01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:04.020]   you can sign up
[01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:06.020]   and priority will be given to you.
[01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:08.020]   And this is for members only, okay?
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:10.020]   So the cost is $10
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:12.020]   and it'll be every night,
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:14.020]   it'll be a 7.30 meeting.
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:16.020]   But for the Thursday,
[01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:18.020]   dinner will be at 6.30.
[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:20.020]   So this is definitely something
[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:22.020]   that you do want to participate in
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:23.020]   at least once, okay?
[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:27.020]   So it's $10 per adult,
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:30.020]   $5 per child under 18,
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:32.020]   and if the child is under 4,
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:34.020]   it's free.
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:36.020]   So please do go ahead
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:38.020]   and sign up for this.
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:40.020]   And as I mentioned,
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:42.020]   we're going to be here every night
[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:44.020]   including Sunday morning
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:46.020]   for the sunrise service
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:48.020]   followed by the Easter service
[01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:50.020]   at 8, 9.30 and 11.30.
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:52.020]   We're going to need a lot of help.
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:54.020]   Help with the parking,
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:56.020]   help with the cleanup,
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:58.020]   help with the setup
[01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:00.020]   because we're here every night.
[01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:02.020]   Help with just making sure
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:04.020]   that our facility stays relatively clean.
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:06.020]   So if you can sign up,
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:08.020]   please do,
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:10.020]   especially for Good Friday.
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:12.020]   Last year we had a little
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:14.020]   over 700 people here.
[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:16.020]   And so we're anticipating
[01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:18.020]   just as much,
[01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:20.020]   just as many or perhaps even more.
[01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:21.020]   We had a little bit of
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:23.020]   a packed house, okay,
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:25.020]   with communion that night.
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:27.020]   So if you can help out in any way,
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.020]   please do sign up for these things.
[01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:31.020]   And then we have some
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:33.020]   important dates to remember.
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:35.020]   This Friday we're,
[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:37.020]   the young adults are going to go up
[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:39.020]   to Pine Valley,
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:41.020]   go down to Pine Valley for the retreat.
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:43.020]   And so please do keep
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:46.020]   the 217 young adults in prayer
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:48.020]   that it really would be a time
[01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:50.020]   of just challenge
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:52.020]   and refreshing.
[01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:54.020]   And next Wednesday
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:56.020]   we don't have Bible study.
[01:45:56.020 --> 01:45:58.020]   Repeat after me, next Wednesday.
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:00.020]   No Bible study.
[01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:02.020]   Which means we have
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:04.020]   an all church praise and prayer
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:06.020]   on that Friday night, okay.
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:08.020]   So it's not like, oh cool,
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:10.020]   this week we don't have Bible study
[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:12.020]   so let's take time off.
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:14.020]   It's not that.
[01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:16.020]   We want it to focus one Friday a month
[01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:18.020]   where we get together
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:19.020]   in prayer and worship.
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:21.020]   So that's Friday the 1st of March.
[01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:23.020]   If you guys are interested
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:25.020]   in the six week Old Testament
[01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:27.020]   survey class,
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:29.020]   it starts on Sunday the 3rd
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:31.020]   and it'll, skipping Easter,
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:33.020]   it'll go to February 14
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:35.020]   at 2 to 3.30 in the sanctuary.
[01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:37.020]   And then as I mentioned before,
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:39.020]   the Passion Week events
[01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:41.020]   and Easter is coming up, okay.
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:43.020]   And I'm going to post these up here.
[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:45.020]   These are the questions that
[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:47.020]   just serve as a guide for you
[01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:48.020]   to share in the discussion.
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:50.020]   And yeah, enjoy.
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:52.020]   (audience chatter)
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:54.020]   (audience chatter)
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:56.020]   (audience chatter)
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:58.020]   (audience chatter)
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:00.020]   (audience chatter)
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:02.020]   (audience chatter)
[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:03.020]   (audience chatter)
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:05.020]   (audience chatter)
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:07.020]   (audience chatter)
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:09.020]   (audience chatter)
[01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:11.020]   (audience chatter)
[01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:13.020]   (audience chatter)
