[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.760]   Lord, we do want to confess our love for you.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:18.440]   We thank you for our mothers who have labored and sacrificed that we may be here as an evidence,
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.180]   Lord God, of your agape grace in our lives.
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.080]   We pray this morning that you would enlighten us, that your word would truly speak to us,
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.240]   cause us to have a greater vision of you, that our life, our worship, all of it, Lord
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.280]   God, may be a reasonable response to what you've given.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.480]   May your word come alive as we continue to seek you.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.600]   Now as I was preparing for this message, you know, I googled "mothers who sacrificed themselves
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.600]   to save their children."
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.600]   Right?
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.400]   I googled to see, you know, if I could find some stories.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.040]   And I was surprised just how many stories, and again, not made up stories, about actual
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.680]   events that are listed on Google.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.820]   And I couldn't, there were so many that I couldn't go through all of them.
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.620]   So many story after story after story about moms sacrificing their bodies to protect their
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.320]   child or in a burning building and finding the mother cradling the child and then the
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.680]   mother burns to death and the child is saved.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.400]   And over and over and over again about stories about how mothers sacrifice themselves to
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.400]   save their children.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.320]   Now I didn't Google fathers.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.840]   Today's not Father's Day.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.200]   So you know, but naturally when we think of mothers, we automatically, and I know that
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.320]   we may not have all experienced childhood in that sense, but just universally, naturally,
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.840]   when we think of mothers, when we think of the greatest love, humanly speaking, that
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.400]   we can relate to is probably a mother's love for us.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.840]   You know, one story in particular stood out to me.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.920]   This lady, a young lady named Chelsea Russell, 35 years old, and she had a two-year-old child
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.240]   and they were in a lake and she turned around and found her child slipped into the lake.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.800]   So instinctively she jumped in.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.560]   And she jumped in and not being a good swimmer, she had to save her child and there was no
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.120]   one around.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.960]   So in order for her child not to drown, she went in under the water and held her child
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.240]   up above the water while she was drowning underneath.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.480]   And she held her in that position for over five minutes before any other relatives realized
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.120]   what was happening and they came out and they got them out of the water.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.980]   But by the time the relatives came to get her, she was already under the water for five
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.320]   minutes, trying to keep her child afloat, and they tried to resuscitate her and they
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.920]   could not and she gave her life trying to save her child.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.840]   Again, I can tell you countless number of stories.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.680]   The only reason why this one stood out, just five minutes, thinking how she probably in
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.320]   every ounce of her energy wanted to get out of that water, but she gave, literally gave
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.360]   her life to save that child.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:15.220]   The Gospel message at the core is about our Savior who gave his life for us.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.820]   The text that we looked at this morning, it ended, last time that we were in this text,
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:26.320]   it ended by saying how God created us in majesty to have all things subjected under us and
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.360]   that it ends at the end of verse eight, but now we do not yet see all things subjected
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.360]   to him.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.880]   In a nutshell, it's a summary of where we are as mankind, that all have sinned and fall
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.660]   short of the glory of God.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.100]   Even though God created man to be a reflection of God's glory, that is not where God sees
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.100]   man today.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.860]   And he said, because of the fall of man, we begin in verse nine, but we do see him.
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.700]   Even though we don't see man in the place where God created him, but now we do see him
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.060]   who was made for a little while lower than the angels, namely Jesus.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.640]   In other words, because we had fallen, Christ came to us in our fallen position in order
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.980]   that he may taste death on our behalf.
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.980]   He came to get us because we could not go to him.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.740]   And that's in a nutshell what the gospel message is.
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:28.020]   He is in glory and honor now, but he became lower than the angels to suffer death.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.260]   You know, if you look at Hebrew chapter 2, 9, it says, we do not see him who was made
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.020]   for a little while lower than the angels, namely Jesus, because of the suffering of
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.780]   death crowned with glory and honor.
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.260]   So if you look at the NASB version, the word for because, it kind of makes it sound like,
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.920]   if you don't read it correctly, that because of his suffering, he was crowned with glory.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.980]   If you look at the King James version, it actually gives a better rendering that you
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.220]   see literally in Greek.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.660]   He says, we see Jesus who was made for a little lower than the angels for the suffering of
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.660]   death.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.100]   Do you get that?
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.580]   Did you catch the subtle difference between the two translations?
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.940]   The NASB and most other translations translates it because, and it makes it sound like, because
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.260]   he lowered himself, he was raised in glory.
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.140]   In actuality, the way it really should be read, like the King James, that Jesus was
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:32.260]   lowered a little while for the suffering and now raised in glory.
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.420]   Do you see the difference?
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.580]   I cannot tell at all.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.820]   Do you see the difference between the two translations?
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.220]   Okay, alright, good, somebody.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.860]   So in the first translation, which most of the other translations have, that because
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.300]   he was lowered, he was honored.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.780]   So the emphasis in that he was honored because he lowered himself.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.900]   In the actual translation, the word for for, gar, is really connected to the previous,
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.860]   that Jesus lowered himself for the purpose of suffering.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.300]   For the purpose of suffering, but now is in glory.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:18.500]   The whole reason why he became a man is to suffer and taste death on our behalf.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.220]   Now whenever we hear the word taste, right, if you want to convince your friend that the
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.780]   boba that you're drinking or the pizza that you're eating is delicious, right, how do
[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.620]   you get them to eat it or order it?
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.520]   Take a taste, right?
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.860]   You buy it and then you're eating it, and say, "Well, just take a bite.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.220]   Trust me, it's good."
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.220]   So the scripture says that Jesus tasted death on our behalf.
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.700]   Now when it says he tasted death, it doesn't mean that he just took a small bite and was
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.180]   like, "Oh, okay, I know what that means."
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:56.980]   The reason why the author used the term taste is because Jesus did not stay dead.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.940]   For everyone else, when we die, it is permanent.
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.940]   That's where we are.
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:01.940]   You don't just taste death.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.900]   You enter into death and that's where you stay.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.380]   But in Jesus' situation, we know that he tasted death.
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.200]   And so it doesn't mean that he only tasted a portion of it.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:18.480]   He experiences death, but it is not his permanent state because there was a goal to him tasting
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.480]   the death.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:26.080]   In fact, in 2 Corinthians 5.21, the passage that we know well, "He made him who knew no
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.000]   sin to be sin."
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.040]   Paul is very precise in the way that he describes this.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.580]   He uses this deliberately.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.360]   You notice that he doesn't say that he made him who knew no sin to be a sinner.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.800]   He doesn't say that.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.760]   You ever wonder why he uses sin?
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.040]   What does it mean for Jesus to become sin?
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.160]   Well, Paul is being very precise.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.200]   Jesus was never a sinner.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.880]   He didn't die because he was a sinner.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:05.160]   He didn't become a human being and lived in humility and became a sinner and died because
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.520]   he was a sinner.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.560]   Paul is being very precise that even though he was crucified on the cross because of sin,
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.760]   it was not his sin.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.500]   He became sin.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.360]   And you notice he goes on, "On our behalf so that we might become the righteousness
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.360]   of him."
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.360]   Right?
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.640]   Righteousness of God.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.880]   Again, Paul is being very precise.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:35.520]   Jesus becomes sin in order that we may become not righteous on our own, not righteous on
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.520]   our own.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.600]   Innately, do you still sin?
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.080]   Are there still lusts in your heart?
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.680]   Do you still have greed and pride?
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:53.920]   When Christ became sin for us, his righteousness was imputed to us in order that when God sees
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   us, he no longer sees sinners, but he sees the righteousness of his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.620]   The language that he uses here is very, very precise.
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.320]   And that's why it's important for us to not to just read it and kind of like, "Oh,
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.760]   Jesus died for us because of our sins and he was raised in..."
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.280]   All of that is true.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:18.680]   But when you dissect exactly what it says, we see a better grasp, we have a better understanding
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.720]   of what it is exactly that he did for us.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.640]   Can you think about what the greatest sacrifice you've ever made?
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.000]   Most people, if you think about the greatest sacrifice, you might try to think of an event.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.880]   But most likely, when you think of the greatest sacrifice, it's not an event.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.840]   It's probably somebody in your life who continuously is watching out for you.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.720]   Small things that they do year after year after year after year is probably a greater
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.520]   sacrifice than one big thing.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.280]   Maybe you graduated and a bunch of your friends got you this nice car.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.400]   Man, that was the greatest thing that I've ever received.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:00.800]   But in reality, there is somebody in your life every single day, every morning, every
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.920]   night, no matter what you do, is behind your back, watching over you, sacrificing.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.560]   And oftentimes, those kind of things don't stand out.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.480]   Until way later, after we've lived many, many years, we look back and think, "Wow, there's
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.480]   somebody who did that for me."
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.880]   Now, obviously, the answer is pretty clear.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.480]   It's Mother's Day.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.480]   And I'm not milking that.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.000]   And I think most people will agree.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.920]   The greatest love that you've ever received, the greatest love that you've probably ever
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.960]   given as a mother is that, to your children.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:42.480]   But the love that you may have sacrificed for or we've received comes nowhere near how
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.320]   the Bible describes what Christ did for us.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:54.200]   I mentioned to you many times that being involved with the homeless ministry for many years,
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.720]   I see why there's such a high turnover rate.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.120]   Because you use your own finance, and you go out there, and you think you're doing something
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.560]   really great.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.200]   And then you go out there, and then every once in a while, you'll get yelled at for
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.840]   not bringing enough coffee, for not bringing enough hot dog.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.000]   And I remember routinely, we would collect jeans and jackets and blankets, and we would
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.220]   go out there and start spreading it out, and we didn't bring enough.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.760]   So every once in a while, we would have a crowd of 20, and then every once in a while,
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.080]   we would have 60 or 70, and we only brought enough for 30.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.000]   And so we have 30 people who are happy and then 30 people who are discontent.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.360]   Why do you guys come?
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.920]   And you experience that once or twice.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.480]   I mean, that's enough to drop everybody.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.920]   Man, these people aren't deserving of this.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.440]   To take time out of your day and collect jeans and your own money to go give it out to these
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   people.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.220]   That's such a high turnover rate.
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.200]   You know, we have these great ideas of what it means to serve sinners, and then as soon
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:58.620]   as you are faced with the sin, our natural reaction is to run the other direction.
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:05.100]   Romans 5, 7 through 8 says, "For one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.060]   for a good man, someone would dare even to die."
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.060]   Maybe.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.720]   You know, we hear stories oftentimes about soldiers.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.900]   You know, they're in a time of war and somebody throws a grenade, and in order to save his
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.720]   friends, they jump on the grenade and he dies.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.980]   Great act of heroism.
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:29.580]   They'll talk about him and remember him the rest of his life.
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:35.260]   But that does not describe the love of Christ, because that was the death that he died for
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.080]   his friends.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.640]   That's not how the gospel is described.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:43.240]   He says, "For a righteous man, for a good man, someone may possibly die.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.680]   And if he does, that person is a hero, will be honored and venerated all of his life,
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.260]   even after his life."
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.320]   But in verse 8, "But God demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.960]   sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.660]   The love of Christ isn't a love for the righteous.
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:10.440]   The love of Christ aren't for the people who are desirable and loving, who are thankful.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:17.480]   The love of Christ is a love for sinners while we were yet blaspheming, while we were yet
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.920]   shaking our fists.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.400]   Christ drew near to us.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:30.680]   Even the people who loves us the most, at our ugliest state, at our most selfish state,
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.280]   they will not tolerate us.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.840]   They'll try their best, but it's difficult.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.240]   If a child acts up, no matter how much you love that child, it is hard when they're being
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   selfish.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.480]   Send them to their room.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:54.400]   See, the illustration of a soldier jumping on a grenade doesn't do the gospel justice.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.880]   He would have to have jumped on a grenade to save the terrorist who killed his family.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.920]   He would have to have planned the whole thing for years and years to enter into enemy's
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:11.440]   territory, learn his language, eat his food, become their citizen, living among them, and
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:17.640]   then years and years and years and years of sacrifice and planning, knowing the exact
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:25.040]   day that that would happen, and you walk in and do that voluntarily to people who are
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.520]   hostile to you and to your family.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.520]   That's how the Bible describes what Jesus did.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.840]   Because all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, because we are not yet,
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.480]   we are not in the position of honor in which God created us.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:49.140]   He says, "Now for a little while we see him who humbled himself, became one of us."
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:53.800]   He was made like us so that he can make us like him.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.220]   He was made like us so that he can raise us back to glory of what he intended.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:08.400]   Jesus humbled himself and he learned under the Pharisees.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.920]   You know, if you've ever read the Gospels, if you've ever read the Gospels, you know
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:19.080]   the kind of disdain that Jesus has toward the Pharisees because of their hypocrisy.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.800]   Even the righteousness that they practiced, it was only for other people to see.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:28.960]   And yet, as a child, he humbles himself and he goes to the temple and he sits under their
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.920]   tutelage, and he learns.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.420]   Think about that.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:40.060]   Think how humbling, think how difficult that must have been, knowing who these people were.
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.540]   Jesus worked with his hands.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.540]   He was a carpenter's son.
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.940]   Think about the paradox of Jesus being a carpenter's son.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.000]   The Bible says that all things were created by his hands.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.140]   And yet he was making chairs and tables, fixing houses with his hands.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:06.980]   It may not seem like much, but for knowing who he is, how humiliating and humbling that is.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:13.500]   Though he was immutable and all-powerful, he tasted fatigue, he tasted hunger, he tasted
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:22.220]   thirst, cold, sadness, loneliness, betrayal, and pain, and all voluntarily.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:28.420]   For a little while, he became lower than his own creation, the angels.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.320]   It wasn't just a nail in his hands and feet and the whip on his back and the crown on
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.500]   his head that describes his suffering.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.860]   Every moment of his human existence was suffering for him.
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:47.120]   To be humbled, another way to describe humility is to be humiliated.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.640]   The reason why we don't like to humble ourselves is because it's humiliating.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.540]   Because we see ourselves a certain way, and that's beneath us.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.060]   And so we try not to put ourselves in those situations.
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:06.940]   His whole life was humiliation, and he did this voluntarily.
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:12.300]   We do not yet see all things subjected to us, but we do see him, who was made for a
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:16.260]   little while, lower than the angels, namely Jesus.
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.340]   You know what's crazy about this?
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:24.740]   I mean, if that isn't crazy enough, if you look at verse 10, it says, "For it was fitting
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:29.360]   for him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.340]   to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through suffering."
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.760]   It was fitting.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:43.100]   How can you possibly describe what Jesus did as being fitting?
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:50.460]   The word fitting basically means to become, or simply, right or proper.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.220]   I hope when you read that, you didn't just pass through.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.160]   Oh, it was fitting for him.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.160]   It was proper for him.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.460]   It was right for him to do what he did.
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:05.220]   How can you possibly say that what Jesus did was fitting?
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.860]   The author of life, everything was made by him and for him.
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.500]   He is the King of kings and Lord of lords.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:21.100]   All the angels worship at his throne, and it was fitting for him to humble himself beneath
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:27.300]   his own creation and to be humiliated as a human being, as a carpenter, and then to be
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.900]   crucified and then mocked and then killed.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.820]   All for what?
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.020]   For sinners who are shaking their fists at him.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.420]   Enemies of the cross.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:45.540]   How can we possibly think that that is fitting?
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:50.600]   The greatest injustice in history is not the Holocaust.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.020]   It is not slavery, as horrendous as that is.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.900]   Even to this day, when we think of US history and slavery, people cringe.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.060]   You want to erase that.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.260]   You know, one thing I learned as I traveled throughout the different parts of the world,
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.740]   every country has certain things that they're ashamed of in history, and they don't like
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.740]   talking about it.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.420]   In fact, oftentimes, if enough years pass by, they just get rid of it.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.220]   People outside the country talk about it, but within the country, they get rid of it
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.220]   in their textbook.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.780]   So the people within their country know very little about the injustices that their own
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:29.060]   government committed against their own people, because they don't like talking about it.
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.820]   They want to forget about it.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:38.980]   We can think of all kinds of injustices that mankind has committed to other human beings,
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:45.540]   but none of that is compared to the injustice that was put on Jesus Christ.
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:51.100]   The greatest injustice in Jesus Christ is the crucifixion of the Son of God, because
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:57.600]   all of the injustices are sinners hurting other sinners.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.940]   People who are under condemnation condemning other people.
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:07.500]   No matter how horrendous it is, because no one is righteous.
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:13.220]   Whether we were, we suffered greatly while we were living, or we suffered greatly after
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.460]   death.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.260]   The scripture says all is under this condemnation.
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:24.360]   Only one person, the king of kings and Lord of lords, suffered this injustice.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.600]   So how can this possibly be fitting?
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.580]   How can this be right?
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.340]   How can this be proper?
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:35.260]   Why would the author use this word?
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:40.580]   You know, previously we looked at Hebrews chapter 2, 6, where David is crying out saying,
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:47.300]   "What is man that you remember him, or the Son of Man that you are concerned about him?"
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.300]   Why do you care?
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.440]   Why do you even know my name?
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.660]   Anybody who has a proper grasp of who it is that we worship, anybody who has a proper
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:02.740]   grasp of who we are, and knows even a bit of the sin that dwells within us.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.760]   That's the first question that we should be asking.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.300]   Not why do you care?
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.300]   Why do you care?
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.780]   Or, why don't you care?
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.420]   But why do you care?
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:16.660]   What is man that you even think of me?
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:23.820]   Now as crazy as that is, that was said in the old covenant.
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.500]   David was in the old covenant before the cross.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.540]   David was perplexed.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:34.740]   Why would this holy God have anything to do with me?
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.500]   From the old covenant.
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:42.540]   Imagine what David would say from this side of the cross.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.140]   Why would you be mindful?
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.140]   Why do you care?
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.140]   Why do you even know my name?
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.780]   But can you imagine if he was looking at the cross, and he had a clear vision of what Jesus
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:57.100]   did, how he would rewrite this?
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:04.500]   What is man that you would send your only son to die for me?
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.300]   What is man that you would suffer and become sin so that I might become the righteousness
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.300]   of God?
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.820]   What is man?
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:16.060]   What have I done?
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:25.100]   Exodus chapter 15, 1 through 6, Moses breaks out in praise because they just experienced
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.580]   delivery from the Egyptian army.
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:33.380]   They come in and they cross the Red Sea, and as a result, they were desperate, and God
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:38.460]   miraculously saves them, and they're on the other side, and they break out into this spontaneous
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.500]   praise to God.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.460]   And Moses sings, "I will sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted, the horse and its
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.740]   rider he has hurled into the sea.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.740]   The Lord is my strength and song, he has become my salvation.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:58.020]   This is my God, and I will praise him, my Father's God, and I will extol him.
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.340]   The Lord is a warrior, the Lord is his name.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:05.680]   Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has cast into the sea, and the choices of the officers
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.180]   are drowned in the Red Sea.
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.620]   The deeps cover them, they went down into the depths like a stone.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.980]   Your right hand, O Lord, is majestic in power.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.060]   Your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemy."
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:20.180]   And he goes on and on for the rest of the chapter, this spontaneous praise to God.
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:27.260]   And there's many records of spontaneous praise when God performs a miracle and delivers them.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:34.140]   But none of these things can be compared to what we see at the cross.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:40.700]   That's why Paul says in Romans chapter 12, in view, in light of this mercy, that he spent
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:46.740]   11 chapters expositing, describing why and what he did and what he accomplished,
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:53.020]   he says, "It is a reasonable response, a spiritual act of worship,
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:57.820]   to give our bodies as a living sacrifice."
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:05.180]   If a simple deliverance from Pharaoh's army broke out into this spontaneous singing,
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:11.740]   what response would God's people give when we come to realization what Jesus did for us?
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.620]   What the Son of God, he didn't just snap his finger and part the Red Sea and then
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.780]   covered over their enemies.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:25.000]   He came down and he took on human flesh, was humiliated all of his life,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.180]   knowing full well that at the end of 33 years of serving them, that they would spit on them,
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:37.020]   mock them, beat him, and then crucify him.
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:43.660]   What kind of praise would God's people give spontaneously when we come to the full realization
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.980]   of what it is that we have in Christ?
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:54.180]   That's why, this is the reason why Jonathan Edwards says in Religious Affection,
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:25:03.420]   "The greatest evidence of someone who has met the Lord is his affection for God."
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.500]   That's the greatest evidence.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.260]   It's not how hard you serve the church.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.580]   It's not how much you study the Bible.
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.420]   It's not how much you give.
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:18.260]   All of these things are byproducts, but the greatest single evidence that somebody met this Lord
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:23.940]   in full realization of what it is that he has done for him, and he believes that with all his heart,
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.380]   is affection.
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.740]   How could you not?
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:32.820]   How can you not love a God who gave you everything?
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.780]   You know why we love our moms?
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.820]   Not because they're prettier than any other moms.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:44.020]   It's not because their breakfast is more tastier than any other person.
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:49.100]   I mean, we could name all these things, and when we're younger, you ask a young child,
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.380]   like, "Do you love me?"
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.660]   You say, "Why?"
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:57.180]   And they'll answer you, "Because you made me breakfast," like the kids, right?
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.020]   "Because I can't buy food," right?
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.780]   They'll give you straight up because that's what they know.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:11.700]   But as we get older, we know that those are very minor things compared to the larger things that
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.620]   every mom did for their child.
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.540]   They sacrificed, they served us, and they loved us so much, and we know that our love
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:29.380]   for our moms is simply a response, a response of realization of what it is that we were given.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:36.820]   How much more when we come to the realization of what it is that we have in Christ?
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:42.260]   Part of the reason why so many Christians live their lives nonchalant,
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:48.700]   almost as if they've never met Christ, is one, that may be evidence that they never
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.380]   met Christ.
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.020]   It could be evidence.
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.860]   They love the church, they love what the church is about, they love the friends at church,
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:01.220]   they love the mission of the church, but they don't love Christ.
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:07.220]   And it could be, I'm not saying it is, it could be evidence that they never really met Christ.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:12.820]   But another reason could be that we are so entangled and tempted with the things of this
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:21.620]   world that we so easily just drift, just like the recipients of the letter of Book of Hebrews.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.180]   It's not that they didn't believe in Jesus.
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:30.100]   There's nothing that Paul or the author of Hebrews is saying that they didn't already know.
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:37.020]   He was reminding them, "Remember when your property was being confiscated and you were
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.820]   fellowship with those who were in prison and you were glad to do it?
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:45.500]   Remember at that time when Jesus meant everything to you?
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.420]   What happened?
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.140]   Why are you drifting back to your old way of life?
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.380]   Remember the height from which you had fallen.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:58.100]   Repent and do the things that you did at first."
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.020]   What does he mean then?
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.860]   It's not fitting.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.700]   It is not fitting.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:08.180]   It is not proper for the Son of God to experience what he has experienced.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:12.700]   When he says it is fitting, basically what he's saying is that the only way that you
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:17.220]   and I could have been saved is through what Jesus did.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.940]   There's no other man.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.060]   There's no other method.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:27.940]   If there was any other way that we could have been saved, wouldn't God have done that?
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:35.580]   If God's righteousness could have been imputed upon us just by God saying, "Forget it,"
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.620]   wouldn't he have done that?
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:43.220]   If there was even a 1% chance that he'd throw down a rope and whoever can climb this with
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.620]   his good works, those of you will be saved.
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.260]   Wouldn't he have done that?
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:55.300]   The only reason why the Son of God was sacrificed on our behalf, because he was the only fitting
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.100]   way.
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.420]   He was the only way.
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.020]   That's what he means by it is fitting.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:07.060]   Not that it is just, not that it is right, but it was the only way.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:12.900]   And not only was it the only way, it was only fitting because that's who he is.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.940]   The Bible describes God as being holy, holy, holy.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.420]   And in 1 John 4:8, it says, "God is love."
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.900]   He doesn't just practice holiness.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.620]   He is holy.
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.060]   He doesn't just practice love.
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.700]   He is love.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.860]   We don't say Jesus is love because we see all these actions.
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.660]   We know what love is because of what we see him doing.
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.260]   Do you understand the difference?
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:41.380]   He is the standard of love because the Bible says he is love.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.600]   So he tells his disciples before he leaves, "The primary evidence that you are my disciples
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   is what?
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.700]   If you have love for one another as I have loved you."
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:58.780]   The primary identity of Jesus that he left with his disciples is his love.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:03.860]   But it is built upon the foundation of his holiness.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:12.460]   So the only way that God's holiness and his love can be satisfied was at the cross.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:16.900]   And when Jesus says, "It is time for me to go to the cross so that I may glorify you
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.980]   so the Father can glorify the Son."
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:25.020]   Basically what he meant was to highlight the cross.
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:30.020]   The word to glorify basically means to take God's nature and put it on a pedestal so all
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.020]   can see.
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.580]   You know, there is a spotlight right here, right?
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:35.580]   There is only one right here.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.580]   We don't have one on you.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.820]   There is only one right here.
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.140]   It's not because I'm better looking than all of you.
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.140]   I'm better dressed.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.980]   Because the word of God is going forth here.
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:44.980]   So we want you to see.
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.740]   That's why in the stage area we have a lot more lights than we do there.
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:53.340]   Because we're spotlighting this area because we want you to pay attention to what's happening
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.020]   here.
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:31:02.220]   When Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross, it was put on a stage to be displayed.
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.340]   And every aspect of the gospel, there's a reason why there's four different gospels.
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:11.420]   Because every gospel highlights a different aspect of the cross.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:16.780]   Of his kingship, of his humanity, of his servanthood.
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.100]   Every aspect of it.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:25.540]   And then after that, all the epistles are describing what other people saw of the cross.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.980]   Paul describes one aspect.
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.540]   Peter describes another aspect.
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.400]   John describes another aspect.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.380]   And over and over again, we see different aspects of the cross.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.660]   Because God's glory is being displayed at the cross.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:39.400]   His very nature of holiness.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.740]   His very nature of love.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:46.540]   If you want to know who God is, study the cross.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:52.700]   If you want to know the core nature of our God, know the cross.
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.160]   Study the cross inside and out.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.540]   And you will see why God displayed himself at the cross.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.060]   That's what he means when he says it is fitting.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.060]   It fits him.
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.580]   That's who he is.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:09.980]   Exodus 34, 6, "Then the Lord passed by in front of him and proclaimed, 'The Lord, the
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:14.860]   Lord God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in loving kindness
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.220]   and truth.'"
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.140]   He wasn't just gracious.
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.860]   He is gracious.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.660]   He wasn't just kind.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:24.660]   He is kind.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.900]   He's the standard of kindness.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:32.660]   Years ago, Dr. Harris came to our church and he gave a bunch of messages that very few
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.340]   people understand.
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.660]   You remember?
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:40.540]   He wrote a book called "Darkness and the Glory," one of my favorite books.
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.260]   Again, very difficult to read.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:48.220]   But in his chapter, he has one chapter called "The View."
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:55.860]   And in the chapter, basically he describes the view that Jesus has from the cross.
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.540]   And he's reciting the book of Psalms.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:04.500]   And he takes bits and pieces of what clearly is messianic and what Jesus is seeing.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.140]   But he doesn't end there.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.100]   He describes the view from God the Father.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.900]   And what is he seeing?
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.660]   Seeing his son being crucified.
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:19.660]   He describes the view of the demons who tried so hard to prevent this and what they are
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.660]   seeing.
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:25.860]   He describes the view of his disciples of what they're seeing as Jesus is being crucified
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.060]   on the cross.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:31.140]   He's describing the scene from his earthly mother.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.860]   What does the cross look like from the earthly mother, from Mary's point of view?
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:40.860]   He describes the view from the Pharisees and the Sadducees who wanted him dead.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.140]   And they're looking at the cross.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.700]   And what are they seeing?
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.980]   What is Judah seeing?
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.780]   And so one by one, he dissects.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:53.740]   And he takes passage after passage after passage after passage, highlighting from every angle
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:57.660]   of the cross what they were looking at.
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.660]   To me, it was mind-blowing.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:06.020]   None of it was new, but all of it put together made so much sense.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:12.900]   All of it was to put Christ and his crucifixion at the center.
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:17.100]   He says he was made perfect, the author of their salvation through suffering.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.860]   How do you perfect someone who is perfect?
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.700]   Paul doesn't even use the word.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.700]   He became a sinner.
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:24.700]   He didn't say that.
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.460]   He said he became sin.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.460]   He's very careful to describe that Jesus was perfect.
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.820]   So what does he mean here?
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:36.020]   God allowed him to suffer to perfect the author of our salvation.
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:43.140]   The word "perfect," "teleo," basically literally means to bring it to completion,
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:45.380]   what God intended.
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:49.980]   What God had planned, what God had ordained, what God had predestined, he was going to
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.020]   allow it to take full fruition.
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:59.140]   So what he means by perfecting the author of our salvation is what he had planned, what
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:05.220]   he had promised in Genesis 315, that the son of the woman was going to crush the head of
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:12.340]   the serpent, that as soon as man fell, God revealed his plan, that my son is coming.
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.340]   My son is coming.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.660]   And for thousands of years, God had been preparing.
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.420]   He's been preparing.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.820]   He's given the law.
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:30.220]   He would correct them, build the temple, made the sacrifices, sent his prophets, wrote scriptures,
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:33.740]   and then finally he sent his only begotten son.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:39.180]   He said at the fullness of time, fullness of time, in God's ordained time, at the perfect
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.480]   time, he said the son of God was sent.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:48.900]   And God, through his suffering, perfected, completed what he had planned.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:56.260]   Jesus came, learned our language, ate our food, made things with his hands.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:02.900]   He learned what it felt to be cold, to be hot, to be fatigued, to be betrayed, to be
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:12.060]   lonely, to be tired, and to be in pain and in agony to the point where he, even though
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:18.500]   he volunteered to do this, as he was facing the cross, he prays to God, "Is there another
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.700]   way?"
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:26.980]   He experienced the anxiety of facing death like any other human being.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:27.980]   And that's what he means.
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.460]   He was perfected, the author of our faith.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.880]   You know the word here, "author" here, archegos?
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.340]   In every translation, it's translated differently.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.980]   In the NASB, it says he's the author of our faith.
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.660]   In the ESV, he's the founder of our salvation.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.500]   In the New King James, he's the captain of our salvation.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.900]   In the RSV, he's the pioneer of our salvation.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:53.300]   And the reason why there's a different word to describe this word "archegos" is because
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:57.900]   it's one of those words that is so rich in theology that you can't capture it with one
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.300]   word.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:05.140]   So you could have written a sentence and described it in all these ways, but they chose what
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:09.500]   they thought their bent was.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:14.300]   But if we were to take this word "archegos" literally, it basically means to lead, to
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:22.900]   originate, to be the founder, to be the chief, to be first, to be prince, and to be distinguished,
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.300]   to be the cause.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.980]   He is the originator, the founder, the leader, the chief, captain, pioneer, first, and the
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.700]   last of our salvation.
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:40.420]   In other words, our past, present, and future of our salvation is firmly in his hands.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.600]   Our justification was made perfect through his suffering.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.900]   Our sanctification is being made perfect through his suffering.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:52.700]   Our glorification will be made perfect through his suffering.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:38:01.500]   This is the reason why Jesus says to his disciples in John 15, 4, "Abide in me and I in you,
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:07.060]   as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.940]   you unless you abide in me."
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:15.220]   He didn't say it'll be very hard for you to bear fruit.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.220]   He didn't say that.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.480]   He didn't say it will be very difficult.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.460]   He didn't say you're not going to like the fruit that you get.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.460]   He didn't say that.
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:27.140]   He said you cannot bear any fruit.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:33.940]   Whatever fruit that you think you see, while you are not abiding in Christ, it is not a
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:36.840]   fruit from God.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.680]   It is not incomplete fruit.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.920]   It is not half-rotten fruit.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:48.720]   It is not fruit because you cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me because unless you
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.780]   abide in me, you can do nothing.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.540]   You know what that nothing includes?
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.100]   You know what that nothing includes?
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.820]   Raising your children.
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:07.420]   You cannot bear the fruit of the Holy Spirit unless we are abiding in Christ.
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.320]   I don't care how talented you are.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.620]   I don't care how gifted you are.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:12.060]   I don't care how old you are.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.340]   I don't care how experienced you are.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:16.420]   I don't care how wealthy you are.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:21.660]   Unless you're going to prove him wrong in this text, he makes it absolutely crystal
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.880]   clear.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:29.640]   You cannot bear fruit because the archegos of our salvation is Jesus Christ, and he was
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.660]   made perfect through the suffering.
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.820]   There is salvation in no other name but Jesus Christ.
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.700]   It is not in your education.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.180]   It is not in the economy.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.380]   It is not in the next president.
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:45.260]   There is no salvation in any other name but Jesus Christ.
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:49.780]   And that's why the conclusion of the book of Hebrews, we're many years away from that
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.020]   in Hebrews chapter 12.
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:57.020]   According to Harry, we're three years away.
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.840]   He was chapter 12.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:04.780]   In conclusion of all of this, he says, "Fix your eyes on Jesus, the author and the perfecter
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.780]   of faith."
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.700]   It doesn't say, "Look to Jesus."
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.260]   Some of the translation just says, "Look."
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.980]   It's not just looking.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.820]   Looking is just casually like you're just driving, just kind of like, you know.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:22.780]   That word that he uses here is like if you're watching the game seven finals, you know,
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:23.780]   and Kobe has the ball.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.860]   I know it's outdated, but Kobe has the ball, right?
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.340]   This last time we were relevant.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:38.620]   And clock is ticking down, and you're watching intently to see what's going to happen.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:45.060]   And then so when he makes that game-winning shot with the clock running down for the championship,
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:50.660]   everybody is celebrating at the same time because we all know what just happened.
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:55.460]   And people are going to be talking about that for years and decades to come.
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.860]   That's what he's describing in Hebrews chapter 12.
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:06.700]   Knowing all of that, knowing all of what he described about what he has done, fix your
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.460]   eyes upon Jesus.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:14.820]   Not just casually look at him, not just casually skim over the Bible, not just be a casual
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:17.460]   listener of the Word of God.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:22.700]   You know, you stay up till five in the morning every Saturday and then you kind of, you know,
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.100]   just stumble into church and then get it over with.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.380]   And so you can hang out with your friends.
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.940]   You're just kind of casual listeners of God's Word.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:34.660]   He says, "No," he says, "fix your eyes, commit to fix your eyes the author and perfecter
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:42.140]   of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despising the humiliation,
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:48.300]   the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.660]   Wow.
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:54.740]   I know just like any other human being, there are times we get busy with things and our
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.740]   hearts become callous and we drift.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:02.940]   I mean, that's a temptation of living in this world, especially in Orange County.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:07.860]   And that's why we're studying the book of Hebrews, to help us, to help us to get on
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.060]   track, help us to get focused.
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:20.060]   But man, when we come face to face to the Savior who saved us and the way he saved us
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:28.220]   and what he did to save us, how can we not break out in spontaneous praise?
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:32.260]   And you know the difference between praising God and singing songs.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.260]   You know the difference.
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:37.620]   Singing songs, you sing because it's time, because somebody's playing and the lights
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:44.060]   are on, and the words are up, and it's time for you to sing.
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.300]   Praise on the other hand, you can't help it.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.300]   You lose yourself.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:51.180]   It doesn't matter if other people are singing.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.140]   You know, "Oh, how come other people aren't raising their hand?"
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:58.060]   It doesn't matter because you're not even thinking about that because you can't help
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:59.460]   it.
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:05.060]   You can't help looking at Christ and what he has done.
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.340]   I want to share this song.
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:11.620]   You know, Nathan and Kat, yesterday at their wedding, they sang this song, and I prepared
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:12.620]   this before this.
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:13.620]   I'm not copying them.
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.060]   "As a Deer Panthers for the Water."
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:21.340]   I think I shared with you many times that this is probably my most favorite praise song.
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:27.860]   Years ago, I think it was the first or second time I was out in India, and early in the
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:33.500]   morning, couldn't sleep, I woke up around 4.30, and about 5 o'clock, the mosque nearby
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.460]   in the city of Bangalore, India, they have a call.
[00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.500]   If you've ever been to the Middle East and other parts of the world, the mosque would
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.700]   just blast.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.860]   I think they do this about four or five times a day, basically calling all Muslims, "It's
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:47.860]   time for you to pray."
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.340]   Five times a day.
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.700]   The first one starts at five in the morning.
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:54.220]   I woke up in the morning, and I was doing quiet time, and I was being blasted.
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:57.860]   It's like, "Oh my God, this is ruining my quiet time."
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:04.260]   Some of you guys may remember because I posted it up on Facebook.
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:10.060]   As this was blasting, I heard somebody downstairs playing this song, "As a Deer Panthers for
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:11.620]   the Water."
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:15.380]   My favorite hymn, favorite song.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:21.220]   It almost felt like God was giving me hope, that in this dark country, I have witnesses
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.220]   here.
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:28.060]   I remember, I was just ... It was my favorite song to begin with, but that made it even
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:32.260]   more precious, because now I have a context whenever I sing this song, "As a Deer Panthers
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:33.260]   for the Water."
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:36.460]   I don't know if Nathan chose this or Catherine chose this, and I was thinking yesterday,
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.660]   "Oh, this runs in the family."
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:45.340]   As the deer panteth for the water, so my soul longeth after thee.
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:50.380]   You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship thee.
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.460]   You alone are my strength, my shield.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:55.460]   To you alone may my spirit yield.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:00.820]   You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship thee.
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.500]   You're my friend, you're my brother, even though you are a king.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:09.380]   I love you more than any other, so much more than anything.
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.380]   You alone are my strength, my shield.
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.180]   You alone may my spirit yield.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:19.620]   You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship thee.
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.900]   Let's sing this song together, as our worship team comes and leads us.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:28.940]   Then as they lead us, as we sing, I invite you to take some time to pray, to make this
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.140]   song our true prayer.
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:40.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
