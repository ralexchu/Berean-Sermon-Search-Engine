[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12 verses 4 through 11.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.400]   We're going to be going warp speed today.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:20.640]   Okay, yeah, we're going to cover all the passages, all of it, 4 through 11.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.120]   Okay?
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:31.960]   So Hebrews chapter 12 verses 4 through 11.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.000]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.840]   You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.520]   and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.660]   My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.760]   by him.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.200]   For those whom the Lord loves, he disciplines, and he scourges every son whom he receives.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.080]   It is for discipline that you endure.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.360]   God deals with you as with sons.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.900]   For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.720]   But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.720]   children and not sons.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.440]   Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.600]   Shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits and live?
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.440]   For they disciplined us for a short time, as seemed best to them, but he disciplines
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.560]   us for our good, so that we may share his holiness.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.020]   All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful.
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.840]   Yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields a peaceful fruit of righteousness.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.840]   Let's pray.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.200]   Gracious Father, we pray for your grace.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.920]   We pray that your word would convict us, guide us, sanctify us.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.720]   That we may see a greater glimpse of your glory.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.280]   That we may change, we may be sanctified, we may be able to persevere through all the
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.380]   ups and downs, Lord God, of living in this fallen world.
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.560]   Help us to be reminded, Lord, that we are aliens and strangers just passing through,
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.600]   eagerly waiting and longing, Lord God, for the second coming of Christ.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.160]   So for that end, we pray for your blessing.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.160]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.160]   Amen.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160]   Amen.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   Amen.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.160]   Amen.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   Amen.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.560]   I'm sure many of you have been watching the news that there are UFOs in the world,
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.680]   okay?
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.200]   Or at least there's more attention given, right?
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   There's been speculations and pictures and stuff that's been around since we were kids,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   right?
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.400]   But recently with all the videos, and now especially the government fanning the flames
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.480]   that they're not absolutely certain anymore whether they can deny it.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.160]   And so there's been a lot of speculations.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.560]   Are aliens real, right?
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.520]   And all this space exploration, you know, a lot of that is, is there life there?
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.520]   Are there water?
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.520]   Is there oxygen?
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.200]   Are there enough things to sustain life?
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.240]   And so they've been studying this for many, many decades, but recently, obviously, it's
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.960]   come to the forefront and there's a lot of speculations and talking about it.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.240]   I've heard a lot of Christians talking about it.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.800]   What would it mean if there are actually aliens in this world?
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.500]   What if there was irrefutable proof that that was actually the case?
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.800]   How would that affect us?
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:26.920]   I've heard some people say recently, some Christians say that if aliens are real, that
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.400]   it would rock their faith.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.360]   I'm not sure exactly what they meant by that, but the way that it came across was that they
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.600]   would probably question their faith if that was true.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.680]   And it made me think, how would it affect you?
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.880]   Is this simple evidence of a UFO enough for you to say, you know what, everything that
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.380]   I believe was false?
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:57.520]   Is your faith so weak and tender that something as a speculation of maybe possibly intelligence
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.520]   outside of earth is enough for you to walk away from your faith?
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.840]   And if that's not the case, what would cause you to walk away from your faith?
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.120]   Maybe it's a loved one who gets cancer and say, you know what, God took him too early.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.040]   Or maybe a child who got sick and they left the earth too early.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.600]   What if maybe your business went bankrupt?
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.280]   What if your marriage fell apart or you're having difficulty or your child walks away?
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.760]   What would cause you to walk away from your faith, that you don't think that your faith
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.080]   is strong enough to be able to endure that?
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.140]   Whatever it is that you think may happen that's going to cause you to question your faith,
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.000]   it's probably at that very place where you are constantly being poked and attacked.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.160]   Because the Bible says that we have an enemy, the devil, like a roaring lion seeking someone
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.120]   to devour.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.200]   He's not devouring his own, he's not devouring the world, he's devouring people who follow
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.080]   Christ because his primary objective is to be the anti-Christ.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.640]   So anyone who exalts Christ, anyone who says they're a believer in Christ, is at that very
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.400]   place where you feel like that's your Achilles heel.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.200]   That's where your weakness is, is probably the place where you are constantly being poked.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.840]   If it's finance, if it is relationship, circumstance, peace, reputation, whatever it may be, that
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   may be the area where you are constantly being poked.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.240]   The book of Hebrews, the whole book is written to people who are just drifting.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.340]   They didn't decide to walk away from their faith.
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.960]   They weren't in danger of apostasy because something happened and said, "You know what?
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   I deny Christ."
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.800]   They were simply neglecting their faith and they were becoming tired.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:56.160]   Most people who walk away from their faith, it doesn't happen by choice, by at least not
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160]   clear choice.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.760]   They just become fatigued, tired, they get caught up with life, just like the third soil.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.960]   Concerns of paying bills, raising children, the difficulty in the trials of getting a
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.680]   job, dealing with coworkers, and trying to save enough money for retirement, and raising
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.160]   children, all of these things, it just fatigues you.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.240]   And then instead of paying attention, you just kind of allow things to happen.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.120]   And the natural course, natural flow of life is going to take you away from Christ.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.140]   Well the text that we're looking at in verse 4 begins by saying, "You have not yet resisted
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.960]   to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin."
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.560]   Now you can look at that and be challenged and say, "Yeah, you know, we need to strive
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.960]   harder."
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.320]   If you have energy and you already came into this room with some vitality, saying like,
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.160]   "Yeah, I want to do this," and this may be an encouragement to you, for a lot of you
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.560]   to read this passage, it's like, "Wow, I'm already tired as it is."
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.120]   And his encouragement to me is, "Well, you haven't shed blood yet, right?
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.040]   You haven't even shed blood yet, it's not time for you to quit."
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.680]   Again, you have to remember that the whole point of the book of Hebrews is really this.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.360]   The whole point of the book of Hebrews is to challenge people who are drifting away
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.160]   from Christ that it's not time for you to quit.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.680]   That you have no reason to quit, to continue to persevere.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.480]   And the reasoning that he gives is because you haven't shed blood yet.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.200]   In other words, you're not dead yet.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.520]   That's what he means, shedding blood.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.640]   Shedding blood isn't simply like, "Oh, you got cut."
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.120]   Shedding blood is another way of saying you have breath, you have life.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.960]   The reason why you have breath, you have life, is because somebody else shed blood for you.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.760]   And that was the point that he was trying to get at, right?
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.660]   The whole book of Hebrews.
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.440]   You have life because somebody else shed blood.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.320]   You still have life because he did it, so you have no reason to quit.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:01.840]   Because he's already bought your eternal life by his own sacrifice.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:08.160]   So therefore, his challenge is, no matter how fatigued, no matter how tired, how wearisome,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:15.080]   he says no Christian, if his faith is genuine, has a reason to quit.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:22.480]   I remember years ago when I was being discipled back in college, I was working probably about
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.880]   20 hours a week.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.720]   I was a super senior, so I was taking 22 units to finish school.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.960]   And then I was involved in ministry.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.160]   I was a part-time youth pastor.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.560]   And then I was heavily involved with the campus ministry, so I was probably giving about three
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.040]   or four sermons a week.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.960]   I was leading three small group Bible studies.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.760]   I had a 20-hour a week job.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.720]   And so I was just fatigued.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.520]   And I was in this apartment training, and so I was probably getting about three to four
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.800]   hours a day.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.640]   And I was just so dead tired.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.160]   But we had a rule in that apartment that no matter what time you slept, you have to get
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.760]   up at five in the morning.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.040]   And we'd have to go running and do quiet time together.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.240]   And after about a month and a half of doing this, I was so tired.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.680]   And I went to our trainer, and I remember asking him, like, I don't know if I can keep
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.920]   doing this, because I'm like...
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.800]   I would go to the library, and literally, I would just fall asleep at the table, fall
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.120]   asleep eating, fall asleep.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:20.320]   And then I remember every time I would go to him, his advice to me was, "Peter, expand
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   your capacity."
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:27.800]   Now, in a typical setting, I would have been angry, right?
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.120]   How much more can I stretch?
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.360]   I don't have any free time.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.360]   I have nothing.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.860]   And he said, "But Peter, everything you're doing is important.
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.860]   Expand your capacity."
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:43.320]   The reason why I took that to heart was because who that was telling me.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.460]   He had aging parents at that time.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.600]   He had a full-time job.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.200]   He was doing everything I was doing, and he was excellent, and he was running the apartment,
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.120]   and he was a youth pastor, and he had aging parents.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.680]   And he had a brother who was mentally challenged, so he was constantly going home to take care
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.760]   of his brother, and he did all of that excellently.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:10.280]   And so if that advice came from anybody else, I would say, "Who are you talking to?
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.160]   I'm sleeping four hours, so you want me to sleep two hours?"
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:19.040]   But I remember always coming out from that counseling challenged, because he was setting
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.800]   an example for me.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.160]   And to this day, it's stuck with me.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.280]   Expand your capacity.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:32.720]   Christ looks at our circumstance, and the advice now, he says, "You haven't to the point
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.720]   of shedding blood.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.920]   I shed blood for you to live.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.680]   Now you continue to persevere."
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:42.720]   Jeremiah 12, 5, it says, "If you have run with footmen, and they have tired you out,
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.440]   then how can you compete with horses?
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.000]   If you fall down in a land of peace, how will you do in the thicket of the Jordan?"
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.040]   In other words, God is fully in charge, and he's training us and building us up.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.640]   The text that we're looking at this morning, verses 4 through 11, the word "discipline"
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.320]   is used repeatedly over and over.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.440]   You need to persevere, because God is the one who is in charge of this discipline.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.480]   So when I say the word "discipline," some of you will have the idea of discipline as
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.720]   punishment immediately.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.420]   Maybe it's your upbringing.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.720]   Maybe it's your background.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.920]   Whenever we say "discipline," punishment.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.360]   God's going to punish you.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.320]   Some of you, when we use the word "discipline," maybe you like to work out.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.480]   Discipline means making a schedule, getting up at 6 in the morning, going out to work
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.240]   out, and not eating certain things, and doing certain things, saving up money.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.240]   Maybe in your mind, that's the first thing that gets triggered, discipline.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:42.020]   So discipline, the word, is being used in our English language in various ways.
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.440]   So we don't want to project what we think discipline is, what this is saying.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.440]   We want to make sure that we understand what He means by it, because the word He uses really
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.120]   is a word that encompasses all of that.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.880]   In fact, the word that is used is "pidea."
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:05.120]   Pidea, the root word, is the word "pious," and "pies" is the Greek word for "child."
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.640]   So when He uses the word "discipline" in this text, He's not simply talking about punishment,
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.560]   although that is part of it.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.520]   He's not only talking about training, although that's part of it.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:20.560]   It's basically He's describing a relationship where God makes us His adopted children, and
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.680]   He becomes our Abba Father.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:28.660]   Now in this relationship between Son and Father, that He's raising us up.
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.240]   And in raising us up, just like if you raise a child, there are times you have to discipline
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.160]   them for doing wrong.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160]   There are some times you need to discipline them so that they may be properly trained
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.240]   to do what is right.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.940]   But the word "discipline" is a broad term referring to that now that He has made us
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:51.320]   His children, so that we may live up to the calling that we have been given.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.320]   He hasn't just adopted us and said, "You know what?
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   Now you have life.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.320]   Just go enjoy it.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.320]   You're free.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.320]   You have Christian liberty.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.680]   Just do whatever you want."
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.160]   That's not what the Bible says.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.160]   Just like if you have children, or if you adopted a child into your home, you don't
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.960]   just adopt them, make sure that's on legal paper, and then you just kind of let them
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.680]   be.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.840]   Part of the adoption, the reason why they go through all that process is they want
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.960]   to know that if you're going to be a good parent.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.680]   They want to know if you have the means to take care of them.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.000]   They want to know if you're psychologically, physically able to take care.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.920]   And that's why you have to get reference letters.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.160]   Are you part of a good community?
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.480]   What kind of reputation do you have?
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.880]   Because they want to know if you are a fit father or mother.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.640]   And so this word that is being used here to talk about God's discipline is basically
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.640]   talking about God's parenting.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.640]   How does God parent us?
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:52.920]   And so it's in that context that this text describes, and I put it in three parts.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   To understand the perspective of how God deals with us as his children, three things.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.560]   One, God's discipline is perfect.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.360]   That's the first point that I want to make.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.360]   The second thing that this text teaches us is that God's discipline is proof of our
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.640]   sonship and his love for us.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.640]   It's proof.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.320]   Third, God's discipline is for our own training, for our own good.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.800]   That's the exact words that is used here, for our training.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.480]   So one, God's discipline is perfect.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.760]   Second, God's discipline is proof of our sonship and his love for us.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:33.400]   Third, God's discipline is for our training.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:38.840]   In this text, firstly it says God disciplines us perfectly.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:45.520]   Verse five, "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.320]   you are reproved by him."
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:56.400]   In other words, there's two ways that an individual can wrongly accept or respond to God's discipline.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.760]   One to take it lightly.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.980]   Kind of like, whatever happens, happens.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:08.240]   This is an individual who really doesn't see sin as that horrible.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:13.400]   I remember, I think this week, and I was listening to Piper, and John Piper made a very clear
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:18.960]   distinction between confession and repentance.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.260]   Somebody who is constantly taking lightly their sin is somebody who is in the habit
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.560]   of confessing but never repenting.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.940]   The difference is repentance basically means not only to acknowledge your sin, but to turn
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.040]   away from your sin.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.880]   But somebody who is constantly confessing is an individual who feels guilty.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.560]   And the only thing that he's concerned about is that he gets out of his guilt.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.200]   It's like, oh, once saved, always saved.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   God forgives me.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.200]   He loves me unconditionally.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.620]   And then you confess it.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:52.240]   And you get it off your chest, and then you cling to verses where God's, your sins are
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.540]   forgiven, and then you move on, and then this cycle repeats over and over again.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:01.160]   Never repenting, always confessing.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:06.160]   This is an individual who takes the Lord's discipline lightly.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.240]   Think about this pandemic.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.120]   The whole world was shut down.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.880]   And an individual who kind of looks at the circumstance and says, you know what, years
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.960]   later you're going to tell your children or grandchildren about how difficult it was
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.080]   because it was shut down for a year, and you couldn't hang out with your friends to get
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.480]   boba when you wanted.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.720]   So you look at it, it was inconvenient.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.160]   There's no deep thought into it.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.380]   There's a why did God do this?
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.960]   What opportunities are made?
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.520]   It's just inconvenienced.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.880]   And so circumstances and trials and difficulties come into our life, and you just kind of brush
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.880]   it off.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.120]   I'm just going to move on.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.900]   What's the big deal?
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:53.960]   He says, do not take the Lord's discipline lightly, meaning the Lord has a purpose for
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.960]   this.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.080]   There's a purpose.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.380]   There's something for us to learn.
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.640]   There's a reason behind it.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.000]   And that's why he says, do not take it lightly.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.400]   The other end of that, he says, do not faint.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.460]   Discouraged to the point where you don't want to do this anymore.
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.000]   How many people have you met that because they were discouraged at this point, and somebody
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.280]   let them down, and said, I love God, but I don't love the church.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.120]   They become faint.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:27.320]   And the reason why they become faint is because they don't see God's hand in it.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:32.540]   Or if they see God's hand in it, they don't believe in a loving God.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.080]   So therefore, they become faint.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.760]   One of the most common questions that I get from people, especially if you've been alive
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:48.520]   for a while, is like, how do I trust people when they've wronged me in the past?
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:54.700]   I've had this, and I've heard some horrible things that have happened to people way before
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.860]   they've come to church.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:02.740]   And the wrestling mask is, I don't know how I can ever trust anybody considering what
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.940]   they've done to me.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.300]   Here's the good news and bad news.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:12.340]   The bad news is, you can't just turn that off.
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.820]   It'd be insensitive for me to say, hey, suck it up and move on.
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.580]   I mean, considering the horrible things that have happened.
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:24.000]   Good news is, God didn't call us to trust them.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.720]   God called us to love them.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.060]   God didn't call us to trust them.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.420]   God called us to love them.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:37.020]   It doesn't require trust for us to love.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:44.020]   See, when we become faint, part of that reason is because we don't see a sovereign God who
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:48.100]   loves us, who've allowed this situation to happen.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:53.420]   You know, as parents, that's our constant fear, right?
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.820]   Did we do too much?
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.760]   Did we not do enough?
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.500]   So when we're disciplining our children, you know, years back we look at it and say, oh,
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.140]   maybe I should have been more patient with them.
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:08.180]   Or maybe in that particular situation, I should have been more harsh with them.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.700]   That I should have squeezed harder, or maybe I shouldn't have squeezed so hard, because
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.940]   our constant fear is that if we squeeze too hard, we're going to discourage them, and
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.560]   they're going to lose heart.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.540]   But if we don't discipline them enough, they're going to get spoiled, and they don't think
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.700]   this is important.
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:31.300]   So there's a constant balancing act that parents do to make sure that we're doing what is necessary.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.820]   Well our God does not have that problem, because God is all-knowing.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.340]   He knows our heart.
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.880]   He is all-knowing, and He is all good.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:44.980]   So therefore, even though we can't connect the dots, the Bible says that our God disciplines
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.520]   us perfectly.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.540]   That's why we don't take it lightly, nor do we faint, because whatever it is that God
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:57.900]   has placed us in, He's doing it in His perfect knowledge, in His perfect love, in His perfect
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.020]   will.
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:05.060]   In Psalm 42, 5-6, it says, "Why are you in despair, O my soul?
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.460]   And why have you become disturbed within me?
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.980]   Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him for the help of His presence."
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.620]   Oh, oh my God, my soul is in despair within me.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.700]   "Therefore, I remember you from the land of the Jordan and the peaks of Hermon, from
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.780]   Mount Mizar."
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.100]   Today we're going to be participating in the communion, right?
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:29.140]   All of you guys have this communion wafer and thingy that we have, right?
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.100]   And hopefully we don't have to do this for long.
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.700]   But the reason why God gave us this communion is for this reason, because He knows that
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:41.580]   you and I have a tendency to look at circumstances through our physical eyes.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.940]   That all that we have, we walk by what we see, not by faith, because that's our natural
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.900]   tendency.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:54.780]   So the communion is given to the church to constantly remind us to look to Him.
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.100]   That do you believe in a God who loved you enough to send His only begotten Son?
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.540]   How will He not, along with Him?
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.700]   If He gave His only begotten Son, along with Him, give us all things.
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:13.360]   If He gave His only begotten Son, why would He withhold any good thing from us?
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:19.280]   And that's what the communion table really is, is to recalibrate our thoughts, our focus.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:25.100]   So that in the midst of trials, in the midst of raising children and busyness of life,
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:29.280]   that we would look to Christ, that we would look to God, who is completely sovereign and
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.260]   completely loving.
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:38.200]   In 1 Corinthians 10, 13, it says, "No temptation has overtaken you, but such as is common to
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.200]   man.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.680]   And God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.960]   with the temptation will provide the way of escape so that you will be able to endure
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   it."
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.800]   That no matter what circumstance that you're in, past, present, or future, God is completely
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.480]   sovereign.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.040]   You remember the story of Job?
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:06.640]   His whole suffering was initiated because Satan challenged God and said, "Your child
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.400]   that you say is righteous is only righteous because you've been protecting him.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.680]   Let me add him.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:17.520]   Take away your hedge of protection and see if he praises you after I'm done."
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.240]   That's the beginning of the book of Job.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:24.280]   So all of his suffering was initiated by Satan saying, "Let me at him.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.740]   Stop protecting him.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.740]   Let me go at him."
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.340]   And God says, "Okay."
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.280]   And then you see the cycle of pain and suffering.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.960]   Anything that you can possibly think of, financial hardship, losing his children, personal health
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:46.720]   goes out, his reputation of righteousness being challenged, his closest friends coming
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   and saying, "You must have done something wrong."
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.760]   There's no part of his life where he's not touched.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.720]   Any one of those things would cause an average man to crumble.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:05.320]   Every part of his life, his reputation, his family life, health, wealth, everything, most
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.960]   things that people would fear, all of that happens to him in his life.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:15.400]   And yet Satan's name is never mentioned after the beginning.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.760]   All of it is, "God is doing this to you."
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.760]   God is.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.760]   Why is God doing this to you?
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.400]   And even at the end, God doesn't show up and say, "It wasn't me.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   I didn't do that.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.400]   Satan did it.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.720]   Don't blame me."
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.720]   No.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:35.680]   God takes ownership because that only happened because God allowed it to happen.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.400]   Same thing happens in the New Covenant.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.000]   Before Jesus goes to the cross, remember what Jesus says?
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.760]   Satan has asked permission to sift you like wheat.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.880]   He has permission.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.360]   He didn't gather up an army to challenge God.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.680]   He has permission.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:24:00.800]   Even satanic work was under God's sovereign plan, and he allowed it to happen.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.160]   So when he says, "No temptation has seized you, but what is common to man, but God is
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.680]   faithful and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able."
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:15.760]   In other words, that even in your trials and temptations, God has us in his arms.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.600]   And what God does, he does perfectly.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:25.920]   And therefore, that's why he says, "You have no reason to quit because you're not the one
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.120]   fighting alone."
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.320]   Everything that he does, no matter what circumstance, no matter what has happened to you in the
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:38.080]   past, no matter how horrible that memory is, no matter how hard of a time we have connecting
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:42.340]   the dots, God was sovereign.
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:46.520]   No matter what circumstance you are in now, no matter what hardship and struggle, no matter
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:54.440]   what relational problems and hurt and pain that you hold onto today, God is sovereign.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:01.200]   And no matter what you may face, your greatest fear may happen tomorrow, the answer is God
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.160]   is sovereign.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:10.340]   The God who is perfectly sovereign, perfectly knowing, who loves us like his own child,
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.720]   he is completely sovereign.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.620]   And that's why he says not to take it lightly.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:20.320]   Don't brush it off like, "Yeah, that's not going to bother me."
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.520]   Or don't become faint.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.660]   Because whatever God is doing, he does perfectly.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:31.160]   That's number one, to understand that God's discipline is perfect.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:37.080]   Two, God's discipline is proof of sonship and love.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.560]   He says in verse 7, "It is for discipline that you endure.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.120]   God deals with you as with sons.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.300]   For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.660]   But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.660]   children and not sons."
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:56.660]   So if you say you're a follower of Christ and you have no hardship in life, he says
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.720]   maybe you're illegitimate.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.220]   If God genuinely loves you, hardship will come.
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.660]   He said, "If you follow me, they hated me, so they're going to hate you.
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:11.780]   If there's any reflection of myself in you, the world is not going to be happy with you."
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:18.860]   I mean, the problem that we have in our generation is we want to be cool in the kingdom and in
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.100]   the world at the same time.
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.940]   And we want to attract the world so that they can come into the church and have a smooth
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:33.340]   transition from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:39.660]   And somehow, people have convinced themselves that this is possible.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.660]   That you've gotten accustomed to darkness and somehow you're going to come into light
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.620]   and there's going to be no shock whatsoever.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.380]   There's going to be a smooth transition.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:52.020]   There's going to be no difference between a non-Christian sitting and hearing the word
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.820]   of God and a Christian hearing the word of God.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.540]   So we need to make it as dim as possible.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.260]   We can barely see.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:03.660]   And so people whose eyes haven't adjusted to the light can also feel comfortable here.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.100]   He said, "If there is no discipline, that may be evidence that you're illegitimate children,"
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.100]   he says.
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.140]   "Therefore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them.
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:16.820]   Shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits and live for they disciplined
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:17.820]   for a short time?"
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:23.220]   In other words, it was common grace given to us temporarily as seemed what was best
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.220]   to them.
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.340]   In other words, they're sinners too.
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.620]   They did what they thought was best, but they're sinners.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:37.660]   So therefore, whatever discipline we receive, even though it was for our own good, was never
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.420]   perfect.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:47.740]   But he disciplines us for good so that we may share his holiness.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:55.660]   Discipline for God's children is evidence of our sonship, is evidence ultimately of
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.580]   his love.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:03.820]   We think that maybe the opposite of love is hatred.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.200]   And you can make an argument for that.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.100]   You could make an argument, make a point of that.
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:15.180]   But when we disobey to love, it's usually not hatred.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.260]   When God says to love, "And the world will know that you are disciples of mine if you
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.460]   love as I have loved you," as Jesus said, "then the world will know you are my disciples."
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.320]   And then we choose to reject that.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.460]   We don't go out hating the world.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.460]   I hate you.
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.900]   I'm not going to obey Jesus, so I hate the world.
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.340]   That's not usually how it's expressed.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:39.580]   When we disobey love, usually we disobey with indifference.
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.940]   Indifference.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:48.860]   Because getting dirty is uncomfortable with us.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.860]   I have enough problems.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.220]   I don't want to stress over your problems.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.220]   So typically, it's indifference.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:29:01.180]   I remember years ago, I had a pastor friend who came and told me, "You know, I think the
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:07.660]   biggest problem in our generation in churches today is that we don't practice church discipline.
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:12.380]   And so we allow sin to be rampant and do whatever they want, and that's our biggest problem.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:16.780]   So we need to bring church discipline back."
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.380]   I agreed and disagreed.
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.620]   I agreed that sin should be taken seriously.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.300]   I agree, because the Bible clearly teaches us to practice church discipline.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:32.480]   But the reason behind that is not what you think.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:38.560]   The reason why the church generally does not practice church discipline is because of lack
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.620]   of love.
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:49.740]   Because if the people who are going astray was your brother or sister, father or mother,
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:58.100]   your daughter or son, you would not stay silent because you love them.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:04.100]   Even if they resent you for a period, you are more concerned about the harm that they
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:10.940]   are doing to themselves than what they may say to you, because your love will supersede
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.460]   whatever discomfort that you may feel.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:23.500]   Part of the reason why we are cautious and we stay away is really because we're indifferent.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.900]   Don't be confused with practicing grace.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.480]   That's not grace.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.220]   Allowing a child who's running toward harm and saying nothing isn't grace.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.220]   That's not loving.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.220]   That's not being gentle.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.980]   You're saying, "I believe you're going to crash and burn.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.900]   I'm just going to let you be, because I'm loving."
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.420]   No.
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.100]   That's indifference.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.460]   That's the opposite of love.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:52.860]   Part of the reason why sin is not taken seriously, why we don't confront each other in truth,
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:58.900]   in love, is because we are not practicing the biblical love that He preaches.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.820]   God did not leave us alone in our sins.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.840]   He engaged us.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.540]   He continues to engage us.
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.780]   Think about the nation of Israel.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:15.580]   You think about the nation of Israel and would say, you know, you read the Old Testament
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.980]   and God seems so harsh.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.860]   He's constantly sending prophets, telling Hosea to marry Gomer, a prostitute.
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.380]   It's like, "Why would you do that?"
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.260]   Just to tell them, "This is how hideous your sin is."
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.380]   You read the Old Testament, it's like, "Oh, God is a God of judgment."
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:31.820]   The Old Testament becomes the New Testament.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:35.780]   It says, "God so loved the world that He only begotten Son.
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.740]   He demonstrated His own love while we were yet sinners.
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.740]   He died for us."
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.220]   So the God of the New Testament seems like a loving God.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:46.420]   God of the Old Testament seems like He's a judgmental, vengeful God.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:51.300]   But the only reason why He's sending these prophets to warn them is because He loves
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.460]   them.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:58.900]   If He was done with them, we wouldn't have the Old Testament.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:03.620]   There wouldn't be this drama of sending His prophets and warning them to turn from their
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:09.660]   sins because all He had to do was, "Go, I'm done with you.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.460]   I'm done."
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:16.100]   What would it take for Him to wipe out the earth?
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.060]   It says in six days He created the earth.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.420]   I'm sure destroying is a lot easier than creating.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.220]   Building takes time.
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:28.260]   Destroying could, one day, you can bring those buildings down in one day.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.740]   Boom, it's gone.
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.740]   The only reason why He sends His prophets to warn them, to discipline them, and why
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.740]   He perseveres with them is because He still loves them.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:43.500]   He says discipline is a proof of His love.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.500]   Same thing in the Old Testament.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.180]   I mentioned that in the book of Revelation.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:51.220]   Why this whole drama at the end with seven judgments?
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.340]   The seal judgment, trumpet judgment, the bowl judgment.
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.900]   Why all of this judgment?
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:02.860]   Because God is pleading with the sinful world before judgment comes to turn and to repent.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:09.260]   So He says, "If you are truly His children, He will discipline you."
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.020]   God's discipline is proof of sonship and His love toward us.
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.700]   Third and finally, God's discipline is for our training.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.500]   It's for our own good.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.980]   Discipline is hard to take when we don't understand what it is.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:31.620]   Discipline is hard to take when we don't understand what it's for.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:39.260]   I can remember probably the most pain that I've ever experienced, a physical pain, was
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.500]   at the hospital.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.860]   I've broken my ankles, my arms.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.220]   There's an immediate pain that comes, but like prolonged pain.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.460]   I remember, I think I was about eighth grade.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:55.500]   Our family never went to the dentist, like ever.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.500]   We're immigrant families.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.300]   We didn't have insurance, so everything that cost so much money.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:04.260]   So my teeth, if you look at my third grade picture, there's more cavities than I had
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.380]   regular teeth.
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:11.900]   I went and basically I had like 20 some cavities that I needed to work on.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:16.100]   I remember listening very carefully at my mom trying to get a discount.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.940]   Even as an eighth grader, it's like, "Please don't get the discount.
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.700]   I need the full work."
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:21.700]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.260]   I don't want discount teeth work.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:27.820]   I remember I just dread.
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.860]   It was like four Saturdays or something that we're going.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.660]   Each time I went, it was excruciatingly painful.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.660]   I don't know if the Novocaine or whatever they were putting in my mouth just wasn't
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.820]   working, especially my front teeth.
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.900]   I remember they were drilling inside of it for 30, 40 minutes.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.860]   I felt like I felt every single bit of that.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:50.940]   I was pinching my thigh just to take away from this pain that maybe this pain will distract
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.940]   from this pain.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.940]   But I endured through that.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.500]   I didn't jump out of the seat and say, "What are you doing?"
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.300]   Because I knew it was for my own good.
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.700]   I had to fix my teeth.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:07.260]   But when you don't understand what the pain is for, you don't understand who is doing
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:12.220]   it and why it's happening, it is very difficult to endure.
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.500]   Pain just becomes pain.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:20.180]   But what he's trying to say is that a God who practices perfect discipline, and he's
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:27.660]   doing it because he loves us, has a specific purpose for our own good, for our own training.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:33.220]   And that's why he's saying no matter how hard things get, he's telling the Hebrews that
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:37.740]   you're drifting away because all you're seeing is the difficulty, not recognizing who it
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.700]   is that is allowing this to happen.
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:44.180]   And that's why he's saying to fix your eyes on Jesus.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.700]   He's in control of this.
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.860]   Satan is not roaming around outside of his care.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:56.300]   So whatever pain that you may have experienced in the past, present, or even in the future,
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:01.140]   God who doesn't make mistakes, who loves us to the point that he would send his only begotten
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:07.500]   son for us, has a purpose to equip us and to train us.
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.540]   James chapter 1, 2-4, consider joy.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.100]   Consider it all joy.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:17.820]   My brethren, when you encounter various trials, consider it pure joy.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.100]   You know, some people look at this passage and think that if you're a good Christian
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.780]   that you should always have a smile on your face, right?
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:29.300]   Even in the midst of excruciatingly painful things that happen in life, because you want
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.820]   people to know, "Ah, nothing bothers me."
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:36.100]   And you got this fake smile, fake, you know.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.140]   He's not saying like, "Act silly."
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.140]   It's like, "I'm a good Christian.
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.380]   I love Jesus."
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.900]   Even Jesus, as he was facing the cross, was agonizing before God.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:46.900]   Is there another way?
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.900]   Because that's a natural human response.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:54.080]   That's why it says in verse 11, "All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful."
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:00.340]   So the fact that it is hard, the fact that it is not pleasant, is natural.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:06.100]   But when he says, "Consider it joy," he's saying, "Think, consider, and calculate."
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:11.180]   When you're putting it in your ledger between positive and negative, when you look at it
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:15.140]   from the perspective of eternality within the hands of a sovereign God who loves us,
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:19.660]   who doesn't make mistakes, consider it, think of it, pure joy, when you encounter
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:24.540]   trials of various kinds, knowing that you're testing up your faith produces endurance.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.540]   Endurance.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:30.340]   He said that's the point that he's trying to get us to, right?
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:34.020]   To endure, to persevere, to not quit, right?
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.700]   That's what endurance means.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:43.880]   Our natural instinct is, when hardship comes, is to get rid of that hardship, right?
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.300]   Avoid the circumstance.
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.400]   If it's coming from people, avoid those people.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:55.300]   If it's, whatever it is happening, I don't like it there, it's uncomfortable, and so
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.580]   I'm going to change.
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.940]   So we keep people at bay.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:04.820]   We can switch churches, change friends.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:09.540]   Whatever it is, our natural instinct is, when we're uncomfortable, to change because we
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.420]   don't want to be there.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:17.260]   But he says when the testing of your faith comes, in order to produce endurance, and
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:23.360]   when endurance happens perfectly, when you continue to endure, this is not saying that
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.140]   there is no good time to ever change anything.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:31.740]   There's times when false doctrines are being taught, when there's apostasy happening.
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.740]   There are times when we need to cut ties.
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.620]   Our unity is in unity with Christ.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:42.820]   But he's saying this, if our natural instinct is, every difficult circumstance, our immediate
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:46.820]   thought is, God doesn't want me to be uncomfortable, and so I need to change this, change this
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.980]   relationship, change this and that.
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:49.980]   He says no.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:55.780]   He said consider pure joy because it produces endurance, and when you continue on the right
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:01.380]   path, you will have perfect results so that you may be perfect, complete, lacking in nothing.
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:05.140]   Perfect meaning God's intended purpose of your suffering.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:10.820]   That if you continue, that's why an individual who's constantly switching from one uncomfortable
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:15.380]   situation until you get to another comfortable situation, until that becomes uncomfortable,
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:20.300]   and then you go somewhere else, and then that becomes uncomfortable, is that you never produce
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.220]   the result that God desires.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:26.780]   Because what God desires requires perseverance.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.880]   It's like raising a child.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.700]   You don't snap a finger and read them a bedtime story of the rules that you're supposed to
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.460]   follow and your parenting is done.
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.020]   It requires years.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:42.700]   Those of you who are potty training your children, did you just tell them, show them a picture
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.100]   and show them a video and then walk away?
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.100]   No.
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.860]   They have to, you have to persevere, right?
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.340]   Seem like they got it right, and then the next thing you wake up in the morning, you
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:57.100]   see a puddle of pee on the ground, it's like, oh my gosh.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.780]   But you didn't quit on them.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:05.620]   It required, even something simple as potty training required perseverance.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:10.580]   So if God is raising us as children, maybe some of us are being potty trained right now.
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.500]   Spiritual potty training, because you keep peeing everywhere.
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:14.780]   Maybe.
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.820]   Maybe some of you really smell.
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:25.100]   He says you need to persevere in the right direction because God is raising us up.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:30.980]   He says to consider purity because God's perfect loving hand is trying to teach you something
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.060]   and when you persevere in it, you will be complete lacking in nothing.
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.940]   In Romans chapter 5, 3 to 5.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:39.500]   And not only this, but we also exalt in our tribulations knowing that the tribulation
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.300]   brings about what?
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.500]   Perseverance.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:48.300]   Again, what is the primary thing that he says that happens when tribulation comes?
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.300]   You learn to persevere.
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.620]   Persevere.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:57.500]   Go through trials and endure through suffering because when you endure through suffering,
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.940]   you have proven character.
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:07.100]   Now especially for the younger people in our generation, we have a tendency to think that
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:14.940]   character comes from being famous on TikTok or your character comes from being successful
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:18.780]   at something or getting a lot of attention.
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:22.340]   Character is not something that you get from reading a book.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:26.240]   Character is not something you get because you're successful in business.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.460]   Character is not something you get because you made a few right decisions.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:37.420]   He says character comes from perseverance, doing hard things and enduring through it.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.820]   That's what he says.
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:46.580]   He says when you have proven character, hope and hope does not disappoint because the love
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:52.620]   of God has been poured out within our hearts though the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:42:00.540]   Love causes us to persevere which develops character and character is what we have hope
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.660]   in.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:06.260]   Character basically is proven faith.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.220]   We've been trained to look to Christ and not to the world.
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:12.620]   We've been trained to run to Christ and our comfort come from him and not to the world,
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.460]   not to any worldly means.
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:18.340]   That's how the Bible describes character.
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.580]   So in everything that we do in life, we have some kind of training.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:26.820]   Like I said, if you're a child, you're trained, potty trained.
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.820]   Like pastors, we go to seminary and we get trained.
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.300]   We get trained meaning how to study the Bible.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:37.660]   I would say 90% of what I do at church, I was not taught in seminary.
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.060]   They don't teach you.
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:44.260]   I remember the first baptism that I did, I had no idea what I was doing.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:48.700]   I just remember what my older friends did and I just copied it.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.100]   And then when they told me, "Why did you do that?"
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.820]   I said, "I don't know."
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.980]   They did it.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.180]   So it took me a while to figure out why am I doing it this way?
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.180]   Same thing with communion.
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.180]   Why am I doing this?
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.260]   So it kind of forced me to kind of question everything that we're doing at church.
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.260]   Oh, this is what we're doing.
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.260]   Oh, this is what we're doing.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:12.940]   And I realized so many things that I was doing, I just did it because that's just what I saw.
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:15.860]   But everything that we do, we have some kind of training.
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:23.860]   But the true training does not happen in classrooms.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:24.980]   It doesn't happen in classrooms.
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:29.120]   That's why when you go look for a job, it's good that you have training, meaning that
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.540]   you were taught in a classroom.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.300]   But usually what do they look for?
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.060]   Experience.
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:39.760]   Because what they really value more than your education is do you actually know how to do
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.940]   this?
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.180]   Not do you have a degree?
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:47.140]   I remember years ago when I was younger, I was like 19 or 20, I got a job at Hughes Aircraft
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.140]   as a janitor.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.380]   And I know I shared this before.
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:55.020]   And for eight hours a day, I had to clean trash can and vacuum.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:59.000]   And it was in semi-darkness because I had to go to the other side of the building to
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   turn on the light.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.540]   There was just enough light so that I wouldn't have to waste time, go to the other end.
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:09.280]   So eight hours a day by myself with no human contact, I was picking up trash and cleaning
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.940]   up, doing vacuum.
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:15.660]   And I remember about a month and a half to two months into it, I started hearing my own
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:16.660]   voice.
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.460]   Because it's just no human contact, zero.
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:22.060]   This is before cell phones, the internet, there's nothing.
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.940]   So basically once you go to work, it's just dead silence, dim light, and just throwing
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:26.940]   away trash.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:31.540]   And I remember carrying the trash out with my both hands to the dumpster, and I started
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:32.540]   talking to myself.
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:33.540]   What?
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.540]   What did he say?
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:35.540]   What?
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:40.220]   And then I caught myself talking like, what are you doing?
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.220]   You're crazy.
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.500]   And I said, oh, this is what happens to people who are isolated for a long period of time.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:51.140]   Because I had no human contact at night, and then during the day I attended class by myself.
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:54.040]   And so I had literally no human contact.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.300]   So I asked my boss, I don't think I can do this anymore.
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.580]   I'm going to go crazy.
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:03.940]   I'm not going to be able to distinguish between the real voice and fake voice.
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:07.500]   So he said, well, the only other position we have open is the guy who was cleaning the
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.500]   toilets, he quit.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.500]   And I said, where is it?
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.500]   He said, oh, it's in the other building.
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.340]   And that's where all the nighttime workers were hanging out.
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.580]   So I said, oh, that's got to be better than this.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.300]   So I said, OK, I'll take it.
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.500]   So I walked in, and they had about 23 different toilets.
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.500]   It's a huge building.
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.060]   It was a huge aircraft in Fullerton.
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:30.780]   So my job was to walk around from 5 to 2 in the morning to clean up all the bathrooms.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:36.040]   And I got so many stories from this period of my life, which I won't get into today.
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:43.260]   But I remember the first time doing the job, he said, oh, this couple who was doing this,
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.260]   they're going to train you.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:51.500]   And I remember when they were training me, they just would tackle the toilet with bare
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.700]   hands.
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:56.220]   They'd take the brush, and then they would wipe it down.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.680]   And I said, really?
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.680]   And then they looked at me.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.680]   It's like, oh, OK, OK.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.700]   So here's what you're supposed to do.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.960]   So they opened up their cart.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.260]   And in the cart, they had this huge apron, rubber apron, the kind that they had at the
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:13.660]   butcher, where every part of them is protected.
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:18.500]   So they had this rubber apron that comes from the neck all the way down to the floor.
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.720]   So it covers your whole body.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:25.540]   And then they had a glove that comes all the way beyond your elbow, both of them.
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:29.220]   And then you wear a mask, and then you have a hood.
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:34.780]   So basically, if anything splatters, the only part that's not protected are your eyes.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:35.780]   So you wear glasses.
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:38.500]   So I said, OK, all right, I can do this.
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.320]   This is better than being in darkness all night.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.180]   So I did it.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:47.500]   And then even the brush isn't that typical, like a foot and a half brush.
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.500]   This is like three feet.
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:49.940]   You know what I mean?
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.140]   So I can get to the toilet from a distance.
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:56.500]   So if it splashed, I have enough time to jump out of the way.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:02.220]   So the first two to three weeks, I did exactly what they told me to do, or thought, oh, this
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:06.100]   is how to protect yourself from this junk.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.660]   So I would go into the bathrooms.
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.220]   And again, I learned so many things.
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:14.420]   I won't get into it today.
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:19.860]   I'm so tempted to tell you.
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.980]   One of these days-- OK, maybe at the retreat, when we have more time.
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:28.540]   I learned so many things about different cultures through their bowel movements.
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:33.580]   Anyway, has nothing to do with this sermon, so I'm not going to sidetrack.
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:37.380]   So after about a week and a half of this, it's like, I can't do this, because it would
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:38.380]   take forever.
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:43.860]   And then every time I need to take a break, I got to hose down, take all things off, wash
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:44.860]   my hand.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.860]   And then I got to go take a break.
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.580]   And then five minutes later, I got to come back, put it all back on.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.380]   And so every bathroom was a chore.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.380]   I was like, I can't reach.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.740]   And there's a spot underneath.
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.340]   I can't get to it.
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:57.540]   So every day, something was coming off.
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.940]   I can't wear this hat.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.940]   It's too hot in here.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.740]   And I gave the brush-- I can't reach this with a brush.
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.140]   I get this shorter one.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.740]   Then after, oh, this-- I can't bend with this apron on.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.180]   It's like, ah, I can't take this off.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:15.260]   Eventually, I took everything off, and I was doing exactly what they were doing, because
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:21.020]   I was able to do it half the time and do it much faster and effectively, because I wasn't
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.860]   concerned about getting dirty.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:27.100]   Obviously, I'd have to go home and take a shower and clean myself.
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:32.620]   But if I wanted to do this job effectively, I had to do what they're doing.
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:37.060]   What does this have to do with the sermon?
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:41.740]   There's so much training that you can get in the classroom, because you're hearing and
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:46.140]   people are telling you, this is what you're supposed to do.
[00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:49.340]   You're willing to get dirty.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.860]   You're never really going to learn.
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:59.300]   If our natural inclination is, you see sin in other people, you see sin in circumstance,
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:03.700]   you see difficulty, and our natural instinct is to put on the full garb or just stay away
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:09.180]   from that, your training is always in theory.
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:11.140]   You don't really know how to disciple.
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.460]   You don't really know how to love.
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:18.480]   You don't really know how to persevere, because it's all in theory.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:27.800]   It isn't until we are willing to get dirty, just like Christ came and took on humanity
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:36.460]   and walked among the dirt with us, that he was able to sympathize with our weaknesses.
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:45.380]   God is working to train us to walk in the same shoes that he walked in, to be in the
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:46.900]   midst of sinners.
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:51.100]   If you're in the midst of sinners, you're going to have some of that stuff splash on
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:54.380]   you.
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:57.300]   God is doing that to train us.
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:03.020]   That's why he said, "If you want to come after me, you take up the cross too, and you deny
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.480]   yourself and follow me."
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:11.940]   In God's perfect plan, he allows certain things to happen in our lives.
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:18.940]   A God who is perfect, a God who loves us, has a specific reason why he placed you and
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:22.580]   allow you to experience what you are experiencing now.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:28.900]   My prayers at this morning as we participate in this communion, to recognize maybe we are
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:34.220]   looking at our physical circumstance and our past through our own physical lens, but this
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:41.140]   morning that we would look at it through the lens of Christ who was crucified on our behalf.
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:43.500]   And it changes everything.
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:50.140]   If you believe that a loving, perfect, sovereign God is the one who placed us where we're at,
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.420]   it changes everything.
