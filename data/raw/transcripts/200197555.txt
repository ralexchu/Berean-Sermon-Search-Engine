[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Galatians 4.4.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Okay, Alex.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   We're going to read just one verse and then we're going to jump in.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Okay.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   I know all of you guys have a very busy schedule,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   but again, I can't think of a better way to celebrate Christmas
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   than to come and give worship to the man who is the birthday that we celebrate.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   So, Galatians 4.4.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   "But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   born of a woman, born unto the law."
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Let's pray.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for blessing our families,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   blessing our church.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   We thank you for your grace.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   We thank you, Lord God, for constantly sustaining and answering our prayers
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   in all things.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Especially today as we remember Christ's sacrifice
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   and him humbling himself and taking on human form,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   that he may come and save sinners like us.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   We pray that as we celebrate in the busyness of the holidays,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   help us, Lord God, to reflect deeply upon the sacrifice that you've made.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And again, not just simply for us, but for many Christians around the world,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   especially those brothers and sisters who are living in places with heavy persecution.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I pray, Father God, that you give them extra strength, extra faith, Lord God,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   to sustain them, that their love for you would only grow stronger
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   as a result of all that's going on.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   We pray, especially for our Sunday school teachers and our children,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   that you would allow us, Lord, not just for our generation,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   but for the next generation, for many generations to come,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   that we would truly be lovers of Christ in all things.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   So help us, Lord, that all that we do may establish your grace and blessing
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   for them and for many years to come.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   So we thank you in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   All right, so the passage that I read, I'm going to be jumping from text to text
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   in various passages, but in Galatians 4.4, it says, Paul says,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   "When the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   born of a woman, born under the law."
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Paul describes basically Christmas and Jesus' ministry and his time on earth
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   as the fullness of time, meaning that it was God's ordained time.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   God was waiting for that particular time in human history
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   to send forth his Son to do what he did.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   So what made it the fullness of time?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Why did he wait until at that time to send his Son?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Human history for hundreds of years, maybe even thousands.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Israel had already received the law.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   They had their history. They had many other things going on.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   But what made that particular time, the ideal time, God-ordained time,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   to send Jesus Christ?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Superficially, we can look at that and say, well, Romans,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   they were in charge and everybody knows that Rome was known for their roads.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   So it was commonly understood that you were able to travel
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   more than any other time in history.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   That all of a sudden, that if the Gospel was going to be preached,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   you'd have to be able to travel from region to region.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And the Romans made that very easy to do.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   You could argue that maybe it's because of the cultures that were united.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   That Alexander the Great got together and conquered the nations.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And the Greek culture dominated even the Roman Empire.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   So as a result of that, they were able to communicate with one another,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   with language, and even similar cultures.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   We could argue that possibly because of the diaspora of the Jewish community,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   that they went out and went everywhere that the Apostles and Paul went
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   to preach the Gospel, that there was a synagogue there already ready
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   to receive the Gospel and to spread.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And obviously, all of these things played a key role in the success
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   of the Gospel being preached, superficially looking.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   But was that the reason why God waited until that particular time
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   to send Jesus Christ?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Couldn't He have prepared the roads prior to that?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Well, when we take a closer look at how God works,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   we know that God is not frustrated by human history.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   He wasn't waiting for the Roman government to be established
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   because He couldn't get His Apostles to travel unless there was roads
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   properly paved.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Scripture says that the law was given to the nation of Israel
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   in order to make sin utterly sinful.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And He needed that to play out in Israel's history.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Scripture says that Christ came to be the light of the world.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And in order to highlight the light, you need to turn off the light.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   The light becomes more evident and more useful when there is darkness.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   We can see in Israel's history, and we're highlighting three specific things
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   that we want to look at this morning, that highlights the fact that
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   the nation of Israel was experiencing the darkest period of their existence
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   during the time of Christ.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   The first thing we want to point out is the Roman domination.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I think every Jew, every single day, was reminded that they were under
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   pagan rule.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Now, the Romans were not the first.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   They were maybe the fourth or fifth empire that took over.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   See, this domination, this captivity, happened as early as 600 years prior
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   to the coming of Christ.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   It was the Assyrians, and then after the Assyrians came the Babylonians,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   and after the Babylonians came the Persians, and then after the Persians
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   came the Greeks, and then finally the Roman Empire took over.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   But of all the empires that took over and was dominated, no other nation
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   made themselves more aware of their dominating presence
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   than the Roman government.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   In fact, the account of Jesus' birth in the book of Luke, chapter 2, verse 1,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   it says that Caesar wanted to take a census, so he had everyone who was
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   traveling or maybe moved, had to go back to their hometown, wherever they
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   were born, and they had to go back to wherever that was and take a census.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And the reason why they had to take a census was it was Roman government
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   way of, one, keeping track of the people that they conquered,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   in order that, you know, just in case there's any kind of movement going on
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and they needed to make sure that if there was any kind of rebellion going on,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   they were keeping track of everybody that they conquered.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   And again, it was a vast empire, so they had to do this quite frequently.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   But another more practical reason was in order to collect taxes.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So they had to go back to their hometown and be counted so that they know
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   exactly how many people were in this hometown, and then they would exact
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   a tax from wherever they were from.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   The account of Jesus' birth begins in the book of Luke by telling us that
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   because Caesar enacted this census, that Joseph and Mary, who was in Nazareth
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   at the time, had to move back to Bethlehem to give birth, to be counted.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Now that distance is about 100 miles.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   100 miles would be from here to, I don't know, Northridge, the grapevine?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I don't know, is that even further than that?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   But imagine traveling that distance on unpaved road, for the most part,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   without a motor vehicle, while your wife is pregnant,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   a young family traveling that distance.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I mean, it was a tremendous burden, just that journey alone.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And the whole reason why you're doing that is not to visit your parents,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   is not to celebrate a holiday, just so that you can be counted by the Romans,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   so that you can pay tax.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's the end of this journey, all of it was so that you can give money
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   to this pagan nation that you resented.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   So can you imagine that every single person living at that time
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   who was moving around just to be counted in the census,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   that every single time that they walked, every step that they took,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   they had in their mind, "We have to do this because
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   these Romans are making us do this and pay taxes."
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   They were very aware of the situation that they were in.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   In fact, Jesus is teaching in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   in Matthew chapter 5, verse 41, Jesus says,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   "If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles."
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   In modern day culture, you and I, how do we even apply that?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   When was the last time somebody said, "Hey, go with me a mile."
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And then, "Oh, Jesus told me to go two miles,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   so I'm going to go two miles with you." Right?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   How does that even apply to us? What does this mean?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Well, in order to understand what Jesus is saying,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   you have to understand what the people were going through at that time.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Another law that the Roman government exacted upon the people that they conquered was
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   because in order to keep peace in this vast empire that they were overseeing,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   they had to spread their soldiers out everywhere.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   So, it was a common scene to see the Roman soldiers roaming around wherever you were at.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And because the Roman soldiers were burdened to carry all of this equipment around,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   and all of this was a public demonstration that if you ever rebel against God,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   we're going to come and squash you.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   So, in order for them to make it easy for the Roman soldiers to be able to travel between places,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   they made a law that if the soldier asked you to carry their equipment,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   that you have to stop whatever it is they're doing.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   You may be in the middle of business, you may be in the middle of farming,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   you may just be moving from house to house,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   but if the soldier asked you to take his equipment and take it for one mile,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   you had to do that by law.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   So, Jesus was speaking specifically to that law, and he says,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   "Well, I know that you resent this, but if they ask you to go a mile,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   instead of responding in anger and frustration, he said, 'Go an extra mile.'"
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   He was referring to that particular frustration of the law that they exacted.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   But beyond that, beyond what the Romans were doing,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   beyond the constant reminder of the burden of being conquered by this pagan nation,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   and seeing a statue of Caesar and being forced to bow before they enter the temple,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   their very king of Israel was an Idrumite.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And Idrumite, the history goes back, and basically he was an Edomite in the Old Testament,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   their history.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   So, if you read the Old Testament, you'll know that the Edomites
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   basically were the archenemy of Israel.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   They were the closest, and yet they were the biggest antagonist of the nation of Israel.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   So, if you read the prophets carefully,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   you'll notice that the Edomites are often mentioned as rejoicing over the fall of Israel.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And he said, "God is going to judge the Edomites for rejoicing instead of mourning."
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   So, can you imagine that above the Romans conquering them,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   that the very king that the Romans placed to oversee the nation of Israel
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   came from their own enemies, the Edomites.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   The nation of Israel was existing during that period of Jesus' coming,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   in a very dark period.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Now again, they've been under dominance for over 600 years,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   but nothing was more prominent,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   no other kingdom was more prominent and made their presence known more
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   than the nation of Israel, than the Roman Empire.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Not only was there a constant daily reminder
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   that the nation of Israel themselves were split into four separate groups.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Again, anytime hardships come, you see people reacting in a different way,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   their solution is very different.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Some people coil up and they just kind of disappear.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   You have some friends who are like that, when hardship comes, they just disappear.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   You have some friends who become very verbal, they're always reaching out,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   and they just can't sit still.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I have friends like that, whenever they drive,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   and for whatever reason, when there's something going on in their life,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   they drive very erratically.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   So, everybody has their different ways of responding,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   and their own solution to how to solve this problem.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And Israel was no different.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Because of this frustration, because of this pagan dominance,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   they had groups that came in, one group called the Sadducees.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Their answer was, "Well, let's make the best of it."
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   They were the aristocrats, they were the ones who were rich, the landowners,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   and they were the leaders of Israel, the Sadducees.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   These were the liberal people who basically gave up on God.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   What's the point in praying to God? What's the point of being religious and all this stuff?
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And after 600, 700 years, this is all we got.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   So, they learned to adapt.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   They became the senators of Israel.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And they were the ones who were the most afraid of losing their power,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   because they've learned to hold on to power within that system.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And obviously, because of that, they were very resented.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Even though they were the leaders of Israel, all of Israel resented them for that.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   There was another group of people called the Essenes.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Now, other than the fact that you're learning about this at church,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   you never hear about the Essenes, because these people basically went to the cave and disappeared.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   These are the kind of friends that when hardship comes, they just disappear for a while.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   When everything is okay, they'll come back.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Those were the Essenes. Right?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   And the only reason why we know so much about the Essenes is because we found a cave where they were dwelling,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   and there was all these artifacts that they found, and that's where we get the Dead Sea Scroll,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   because they preserved it in the caves.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   They basically disappeared. They just dropped out.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   We don't want to deal with Rome. We don't want to deal with the Sadducees.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   So they just dropped out, so we don't see them.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   We have a small group of people called the Zealots,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   and they are mentioned here and there through the New Testament.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   The Zealots were the people who were like, "Okay, do or die.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   I know humanly we can't, but we're not going to let them.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   These are the bravehearts of Israel.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Give me freedom or give me death."
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   So they were carrying swords around them constantly,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   just waiting for an opportunity to get into a holy war.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And these Zealots are the ones who got Israel in trouble later on,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   and then they ticked off the Roman Empire,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   and they come and destroy the nation of Israel as a result of their rebellion.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   And the people that are the most prominent,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   the fourth group of people are the people that we hear the most about in the New Testament,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   and they were the Pharisees.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   The word "Pharisee" basically means to be set apart.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And their answer to what was happening to the nation of Israel was
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   that maybe if we kept the law perfectly,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   maybe if we prayed more, maybe if we gave more,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   maybe if we apostatized and we kept the law of God perfectly,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   that God would be appeased, and maybe He will come,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   and He will deliver us.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Now each one of these groups didn't get along with each other.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Not only was there a constant reminder of the Roman dominance,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   even within the nation of Israel, there was no consensus.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   They were divided even within their own families.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   But all the trouble that the nation of Israel was under,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   the greatest and the most darkest part of Israel's history
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   was the 400 years of silence.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   The Scripture tells us that after Malachi finishes his prophecy,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   that there is no prophet for 400 years until John the Baptist shows up.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Theologians often call this period 400 years of silence.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   There was no prophet sent by God to speak on his behalf.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   And it was a clear judgment that God brought upon the nation of Israel.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   In Amos chapter 8, 11 through 12,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Amos shows up during a period when there was a lot of religious activity
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   going on in the nation of Israel.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   And this is the final judgment that God pronounces upon the nation.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   It says, "Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord God,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   when I will send a famine on the land, not a famine of bread,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   nor a thirst for water, but a hearing of the words of the Lord.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   They shall wander from sea to sea and from north to east.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   They shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   but they shall not find it."
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Now we may look at that and say, "Well, that was 400 years of silence,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   and maybe because they lost the scroll."
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Maybe the temple worship got shut down.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Maybe there was no place to go because of the judgment of God.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   But on the contrary, if you look at that period of Israel's history,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   they were more religious than any other period in their life.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   There was more activity happening in the temple.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Pharisees were actually committed to memorize Scripture.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   They fasted twice a week.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   They were even proselytizing, sending people out to make disciples.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   They set up a synagogue in almost every city.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   So if you trace Apostle Paul's ministry,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   there's only one or two cities that he went to where there wasn't a synagogue.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Every single city that he went to in the Roman Empire,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   there was already a synagogue there.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   So he would go into the synagogue, and he would be given basically the pulpit
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   to preach and to share about the Gospel.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   So the fact that there was silence for 400 years
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   doesn't mean that the word of God wasn't being preached.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   In fact, Josephus, a Jewish historian,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   actually has the exact number of lambs that were sacrificed
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   in a particular year during the time of Jesus' ministry.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And the reason why we have the exact number,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   that he was basically hired by the Roman Empire
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   to take a census of how many animals were being sacrificed,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   the lambs were being sacrificed, in order for them to take a census.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   So he has the exact number that was given to the Roman Empire,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   256,500 was the exact number that he gave the Roman Empire.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   And each one of these lambs represented at least 10 adult male.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   So basically what that means is that the sacrifices that was taking place
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   at the temple was probably more numerous than any other time in their history.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   And part of the reason why is because there was a prophecy,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   or there was a teaching going around in the Jewish Empire,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   that the Messiah was going to come during the Passover.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   And so this was beginning to spread, and it became a popular view.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   And during the Passover there was a stir upon Israel.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   So can you imagine when Jesus was riding on the donkey during the time of Passover,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   and people thinking that he was the Messiah, and the stir that must have created.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   The 400 years of silence from Malachi to John the Baptist
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   wasn't because the Word was not being taught.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   It wasn't because the temple got shut down.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   It wasn't because they didn't have enough permittings.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   That in the context of doing all of these things, Jesus says,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   "You call me Lord, Lord, but your heart is far from me."
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   It was a lot of religious and a lot of smoke screen, but not genuine worship.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   He said, "You're doing all these things, but yet it has nothing to do with me."
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   And at the end of Jesus' ministry, they didn't even recognize their Messiah.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   That their leaders, their Pharisees, have been proclaiming and teaching.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   The prophets have been-- every prophet in the Old Testament
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   almost ends with, "The Messiah is coming, Messiah is coming."
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   And yet when he finally comes, they completely miss him.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   John 1, 9-11, "The true light which enlightens everyone was coming into the world.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him."
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   See, the darkness in the nation of Israel, with all the physical signs,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   all the things, all the sentences that they had to take,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   all the taxes that they had to give to the Roman Empire,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   their greatest darkness was a darkness in their own hearts.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   And that's why when we read the account of Jesus' birth in the book of Matthew,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   it wasn't the priests or the scribes or the Pharisees or even their own king.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   It was this group of men called the Magi.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Some of your Bibles translated them as "wise men."
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Now, their identity is kind of a mystery, but there is a consensus
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   that they believe that these are Persian scholars, maybe astrologers.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Why did they know, and why did they recognize the coming of a foreign nation's king?
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Well, again, it's a common view that they believe that there was a prophecy given by Daniel
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   and that they were studying that Daniel was a prominent figure during that period, during the captivity.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   And they think, again, this is a theory, that possibly these guys were looking into this intently,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and they were able to calculate, based upon Daniel chapter 9,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   that this was a period when the king of Israel was going to appear,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   based upon Daniel's prophecies.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Now, again, all of these things are theories. We don't know that for a fact.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   But what we do know is that the whole nation of Israel was completely blind to his coming,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   and that these three pagans, outside of Israel, were the ones who were coming.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   They recognized the coming of the Messiah.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Not only that, we see in the account of Luke, that the angels appear,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   not to the chief priests, not to the Pharisees, but to the shepherds.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   The shepherds, at that particular time, was considered the lowliest job that you can have.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Because they were out in the field, they couldn't bathe, they had to tend to these animals,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   and so they didn't smell good.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   It was not a job that young men and women would aspire to be.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   So if you say you're a shepherd, automatically they say, "Oh, you're a shepherd."
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   So the fact that the account in Luke emphasizes that the angels showed up to the shepherds,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   lowly people, who have no significance, humanly speaking, in this world,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   that they were the ones that God reveals the coming of the Messiah.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   They were the first ones to come and want to give worship to their king.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   It is a slap in the face to the nation.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   And there's a reason why John the Baptist, when he comes to preach about the kingdom,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   he doesn't go to Jerusalem.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   He goes outside the Jerusalem, and he brings everybody out.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Because all of this is to convey what was happening with the nation of Israel.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   The 400 years of silence wasn't simply because the material wasn't being exposited.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Their hearts became so hardened that even though the Word of God was being taught,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   even though the sacrifices were being made, God was not in their midst.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   In the Matthew chapter 2 account, it says,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   "Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   'Where is he who has been born king of the Jews?
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.'
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   But when King Herod heard this, he was troubled."
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   We understand why King Herod would be in trouble.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Because he was already unpopular with the nation of Israel.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   So if the true king of Israel comes, the Messiah comes,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   of course he would be the first one who would be threatened.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   So we understand why he was threatened, but if you continue reading, it says,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   "Not only was he troubled, but all of Jerusalem was troubled with him."
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   All of Jerusalem.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And then in verse 4 it says, "And assembling all the chief priests and the scribes of the people,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   They told him, 'In Bethlehem of Judea, for it is written by the prophet.'"
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Now what that reveals to us is that the revelation of the coming of Christ was made clear.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   So the scribes knew.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   So when Herod gathered them together and asked them about the coming Messiah,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   they knew what the Bible said.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   But it reveals the darkness of their heart.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   You notice that it says that it doesn't say that all nation of Israel was troubled,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   it said all of Jerusalem was troubled.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And the significance behind that is that Jerusalem represented the spiritual elite of that time.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And again, as I said, this is the reason why John the Baptist doesn't enter into Jerusalem.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   That he's outside of Jerusalem.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Because there was a spiritual darkness in the temple.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   There was a spiritual darkness in the teaching.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   There was a spiritual darkness among the Pharisees who was fasting, who was praying,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   who was even evangelizing. But there was a spiritual darkness in them that they did not recognize.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   That in the midst of all this religious activity, they did not know God.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   The name of God was coming off their lips.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   They were reading it. They were memorizing scripture.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   They had it written on their sleeves.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   They had it written on their doorposts.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And every opportunity they got, they were talking about the coming Messiah,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   how He's going to come during the Passover.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And yet, three years after Jesus' ministry,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   after healing the sick, opening the eyes of the people who are blind,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   walking on water, calming the storm, even raising the dead,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   after three years of revealing Himself to them,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   at the end of three years, they reject Him.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   There's a reason why in the book of Isaiah, why false religion is highlighted.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   And why in Jesus' ministry, He highlights the Pharisees' hypocrisy
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   above the prostitutes, above the tax collectors.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   He said, "They were made righteous, but you were not."
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   These were the ones who were praying. These were the ones who were giving.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   These were the ones who were proselytizing and making disciples.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   And yet, Jesus says, "You are blind."
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   He tells His disciples, "Do what they tell you to do,"
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   because they sit in the seat of Moses, yet do not do what they do.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Because they are blind, leading the blind.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Think about the harsh message that Isaiah had to give to the nation of Israel.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   After seeing the glory of the presence of God in chapter 6,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   he sent to the nation of Israel, and the primary message that he has to the nation of Israel
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   is of judgment.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   We have the prophecies about the Messiah coming more written in the book of Isaiah
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   than any other book.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   But the primary sin of the nation of Israel wasn't paganism.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   It wasn't idol worship. It wasn't about following God.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   All these things did exist, but it wasn't the prominent sin of the nation of Israel.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   It was false worship.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   And he begins in the book of Isaiah, chapter 1, 11, he says,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   "What to me is a multitude of your sacrifices," says the Lord.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   "I have had enough of burnt offerings, of rams, and the fat of well-fed beasts.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   I do not delight in the blood of bulls or lambs or of goats."
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   What's interesting about everything that he says in chapter 1
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   is everything he says here is prescribed in the Mosaic law.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Moses, because it was given to the nation of Israel through God,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   they were doing all of these things because God prescribed them.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   But instead of describing them as worship, God says,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   "They are nothing than blood of bulls."
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Their singing was just noise to them.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Their assembly for worship, they called it evil assembly.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Instead of delighting in their gathering, he says,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   "They have become a burden to me."
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   In fact, he uses the term of their religious gathering as hate.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   I hate it.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   I think there's a reason why Jesus emphasized it.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   It wasn't Jesus.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Jesus didn't all of a sudden come and say, "You know what?
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   We've been tolerating this up to this point, but now this false worship,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   I've had enough."
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   God has been saying this throughout the nation of Israel's history.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Their primary sin was a deception that because of their many sacrifices,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   because of their temple attendance, because of all of these things,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   that they were somehow right with God.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Why was it the fullness of time?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   It was the fullness of time because the law of God became utterly sinful.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   The sin of Israel, the darkness that was upon the nation of Israel,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   was darker than any other period in Israel's history.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Imagine how darkened they must have been.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Imagine how hardened their heart must have been
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   when their own Messiah, the creator of the universe,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   stands before them and says, "I am."
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   And the response that he gets from them is they pick up stones
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   and they want to kill him.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   That's how hardened their hearts were,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   even in the midst of all of these sacrifices.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   See, in any way that we look at it,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   no matter what angle we look at the nation of Israel,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   they were absolutely without hope.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Politically, financially, and especially spiritually,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   they were absolutely without hope.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   It would only make sense that God would wipe them out
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   and start over with somebody else.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   It would only make sense if God would just wipe his hands clean
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   and walk away and do something else.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   These people are not worth salvaging and just to move on.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   But the reason why Paul says and God says
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   that this was the perfect time,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   because it is in darkness where his grace and his light
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   shines the brightest.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   He waits until we're so desperate.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   It isn't until that we see the need for a Savior,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   we see the need for saving,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   where the gospel in Christmas makes sense.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Why would a God of the universe
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   take on human form and walk on this earth?
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Why would he give himself to these young teenagers
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   with no money, traveling 100 miles just to get home
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   to pay the pagan nation taxes?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Why would an all-powerful, almighty, all-knowing God
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   place himself in the shoes that he placed himself in?
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   See, it was the perfect time
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   because mankind was without hope.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   The nation of Israel is often quoted in the scriptures
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   saying they represent all of us.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Everything that happened with the nation of Israel
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   and it's explained to us in 1 Corinthians 10,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   it happened as an example for us to look at and see,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   "Well, those people, I'm glad I'm not like them."
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   He says, "No, all of this happened as an example
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   for the rest of mankind.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Their spiritual darkness represented all of us.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Their need, their situation without hope
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   represents all of us."
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   See, every single one of us, when things happen,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   when darkness comes into our lives,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   we have a tendency to react just like the nation of Israel.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Some of us become more determined,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   we're going to work harder.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Some of us think that we have to be more clever.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Some of us think that we have to align ourselves
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   with the right people, that maybe we need to do this,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   we need to do that.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   And we can easily miss the point
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   that maybe the reason why God places us
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   in certain situations is the same reason
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   why God says this was the fullness of time.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Because it is in our desperation
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   where we need and long for God the most.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   See, 400 years of silence,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   400 years of hardening their hearts,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   400 years of giving false worship,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   400 years of God being silent.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Christmas represents the day
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   where God breaks into that silence.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Hebrews chapter 1, 1 and 2, it says,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   "Long ago at many times and in many ways,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   God spoke to our fathers, to the prophets.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   But in these last days, He has spoken to us by His Son,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   whom He appointed the heir of all things,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   through whom also He created the world."
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Christmas is where He breaks into that silence.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   He sees the hardness of His nation,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   and He comes to melt their hearts.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   He sees the lostness and the deception
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   that they were living under,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   and Jesus Christ comes, and He breaks into that deception.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   And He says, "No one comes to the Father but through Me.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   I am the way, I am the truth, I am the life."
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   It is Christ, the perfect image of God,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   speaking to the nation of Israel
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   for the first time in 400 years.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   1 Timothy 2, 5-7, it says, "For there is one God,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   there is one mediator between God and man,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   and the man Christ Jesus."
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   One mediator.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   So the whole ministry, the whole incarnation, Emmanuel,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   was so that He can be the perfect mediator.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   If you read the Gospel, there's two very detailed accounts
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   of Jesus' birth and what happened.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   One is written in the book of Matthew,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   the other one is written in the book of Luke.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Matthew highlights His kingship.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   And that's why Matthew begins with the genealogy,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   saying He's the fulfillment of the prophecy.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   He's the King of the Jews that is coming.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   So that's why the book of Matthew highlights the fact
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   that the prophecy went out, the King was coming.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   The King.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   That's why when the Magi's come,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   they recognize that they're not bringing gifts
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   to this lowly family, but to the King of Israel.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   So the frankincense and myrrh and oil,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   all of these things were gifts that you would offer to a king.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   They were not cheap things.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   But you look at the book of Hebrew,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   the book of Luke, it's completely the other side.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   It's the shepherds.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   The lowly shepherds are the ones who hear about it,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   and they come to Him, and then the account of Him
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   being born in a manger, this lowly family.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   You see one highlighting His kingship,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   the other highlighting His humility.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And the reason why that is written in that way
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   is because Jesus Christ was fully God and fully man.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Because only a fully God and fully man
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   could be the perfect mediator between us and God.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   He had to represent God to us,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   and He has to represent us to God.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   And that's what His sacrifice was,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   is to become that mediator.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Because we could not go to Him, He came to us.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Hebrews 4.15, it says,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   "For we do not have a high priest
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   "who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   "but one in every aspect, every respect,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   "has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   "Let us then, with confidence,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   "draw near to the throne of grace,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   "that we may receive mercy and find grace
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   "to help in time of need."
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   You know how difficult it is for us to be humble.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   We can fake humility.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   We can say certain things.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Our whole life is about elevating our status.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   We may not, some of us are good at hiding it.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Some of us are a little bit more sophisticated than that.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   But everything about human existence
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   is to elevate our status.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   That's why we work hard,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   we get a better education, right?
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   We want to look a certain way,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   you buy certain clothes, certain house.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   All of these things, in some way,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   obvious or not obvious,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   is a way to elevate our status.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And the scripture tells us that our pride
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   and that innate, natural desire
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   to elevate ourselves is what's killing us.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   That was the sin of Satan.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   That was the sin of Adam and Eve.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   That was the sin of, at the Tower of Babel.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   That was the sin of mankind.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Christ knew that the only way
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   that he can save mankind is to humble himself.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   He did exactly the opposite
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   of what you and I naturally do
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   every single day when we wake up.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   He who knew no sin became sin,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   that he might become the righteousness of God.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   The Christmas that we celebrate today
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   is a day that we celebrate
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   the Lion of Judah became the Lamb of God.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   That sinners like you and I
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   can be reconciled to a holy God.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   As we celebrate Christmas,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   as we think upon what this day represents,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   I know that there's a whole culture
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   and everything going on.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   I don't think any of that stuff is wrong
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   and I'm not here to put a guilt chip
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   because you bought presents for your family members.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   These are all blessings that God has given us.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   You know I thank God that we are able to come
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   and worship and don't have to worry about
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   this church being blown up.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   I was reading an article even yesterday
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   about how the Indians are having a hard time
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   in India celebrating Christmas
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   because they are being persecuted
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   for celebrating Christmas.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   And I thank God that we live in a country
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   where we can provide for our family
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   and gather together and worship
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   and have Bible studies
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   without the threat of these things.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   But if we forget,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   if we forget,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   if we think that that's our hope,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   God's blessing can easily turn into a curse.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   If all the blessings that God has given us
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   turns us into superficial worshipers of God,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   every gift, every blessing,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   every freedom that we have been given
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   can easily turn to harden our hearts.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   I pray that as we celebrate Christmas today,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   that we would take some time
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   to consider carefully why He had to come.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   He had to come.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Not because of their sins,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   not because of Israel,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   but because of the darkness that resides in you
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   and resides in me.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   And that the only way that He could have reconciled us
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   was by taking on human form.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   He humbled Himself because we would not.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   He humbled Himself because we could not.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   He who knew no sin
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   became sin,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   that you and I may become the righteousness of God.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   Let's take some time to meditate and think about that,
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   again, as we invite our worship team to come up
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   and lead us in worship.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Take some time to pray,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   to come before the Lord in honest prayer.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   And if you are in a dark place,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   it may be the fullness of time
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   that God is calling you.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   There's no other time in your life
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   where you are in desperate need of the grace of God
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   than when your heart is the hardest,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   when you've drifted so far.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   This is when we need to plead.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   This is when God draws near.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   So let's take some time as we meditate
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   and think upon His grace
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   as our worship team leads us.
