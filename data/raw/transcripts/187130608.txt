[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   We're going to be reading Romans chapter 7 verse 7 through 12
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.980]   Okay
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.440]   and but as you're turning your Bible there one of the questions that I asked you on Facebook if you guys were able to look
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.440]   at that before you came and read it is
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.100]   Who is Paul referring to? Okay, so I'm gonna read it again, and I'm gonna
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.800]   Ask you guys to just kind of think through and then we'll deal with that before we jump in
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.440]   but when Paul says I would not have known sin for I would not have
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.080]   Known what it is to covet if the law had not said you shall not covet
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.280]   And then he says once I was I was once alive verse 9 apart from the law
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.060]   But when the commandment came sin came alive and died so is Paul talking about his personal experience
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.520]   of conversion
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.400]   Is he talking about the Jewish community?
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.200]   The nation of Israel before and after the Mosaic Law or is he referring to mankind?
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.840]   representing himself
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.360]   in the context of mankind like Adam and Eve and how they were alive before the law came and how they fell and
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.720]   How death came as a result of that?
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.520]   So is he talking about Adam and Eve representing mankind?
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.320]   Is he talking about the nation of Israel or is he talking about his personal experience because based on how?
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.580]   Strictly you interpret that you may have a different understanding of what Paul is gonna say
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.780]   Not only in this text, but for the rest of the book of Rome the chapter 7
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.360]   So what we're gonna be talking about this morning about that
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.020]   I'm just gonna mention it briefly and then hopefully that'll help us carry on and understand the text next few weeks as well
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.140]   Okay, so having said that let's read this passage verse 7 through 12
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.060]   What then shall we say that the law is sin by no means?
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.460]   If it had not been for the law
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.860]   I would not have known sin for I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had said not
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.620]   Have not said you shall not covet but sin seizing an opportunity through the commandment produced to me all kinds of covetousness
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.380]   For apart from the law sin lies dead
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.120]   I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came sin came alive and I died
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.900]   The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me for sin seizing an opportunity through the commandment
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.860]   Deceived me and through it killed me. So the law is holy and the commandment is holy and righteous and good
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.700]   Let's pray
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.420]   Lord we offer this time to you
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.980]   Just asking father God that your Holy Spirit would do what we are not able to do by our own strength or will
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.020]   That you would use these words to illuminate our hearts our minds our lives
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.940]   That we may be surrendered Lord God not with just lip service that we may be changed Lord not just in mind
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.940]   But our very hearts and lives and wills as well
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.540]   So we ask Lord God that you would be gracious to us as you are always gracious
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.060]   Bless this time Lord in Jesus name. We pray. Amen
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.700]   I'm gonna give you a quick answer to that before we jump into
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.620]   What Paul is saying here the quick answer to what I the question I asked is yes all of them
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.820]   Okay, he's referring to in my opinion all of them and I think Douglas Moo and John Stott agrees with this and again
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.220]   There's various opinions on this but I go I believe according to the text and again
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.700]   I've wrestled through this text so many times and the best interpretation that I find is that Paul obviously is
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.620]   speaking in the first person referring to
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.380]   The Jewish community and and how they viewed the law and how he's trying to correct them in the way that they saw the law
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.140]   Him himself saying he was Pharisee among Pharisees uses himself as a first person, right?
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.140]   So if you remember the text the context that Paul is talking about he says in earlier in chapter 6
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.940]   I am talking to you who have the law specific to the Jews
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.560]   the larger context from chapter 1 all the way to chapter 7
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.980]   He's talking to Jews
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.340]   Because they had a hard time believing that the law did not save them and Paul is trying to argue with them all have sinned
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.740]   And fall short of the glory of God
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.420]   So the whole context Paul has been talking to the Jews a correct understanding of the law which brings condemnation
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.340]   Him being a Jew among Jews before he was converted uses himself as a first person
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.780]   But having said that that doesn't limit it to the nation of Israel
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.780]   Because how a Jew understood the law was no different than how a Christian would understand a Bible
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.540]   when we hear the word law we ask the question is he talking about the Mosaic law the ceremonial law the moral law the civil law and
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.820]   We compartmentalize different parts of the law and we're trying to identify what specifically it is
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.820]   But a Jew when he heard the word law he to him. It was the Bible
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.660]   Instructions giving in the given in the Bible on how you ought to please God and worship God
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.420]   So even in the New Testament we can divide it into civil law how we ought to behave in society
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.920]   we can divide it into ceremonial law how we have
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:09.020]   Communion and baptisms and the teachings about the church or moral laws that are repeated in the New Testament about you know
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.140]   Honoring your father and mother and not to covet and not to steal
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.180]   But just like you and I would understand when we read the scripture
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.700]   Then we say well
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.620]   What does the scripture mean the old in the Old Testament the Jews when they heard the word law to him?
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.620]   It just meant the Word of God
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.640]   Right the Word of God and how they understood God's Word. So when he Paul's talking about here
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.660]   he's he I believe the application is really to all mankind even though he's speaking in the first person as a
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.740]   representative of the nation of Israel
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.580]   Israel is a smaller illustration of the larger picture of mankind. So the reason why I think this is important
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.760]   I don't want you guys to read this and study this and say well, okay
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.180]   That's relevant to the Jews because the Jews struggled with this
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.120]   The problem that he's dealing with is a struggle with mankind
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.500]   Both old and a New Testament
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.060]   So I want to place that so that the next few weeks when we are studying through the book
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.240]   The Romans in particular chapter 7 that nobody sits in here thinking like oh, okay
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.940]   That's that's the problem that the Jews have it is very much relevant to us
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.140]   So let's jump into the text
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.300]   You know, how many guys know who Jim Jones is?
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   Jim Jones
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.020]   Wow, even less than the first server first service. We had three. Okay. Now we have one
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.080]   Thank you Lee and wife. All right
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.100]   Jim Jones was a cult leader
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:42.540]   in the 1970s or 1950 60s and 70s and he took a bunch of
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.380]   Disenfranchised Christians who fell out of the church and joined his church and eventually this man was so charismatic
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.780]   He sold himself as the Messiah. And so he was a very charismatic leader
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.740]   And so he began to gather to himself thousands of people
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:03.020]   And then their rumors started to come out that within his church that he established in 1956
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.060]   The name of it was people's temple and there was a lot of stories of abuse
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.900]   That sometimes that even in his worship service
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:16.400]   He would make men and women strip naked and dance around and he was just asserting his authority and when this news came out
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:23.140]   He sold himself as being persecuted and he took over more than a thousand people moved all the way to Guiana
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.740]   And he established a commune there
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.620]   Well people were so concerned about what was happening to this cult
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.820]   they went after him even the government US governments went after him and there was a lot of
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.780]   Lot of persecution or or beating and abuse that was taking place
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.980]   and when they found out that the government was coming all the way over there to shut them down and possibly
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:51.660]   Extra died him and take him into prison because of the abuse he decided that he was going to have everybody commit suicide
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.340]   so he gave over
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:01.100]   918 people to and commanded them to drink cyanide in the form of a fruit punch and
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.980]   918 people committed suicide and
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.900]   276 of them being children
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:14.180]   So again this happened in the 1970s and and I think people who lived in the 70s 80s
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.260]   I mean everybody knows who Jim Jones is because it was such a horrific story
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:22.540]   Can you imagine all those people who committed suicide?
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.740]   realizing that at the end when they wake up and
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.140]   They're gonna face a holy judge and realize that the Messiah that they thought was the Messiah was the wrong Messiah
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:38.260]   They're absolutely instead of finding life that there was gonna be condemnation for what they did
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:43.300]   You see the nation of Israel as a whole
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.380]   Was misled for over a thousand years
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:54.860]   The law was given to the nation of Israel in Deuteronomy 27 verse 6
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:00.340]   Moses stood and he said cursed be anyone who does not confirm
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:06.840]   The words of the law by doing them and all the people shall say amen and they cried out. Amen
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:14.140]   when they received the law is that if you do not obey this command let them be cursed and
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.720]   The whole congregation of Israelites said amen
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:27.980]   So we can understand why the Pharisees of the time of Jesus took the took the commandments so seriously
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:33.460]   They had over six hundred and thirteen laws that every faithful Jew was to follow
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.060]   meticulously
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:40.860]   out of the six hundred and thirteen laws two hundred and forty-eight were commands of things that they ought to do and
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.060]   365 were things not to do
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:51.100]   But you can understand why they were so meticulous in in obeying this command because the whole nation of Israel
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:56.180]   Received the law saying if we do not obey let us be cursed. Amen. Amen
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.020]   and
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.020]   Yet when we come to the time of Christ
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:06.940]   Paul says in Galatians 3 10 and 11 for all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.460]   For it is written curse be everyone who does not abide by all things
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.380]   Written in the book of the law and do them now
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.180]   It is evident that no one is justified before God by the law. The righteous shall live by faith
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:23.100]   We come to the time
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:29.120]   1,500 years after they receive the commandment in Deuteronomy 27 26 Paul now says
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.580]   1,500 years later
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:37.980]   Everyone who thinks that by keeping the law that somehow you're gonna live he is already under a curse
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.940]   He is not and does not get justified by the law
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.300]   for
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.460]   1,500 years they were led astray
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.260]   and especially in the time of Christ
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:57.500]   You can understand before we jump and and
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.020]   condemn the Israelites
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.220]   You see how difficult of a task for a possible Paul
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:09.020]   For not just one not a small group not just one generation for generation after generation after generation
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.700]   They believe this lie
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:17.740]   That if we just keep this command if we keep the meticulous see we will be saved
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:23.740]   So we can understand why they had such a hard time and
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.820]   even those who converted
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.140]   Wouldn't fully convert
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:35.620]   They accept Christ and his grace and faith and it's a wall. That's true. We believe that we've seen eyewitnesses
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.900]   We had our brothers and sisters healed so we can't deny the fact that he was the Messiah and he was raised from the dead
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.420]   We can't deny that there's too many people who know who've seen it
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.700]   Yet even then they wouldn't let go of the Judaistic law
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:53.860]   So the big question is
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:03.020]   If the law brings condemnation then what was the law given for you mean for all these years not just me my parent my great
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:10.580]   Grandparents the high priest the Pharisees the scribes for generations. They were all wrong
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.980]   Then what was the law for?
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:19.020]   That's the question that Paul's been trying to answer in the last chapter
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.900]   Then what is the law for if we're not saved by the law?
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:27.780]   Then what is the law for so in verse 7 through 12 Paul is going to be discussing again. It's
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.780]   It's not limited to these 12 verses but for this morning for 7 through 12
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.820]   He's going to be discussing what the purpose of the law was for
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.420]   If it is not for salvation
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.540]   Let's look at verse 7
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.780]   Yet if it had not been for the law again 7b
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.060]   Okay in the middle yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:53.780]   I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said you shall not covet
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:59.700]   So the first and most important thing that Paul says that the law was given for is to reveal sin
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.420]   first and foremost
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:10.400]   When he says that the law came to reveal sin he's not saying that the law somehow made them of made them
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:20.060]   Made them a better whatever like again as an illustration if those of you took CPA exams or board exam for medical for medical school
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:25.860]   Or to become a doctor or or lawyers who had to take the bar. Those are very intense tests
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.980]   But the test doesn't make you a good lawyer
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:35.760]   Right. The test doesn't make you a good attorney or a doctor or or or an accountant
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.420]   They only reveal what you already know or don't know
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:45.620]   So the first thing that the Bible says that that the Word of God came and does the first thing
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.660]   Is to reveal
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.500]   What is it already in us it reveals sin?
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.580]   See James chapter 1 22
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.260]   Likens the Word of God as a mirror
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.500]   Somebody who look who hears the Word of God and does not practice them
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.900]   It's like somebody who stands before a mirror and he walks away and he forgets what he looks like
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:10.780]   Right. I mean we have all kinds of different purposes for having a mirror at home
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.620]   But the primary reason is so that you can do your hair before you come to church, right?
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:20.660]   Make sure your socks match that you don't have toothpaste on your nose
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:26.300]   That whatever you ate this morning, you don't have green things sticking in the middle of your teeth so you can present yourself
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:31.340]   Well, I mean the primary reason is to see yourself in the mirror and to see what you need to fix
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.140]   James says an
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.660]   Individual who looks into the Word of God the mirror and keeps looking at it
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.660]   And he doesn't see his own sin is an individual just walks away. It's like, okay
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:49.020]   See in a time of the Prophet Amos and Isaiah
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.780]   It was a period when the Israelites were very religious
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.380]   They weren't in any kind of political battle
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:01.940]   Financially, they were doing well because of periods of peace. So there was a lot of sacrifices being made at the temple
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:09.220]   But yet God sends prophets and keeps warning them that the judgment is coming. And so they were they were confused
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.460]   Why would God be angry with us?
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.380]   Look how busy we are at the temple. Look how many sacrifices that we're making I
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.540]   Can understand his hatred toward the Assyrians and the pagans?
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:28.580]   But that's behind us. We're worshipping Yahweh at the temple. Why would he be angry with us?
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:35.660]   Yet at the book of Amos God says he was going to bring a plumb line and measure to see to show them
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:41.300]   Where they have gone wrong and the plumb line that he was referring to was the Word of God
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:46.660]   It was like a modern-day leveler that on the surface you may look like is that I looks alright
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:52.940]   But God's gonna bring the plumb line and show you just how crooked the temple is and just how crooked the Nation of Israel is
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:58.540]   So the scripture says first and foremost was given to reveal sin
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.020]   That we can identify the sin in our own hearts
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:09.340]   See where God has primarily placed his glory. The scripture says it's in his word
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.660]   He he's represented his glory in his word
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.440]   His very breath is in his word
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.480]   Every time we see people who are encountering God the first
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.180]   Response that we see from them is a sense of awe and terror
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.420]   Because they recognize sin that they didn't see before
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.700]   Do you remember Isaiah when he saw a glimpse of the throne of these creatures?
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:42.460]   Flying around. Holy. Holy. Holy. The first thing he recognizes is not the sin of his nation
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.260]   The first thing he recognizes is his own sin
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.980]   In the presence of this Holy God
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.800]   And he falls down and he says woe is me. Woe is me
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.900]   I am a man of unclean lips from a people of unclean lips. He recognizes his own sin
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:03.220]   Not only his own sin, but in light of that he says I'm from all these people who are also unclean
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:08.380]   The first and most important word for worship is
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:16.420]   Proskuneo in the Greek and the word literally means to bow down to prostrate to fall down in honor and in terror
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:22.620]   That is the most common word in the New Testament translated for worship
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:29.540]   most common word that is also translated from the Hebrew word worship translated in the Septuagint is
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.620]   Proskuneo worship to be prostrated in fear
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.780]   Every instance those of you who are with us in Wednesday Bible study a few weeks ago
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:44.140]   We talked about the holiness of God and every instance whether it's Ezekiel in chapter 128 in the presence of this Holy God
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.620]   He falls down in terror
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.300]   proskuneo
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:54.300]   Matthew chapter 17 verse 5 and 6 when the disciples at the Transfiguration hear the voice of God
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.220]   They fall down in terror and proskuneo
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:03.620]   In Revelations 1 17 when Apostle John sees a vision of his throne same response
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.900]   He recognizes his own sin in proskuneo and he falls face down
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.420]   Revelations 5 14 the four beasts and the 24 elders in the presence of this Holy God
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.580]   Recognize their own sin and they fall down prostrated
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.900]   in terror
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.060]   in every instance in Scripture
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:31.620]   When God's glory is revealed the first thing that happens is recognition of their own sin
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:36.300]   See the scripture first and foremost was given to us
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.100]   To reveal our sin our sinful state
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:46.980]   Now again as we said in the very beginning if you take the law of God's that well, we're not under the Mosaic Law
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.220]   We don't preach the Mosaic Law
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:54.540]   So we don't have that issue as I mentioned that Paul is not simply talking about Jews. He's talking about the Word of God
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.740]   all the commandments of God
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.020]   First and foremost is to reveal who we are
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.340]   See when Jesus came
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:12.300]   The nation of Israel did not reject him because he wasn't handsome enough. He didn't give enough food or he didn't heal enough
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.340]   They were angry with him
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:23.060]   Because he kept on revealing their sins and they didn't want to hear it if you remember in the early part of Jesus's ministries
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:29.100]   The scribes and the Pharisees and the leaders of Israel heard about Jesus
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.980]   Maybe he is the Messiah
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.580]   That they've been preaching the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the scribe
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:42.580]   They were the ones teaching the nation of Israel that the Messiah is coming Messiah is coming and when he comes
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:47.020]   Everything that we lost to the pagans are going to be restored
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.980]   So they're the ones who've been preaching to wait for the Messiah to look for the Messiah
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.220]   So when they started hearing that maybe Jesus is the Messiah
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:20:01.220]   Initially, they were very intrigued. They didn't reject him right away. They went all the way to Galilee
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.140]   I mean, these are very wealthy prominent men
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:11.140]   That that went all the way up to Galilee a several days journey just to see who he is
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:17.900]   Even when John the Baptist came out and all these people were going out to the wilderness to hear could he be the Messiah?
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.300]   What did they say when they saw these Pharisees coming?
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.020]   You fruit of vipers
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.820]   Who told you to come?
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.740]   Bear fruit in accordance with your repentance. He called them out
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.300]   That's exactly what Jesus said repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:41.600]   So the very first message that he gave was exactly the opposite was probably what the Pharisees were thinking
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.500]   because if anybody kept the law by the by the
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:53.500]   Standard of righteousness that anybody would use at that time and probably even today the Pharisees were righteous
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.460]   They prayed more than anybody else
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.140]   They gave more than anybody else. They weren't stingy people
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.740]   They knew the law more than anybody else
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:10.660]   They even made disciples and proselytize they travel far distances to make disciples more than anybody else
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:18.740]   So by any human standard they were the righteous ones. They knew the scriptures. They were the PhDs in theologies
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.700]   But when they came to Jesus
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.700]   First thing Jesus did was reveal their sin
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:32.900]   And that's why they didn't like him if Jesus embraced him and so okay now you follow me and made them his disciples
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.220]   He wouldn't had that problem
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.740]   But he flipped the switch
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:45.620]   Instead he took tax collectors. He took sinners common people
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:52.900]   How could he use them as disciples and just completely bypass us he can't be the Messiah
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.380]   If that was the Messiah, he would recognize who we are
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.380]   And because he doesn't recognize our righteousness
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.980]   He clearly can't be the Messiah because to say he's the Messiah means
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.380]   Everything that they were thinking about where they stood before God was wrong
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.300]   And they just could not accept that
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.460]   see first and foremost
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.680]   The Word of God was given to us to reveal sin
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.300]   The rich young ruler that came to Jesus in Mark chapter 10 said what do I do good teacher?
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.300]   to have eternal life
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:32.920]   Jesus knows exactly what he was thinking. He said you must obey all the commandments perfectly and he says in arrogance I did
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:41.480]   And I'll bet you he was probably more moral than the average person. I bet you in his mind. He did he kept everything in comparison
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:46.700]   Yet knowing exactly what he was thinking he pinpoints and it wasn't a challenge to him
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.340]   It was basically Jesus shutting the door in his face
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.740]   Knowing he was rich
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.780]   Sell everything that you have give it to the poor and come after me
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:01.340]   To tell a rich young ruler to sell everything basically means to die
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.060]   It basically means to die
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.460]   Give up everything give up your house
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:12.780]   Give up your wealth your prestige that maybe the money that your parents earned your grandparents earned
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:18.340]   And maybe you earn give it all away and start over if you want to enter the kingdom in that way
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.620]   And that's exactly what he told Nicodemus
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.940]   Expert of the law who kept the law meticulously
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:28.420]   How do I get saved you must be born again? How do you do that?
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.140]   You can't
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:37.740]   Jesus was shutting the door if you think that that's how somehow you're gonna be saved. That's how you measure righteousness. You're wrong
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:44.700]   Because first and foremost the Word of God comes and judges the thoughts and intentions of our hearts
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.780]   Not the heart of our nation
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.300]   Not the heart of our brothers and sisters in Christ
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.820]   Not the heart of the other church
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:24:00.540]   Or other people around us first and foremost when we read the Word of God the initial intention of encountering God is to reveal
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.420]   sin in us
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.420]   in us and
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.900]   If it is not revealed in us you missed the whole point of the Word of God
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:17.980]   George Whitfield in training young pastors to become preachers would often say you must wound them before you heal them
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:23.260]   Until they are wounded the healing will be superficial
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:30.260]   And that's exactly what Paul is trying to say here in this passage that the law was given to reveal your sin first and foremost
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.540]   Spurgeon
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:38.640]   Speaking of a superficial revival that was taking place during his generation says this
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:46.320]   Sometimes we are inclined to think a great portion of modern revival revivalism has been more a curse than a blessing
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.420]   Because it has led thousands to a kind of peace before they have known their misery
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:57.340]   Restoring the prodigal to the father's love and never making him say father. I have sinned
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:04.300]   Unhumbled they come into the church on humble. They remain in it and on humble they go from it
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:11.860]   Unless the law of God and the Word of God first convicts us and humbles us it has missed the mark
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:17.380]   See the Jews their problem was they thought that God created righteousness on a curve
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.220]   No Jew would ever stand before God and say I am perfect
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.820]   They're not fools
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.900]   But they thought God created righteousness on a curve
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:34.060]   That they were maybe B students and they were looking down on C students and these tax collectors were F students
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:39.820]   Not realizing that they were all F students just in different degrees
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:47.360]   See they thought God created on a curve not realizing that even one sin
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.860]   even one sin
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.260]   Would make them unrighteous and deserving of death
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.340]   because Adam and Eve
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:03.500]   The condemnation that came into their life and to all mankind as a result of their sin was one sin
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:11.340]   Genesis chapter 3 in chapter 2 does not describe years and generations of depravity
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.980]   It describes one sin
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.860]   They ate the fruit one event
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:25.300]   They broke one command and as a result of that one command that one sin was so hideous before this. Holy. Holy. Holy God
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.380]   that mankind
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.340]   deserve condemnation for eternity one sin
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:38.680]   See the problem is we see sin in light of other people's sins
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:43.260]   So as long as we are not as sinful as the people who are around us
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:50.100]   We feel safe and that's exactly what the Pharisees were doing that God was grading them on a curve and on a curve
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.460]   Yes, they were much more righteous. Of course, they're more righteous than a tax collector
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.820]   Tax collector was cheating people out of money poor people. I
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.180]   Mean a zealot was ready to kill people
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:10.180]   They weren't adulterers. They weren't prostitutes these guys their mistake was they were serving at the temple. Maybe not with the right heart
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:16.540]   How can they be greater sinners if so, if God created them on a curve they would have been on the top of the list
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.380]   But that was their blindness
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.980]   They didn't recognize their sin before God
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:30.580]   See Jesus during the 40 years of test of 40 days of testing
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:36.260]   Satan was trying to tempt in and if he fell even in one sin, it would have disqualified him
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.020]   to be our Savior
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:45.740]   Because the sacrifice had to be perfect and just have Adam with one sin brought condemnation to the world
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:50.180]   Jesus with one sin could have been disqualified to save us
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.900]   one sin
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:58.100]   See Matthew 5 48. It says you therefore must be perfect as your Heavenly Father is perfect
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:05.180]   Again in Matthew 5 20 and it says for I tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:11.860]   You will never enter the kingdom of heaven. How can you exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees who kept?
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.100]   613 laws meticulously day in and day out
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:23.820]   How can their righteousness be exceed the scribes in other words you can't
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.220]   That does not bring life
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:32.460]   In fact in John chapter 8 when Jesus says he will bides in my word and my words abide to him
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.980]   He is my disciple. He shall know the truth and true shall set you free
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.820]   When we hear that we say wow, that's that's awesome
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.540]   God came to bring us freedom
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.580]   But when the Jews heard this they became angry
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.580]   What do you mean set free?
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.420]   We've never been slaves. We're children of Abraham
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.980]   How can you tell us that we need freedom?
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:58.060]   and so the argument goes back and forth with Jesus in John chapter 8 and
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.860]   They would not back down Jesus what you're saying does not make any sense
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:10.500]   Clearly, you're not an average prophet. Maybe you are the Messiah, but if you are how do you not recognize who we are?
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.860]   the righteousness the obedience
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.980]   The meticulous way we sacrifice to stay righteous and clean
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:25.020]   how can you not recognize that and say like with any other sinner that we need to be set free and
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:32.460]   They just could not accept that and as a result of that Jesus calls them out in John chapter 8 44
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.220]   You do not understand me because you are not from where I am
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:41.620]   He said where are where are we from then? Who is our father? Your father's the devil?
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:49.340]   That's why so you see the first thing that Jesus distinguished between a Christian and a non-christian a
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:55.220]   Christian is the one who comes before God in his word and recognizes and is humbled and is convicted
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.220]   by his own guilt
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:02.300]   And he said that's the first and foremost thing that the Word of God was given for
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:08.140]   There is no sin that is more dangerous in our lives than a sin that we we are not aware of
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:15.740]   There's no sin that is more dangerous in a church and a sin that we are not aware of or we just kind of swept
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:16.980]   It under the rug
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:21.940]   Or we dismissed it or we compared it with other people and say it's not as bad
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:27.260]   Of course, no one's perfect, but I'm not as bad as them. There is no sin that is more dangerous and more
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:34.580]   Destructive in a life of an individual or a church or a generation than the sin that he does not see clearly
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:44.000]   So the first and foremost the Word of God is given to expose sin and that was what it was intended to do
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.540]   That when we come before the Word of God
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.820]   It judges the thoughts and intentions of my heart
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.220]   It recognizes that there's adultery in me
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.760]   That there's hatred and murderous thoughts in me
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.460]   That there's coveting in me not just them in me
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.380]   There's self-righteousness dwelling in me
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:10.060]   There's hatred and divisiveness in me. There's slandering it coming out of my mouth
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:14.260]   There's disobedience in me
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:19.740]   So first and foremost if we want to draw near to God the Word of God exposes all of that
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.060]   And the reason why is pretty obvious
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:28.620]   He who does not recognize his sin will not repent
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:36.780]   First step of justification is recognizing and owning up to his sin
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:42.820]   But the second third fourth and every other step is no different
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.440]   Not only does it reveal sin in verse 8 it said aggravates in
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.460]   But sin seizing an opportunity through the commandment produced in me all kinds of covetousness
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:58.300]   Apart from the law sin lies dead when he says here it produced in me
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:03.340]   It kind of has a wrong understanding at least in the English. We think it was created but the word there
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.340]   It means to stir up passion
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:10.980]   To stir it up. I think the best way for us to understand it is if you've ever seen a
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:15.820]   You know a bucket of water or something and it was dirty and you let it sit for a while
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:20.860]   You know how the dirt kind of sinks to the bottom and then the good water is up on the top and you look at it
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.740]   So it looks clean
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.740]   Until you kick it
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:30.060]   Until you stir it up and all of a sudden the dirt gets all stirred up and you realize oh my god is filthy
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:35.420]   So that's a description that Paul is giving when the law came sin was dormant
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:39.820]   But when the law came it stirred up in me all kinds of passion to reveal this in
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.180]   Augustine
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:49.380]   if you've never read this book, I highly recommend those of you who are theologically astute and you you want to get into it if
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.300]   you haven't read that I highly recommend because
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.420]   It really helped me to understand
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:59.540]   This in this particular subject of sin and grace
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:05.300]   Augustine was a man who was very honest with his sin, you know
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:11.020]   And I think that's what made him such a great theologian and a Christian because he never excused his sin
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:15.220]   He was he was very open and honest. That's why the book is called confession. It's basically his testimony
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.340]   This is a man who lived in order debauchery
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:24.420]   He had sex. I mean adultery. I mean drugs, whatever
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.540]   I mean you could think of any kind of debauchery could think of he practiced it to the fullest
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:34.020]   He had the resources to do it, but he says in his book the second book of confession
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:42.220]   The sin that bothered him the most was a sin when him and his friends went to his neighbor's yard to steal some peaches
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:46.740]   He said of all the sins that bothered him that's in bothered him the most
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.540]   Which kind of sounds strange?
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.700]   considering who he is
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:57.540]   This is like a drug dealer, you know, only thing he didn't do was murder somebody he might have done that
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:04.340]   I don't remember, you know, but he said of all the sins and this is why he doesn't he he describes why that's in in particular
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.340]   Bothered him more than any other sin. This is what he says
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.460]   It was not the pairs that my unhappy soul desired
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:14.300]   I had plenty of my own better than those and I picked them so that I might steal
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.980]   For no sooner had I picked them then I threw them away and tasted nothing in them
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.780]   But my own sin which I relished and enjoyed
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:25.820]   He says he had better peaches in his own house
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:31.540]   And it wasn't because he wanted peaches. It was just a thrill with his friends
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:39.340]   In another passage that since I had no real power to break God's natural law meaning that he recognizes his limitation
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:45.160]   He can't fly, you know, he can't hold his breath underwater. He can't do what God does. He can't break God's natural law
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.900]   Was it that I enjoyed at least a pretense of doing so?
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:54.620]   Like a prisoner who creates for himself the illusion of liberty by doing something wrong when he has no fear of punishment
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.620]   under a feeble hallucination of power
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.640]   He's examining his own heart. Why did I do that?
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:06.460]   And he's just contemplating possibly could it be the feeling of power?
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:14.060]   And then he finally says I must have gotten pleasure from the crime itself from the thrill of having partners in sin
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:21.180]   This was a friendship of most unfriendly sort bewitching my mind in an inexplicable way for the sake of laugh a little sport
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:25.780]   I was glad to do harm and anxious to damage another all because we are
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.700]   We are ashamed to hold back when others say come on, let's do it
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.140]   His
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:40.160]   Confession is the reason why that's in bothered him more than anything else is that sin more than any other sin revealed his nature
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.580]   It revealed a corrupt nature
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:51.580]   See Paul is saying not only did sin reveal it that when sin when the law came it stirred up and in me all kinds of
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:55.660]   Passion why does when God says not to do something does it cause us want to do it?
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.580]   Anybody who's raised children know exactly what I'm talking about. It doesn't work all the time
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:04.660]   But it works a lot of the time you're trying to feed them peace
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:10.000]   They don't like it, but you know the health benefits of peace and you try to shove it in their mouth
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.260]   They spit it out
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:16.340]   And all of a sudden you you you become an expert parent and he said, okay, you can't have it
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:20.020]   Your brother's gonna have it you can have any of it. It's like oh, no, no, no
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:24.740]   No, you can't have it. Your brother's gonna have it and the brother eats. It's like do you like it? Yes, I
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:32.780]   Like it right just to show the younger brother and as soon as he sees his brother enjoying it and he can't have it
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.780]   What happens? I
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.900]   Want some
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:43.340]   Why does he all of a sudden desire something that he can't have but when we ask him to have it he doesn't want it
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.580]   Did somebody teach him that?
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:54.320]   Did he go to some hard school was he in prison for a while and that's where he picked up these bad habits
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.720]   No
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.720]   It's in us
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.720]   We're born with it
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.800]   Original sin is deeply embedded in us
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:09.720]   And that's why the scripture says the law was given first and foremost to reveal what was in us
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:17.320]   Because until we recognize the sin in our own hearts not in our nation not in our neighbor not in our husband and wife our kids
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.400]   but in us
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.920]   There's no repentance
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.920]   Repentance is shallow
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.360]   superficial
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.400]   And always thinking that I will be a better person if other people were better around me
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:37.140]   And the Word of God all it does is it feeds me to better see the sins of other people
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:43.600]   First and foremost the law was given to reveal sin
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:52.260]   When Paul met Christ for three days, can you imagine he was blind at Damascus and he was thinking all his life
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:57.600]   People think that he met Christ in his early 30s all his life
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:04.080]   He tried to keep the law perfectly and by his own definition. He said in comparison to other Jews
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.760]   he said he was perfect when it came to the law a Pharisee among Pharisees a Benjamite and
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.160]   Yet his eyes become open
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:19.920]   When Jesus throws him off of his horse and all of a sudden he sees the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.640]   And what was his confession in Philippians 3 in?
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.800]   light of seeing Christ
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.880]   Every righteous thing that I pursued became dumb
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:37.000]   Every measure that I measured righteousness in was dumb
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:47.120]   What I thought was giving me life actually was condemning me that's what Paul means here I
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:56.400]   Pursued it thinking there was life there, but I was deceived and all it did was bring death
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.880]   First and foremost
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:07.960]   Are we under when we open up the Word of God when the Word of God is taught
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.960]   Does it function the way God intended it to
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.040]   To bring us to our knees
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:21.400]   Not like the Pharisees thank God. I'm not like those people I paid tithes and I go to the temple and I give worship
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.400]   Thank God. I'm not like those sinners
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:30.380]   First and foremost the Word of God comes to make us like that tax collector beating his chest
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:34.040]   I'm a sinner
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.520]   I'm a sinner. I
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:40.520]   Can't come to you by my own strength
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.000]   utterly desperate before God
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.680]   Understanding the condemnation that I deserve
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.280]   for
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.720]   1,500 years the Jews piled up
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.400]   condemnation after condemnation
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:02.440]   Year after year decade after decade century after century. They said amen to this curse and
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.880]   They didn't recognize it
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.880]   And that's why when Jesus said
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:13.600]   Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. He can't be talking about me
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.600]   I
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.680]   Can see why he's saying to those people but not me
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:26.080]   If the Word of God does not humble us you've missed the whole point
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:30.920]   If the Word of God does not break us you've missed the whole point
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.960]   It brings us to our knees
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.120]   so the natural question is
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.680]   Then it's the law evil
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:45.200]   Did God give us the law does that mean that God doesn't expect us to keep the law if that all the law did was to
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.000]   reveal sins
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.400]   Does that mean that we just thank God that you say this by grace and you just kind of go on and living?
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.400]   By no means
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:00.520]   Romans 3 31 do we then overthrow the law by this faith by no means on the contrary we uphold the law
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.520]   It wasn't the law
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:07.440]   All the law did was reveal what was dormant in us if the law is not sin
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.680]   In fact, what does he say? The law is holy the commandment is holy and righteous and good
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.200]   Does God desire to live righteously?
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.840]   Absolutely
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.360]   Should we be holy?
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:24.220]   Absolutely. The problem with the Jews was that they thought that somehow they were going to be righteous through the law
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.400]   It is not the law. That was the problem
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:31.920]   It was a sin that was dormant in them that they did not recognize through the law
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.600]   Let me wrap up this morning with this
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.040]   Because I want us to see
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:45.760]   How Paul is trying so hard to change the paradigm of a Jew who had one way of thinking about righteousness
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.160]   And then now he's flipping the table. I
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:52.200]   Mean think about that in the early church
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.080]   These Pharisees who lived hundreds of years generation after generation
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:03.840]   Thinking that they were righteous and all of a sudden the church is established and you have tax collectors teaching them about righteousness
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:12.360]   You have fishermen who are deacons and elders in the church leading the church while these ex-pharisees and even Sadducees are sitting there
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:19.960]   Listening to these fishermen exposit the scripture to them the scripture that they had PhDs in and all of a sudden
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.760]   They flipped the script
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.840]   And how difficult it must have been for them
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:28.680]   See it wasn't the law
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.800]   It was that the law didn't humble them
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.800]   So all didn't break them it made them self-righteous and it deceived them thinking that there was life no the law is good
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.320]   It is righteous
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.320]   Let me describe
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:47.160]   What I believe the scripture teaches and how do we measure
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.760]   spiritual maturity someone who's near to God
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:55.920]   First the sign of spiritual maturity is a brokenness over his own sins
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:01.520]   Not someone who's broken over the sin of our generation our nation our church or anybody around us
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.880]   not even over our husband and wife or children first and foremost a
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:12.280]   maturing Christian is a Christian who is broken over his own sins because he is in front of the Word of God and
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.080]   It's constantly revealing
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:19.520]   The corruption in his own heart and so he's broken over it
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.640]   And not only is he broken over it as a result
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.560]   He is humble
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.560]   He is humble because he knows
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:33.000]   That because of his brokenness that the only way that he could have been saved was by the grace of God and he recognizes
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.040]   That he is where he is because by grace and gross grace alone, so it humbles him
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:42.480]   see pride in the gospel is a contradiction a
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.160]   Man who's been saved by the grace of God cannot be proud
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:51.200]   By very definition you got what you didn't deserve
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.760]   So it humbles him but thirdly
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:03.160]   He has compassion and not disdain for those who are not yet delivered a
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:09.840]   man who's been drowning and a lifeboat comes and grabs him from the shoulder and
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:16.080]   Yanks him on the boat does not sit on that boat pointing at other people who are not saved and say you fools
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.000]   Why couldn't you be saved like me
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.360]   See that's a contradiction you would automatically think that that guy doesn't recognize what just happened
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.760]   we were dead in our trespasses and
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:34.920]   Christ the Son of God came and yanked us from our death and made us alive
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:40.840]   So how can we be sitting on the boat and looking at other sinners and condemning them?
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:45.000]   Instead if we really recognize what it is in us
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.920]   It will lead to compassion
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.400]   True spiritual maturity is brokenness
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.640]   humility and
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.120]   compassion which compels us to holiness
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.160]   Which compels us to holiness?
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:07.680]   See the whole system that the Pharisees created was flipped upside down
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.160]   Now
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.600]   We can look at that and say well, we're not Jews we don't have the Mosaic law
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.520]   We don't have the temple so that doesn't apply to us. No it applies to us
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:23.560]   Think of the way that we measure righteousness
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.680]   Think of the way that we pursue God
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:34.200]   When you read the scriptures do quiet times I did quite I
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.840]   Pray I evangelized I gave
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:44.640]   And yet very purpose of quiet time is to break us
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:49.760]   Humble us to humiliate us a
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.840]   Growing Christian is a Christian who is constantly repenting and celebrating
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.040]   Because of his life he's given to us
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.000]   Amen
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.920]   It's such a simple truth
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:11.440]   It's such a simple truth and it's so foundational to everything that we know of Christianity
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.600]   And yet if we get this wrong, we miss the whole point
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.680]   Let's take some time to pray as we come before the Lord
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.360]   Every single one of us is susceptible to Pharisees
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:27.760]   When we're filled with self-righteousness
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.680]   When we see other people's sin is more hideous than ours
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.440]   We're guilty
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:40.720]   Let the Word of God reveal the thoughts and intentions of your heart
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:47.240]   The passages that you've read the quiet times that you've done the Bible study
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.680]   What has that revealed about where you stand before God?
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.400]   And if you're convicted, we are not without hope
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.520]   The point of it is not simply to condemn us
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:03.200]   But in our condemnation to remind us that we have hope in Christ and Christ alone
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:08.640]   So let's take this time as we come before the Lord and as we are convicted to come before the Lord and thank him
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.800]   For his salvation. Let's pray
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.140]   (sizzling)
