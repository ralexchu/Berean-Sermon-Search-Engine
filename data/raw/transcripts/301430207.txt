[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.680]   As you guys know, we're in the last chapter of the book of Leviticus, chapter 27.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.140]   I'm not going to ask you how many of you actually studied 27 before you came, because I don't
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.720]   want to be overly encouraged.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.160]   But if you did read it, if you did study it, you probably came kind of confused.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.120]   Maybe one of the first questions that you asked was, "Why does the book of Leviticus
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.400]   end with this?"
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.240]   And those of you who make absolutely no expression, I'm assuming it's because you don't know.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:46.160]   So if you did read it, you probably was thinking, "Wow, that's a really strange way to finish
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.400]   the book of Leviticus."
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.760]   There is a purpose behind that, and again, and hopefully through our study that we'll
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.160]   be able to glean from that.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.400]   Some of you guys know, I just came back from Hawaii.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.760]   I know I don't have a tan because I'm already dark as it is, but I had to attend a wedding
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.360]   this weekend and I just came back yesterday.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.320]   And the whole time I was there in Hawaii, I was thinking, "How do Christians stay sober
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.320]   here?"
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.240]   Because the whole environment is vacation, and it's just relaxed, and the whole theme
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.600]   is just take it easy, Shakabra, mahalo, and then even their formal attire is kind of like
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.040]   it's casual.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.600]   And I was just thinking to myself, "How do people stay spiritually sober and live with
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.960]   a sense of urgency and pray with desperation when all your environment constantly tells
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.000]   you to just relax?"
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.400]   But then I was also thinking, "That's not just true in Hawaii.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.820]   If we allow our environment to dictate our spiritual condition, it is no safer here than
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.160]   it is in Hawaii.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.200]   It is no safer in LA or anywhere else we live because if you're dependent upon anything
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.500]   external to determine how focused you are spiritually, you will always be spiritual
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.680]   infants being tossed here and fro depending upon what comes into town and who you meet
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.360]   with and what happens to be the environment that you live in.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.960]   You and I happen to live in Orange County where we are relaxed.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.320]   We may not be as extreme as Hawaii, but everything around us basically tells us everything is
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.320]   good.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.600]   There is nothing desperate.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.240]   And I got an email from India, from one of our Indian pastors, because they heard about
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   the fire.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.400]   And, you know, obviously it's a huge news across, and they emailed me, worried about
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.960]   me, worried about us.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.320]   "Hey, are you guys okay in the fire?"
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.280]   You know, I said, "Hey, worry about yourself.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.280]   We're doing fine.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.280]   You know, everything is okay."
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.000]   It's obviously there are people who are being deeply affected by what's happening.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.720]   But for us in Orange County, you know, we're doing okay.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.680]   The reason I want to share this is because the fight that you guys are, you and I are
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.720]   in to stay sober on a day-to-day basis, that is not something that you do once a year when
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.120]   you go to retreats or when you go to, you know, when you go to like Mission Field or
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.000]   when you have special events.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.320]   If that is not your daily fight to keep sober, you will lose.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.440]   You will live lukewarm life, just kind of being tossed back and forth, and you wait
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.560]   until somebody gets up on the pulpit or maybe your small group leader to say, "Hey, get
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.560]   back on track."
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.820]   But as soon as that person is no longer in your life, you start to drift.
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.200]   And I've seen that so many times over and over again throughout the years, where people
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.340]   are great as long as they're with certain people in certain environment.
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.040]   But as soon as they are separated from that environment, they just start drifting out.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.520]   Next thing you know, a year, two years, five years down the line, these same people who
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.840]   are passionate for God are no longer walking with God.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.400]   And every single one of us is susceptible to that.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.520]   So the reason why, again, I share this is why a careful study of the Word of God is
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.200]   so important because it stimulates our mind, it stimulates our heart, and reminds us of
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.160]   the spiritual reality that you and I are living in, right?
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.800]   You and I are here because we believe, we have faith, that there is more to this life
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.720]   than what you eat and drink, right?
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.040]   The job that you have, the getting married and having kids, and then eventually getting
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.720]   old and die, we believe that there's much more to life than that.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.400]   And that's why you come to church.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.480]   That's why you come to Bible study.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.240]   And so in the context of studying the Scriptures, we have to ask ourselves, are we living, being
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.480]   spiritually sober, being reminded of the spiritual reality, or is this just something that happens
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.960]   every once in a while because you come to church, right?
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.120]   And so, again, I want to remind you and encourage you that if you, even in just this week, if
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.840]   you saw your heart and your mind tripped on to something and you're just kind of coasting
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.920]   along, that use the opportunity that we have together, right?
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.600]   Consider how to spur one another on toward love and good deeds, especially as you see
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.800]   the day drawing near, as the days are getting colder and that the love for God is, at least
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.320]   around us, is getting colder, that we do not fall into that same temptation, okay?
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.920]   So let me pray for us and we'll jump in.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.720]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you for this evening.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.680]   We thank you for the fellowship of the brothers and sisters.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.960]   Lord, as we live in this world and knowing, Father God, that we are not of this world,
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:36.120]   how easily we forget from day to day, Father God, that our destiny is in a different place.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.000]   Help us not to envy this world that is under your condemnation.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.400]   Help us to have mercy, compassion for them, that we would live sober lives, Lord God,
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.840]   to shine the light that you've given us, that for their sake, help us, Lord God, to really
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.640]   live worthy of the gospel.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.800]   We thank you, Father, and we ask that you would bless this time.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.100]   All right.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:08.640]   So the Bible study that we're having in chapter 27, Leviticus, as you guys know, began with
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.840]   the instruction of how sinful people can approach a holy God through the sacrifices, right?
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.660]   So the first five chapters basically lays out, if you want God to be in your midst,
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.520]   this is what you need to do, right?
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.620]   And obviously, ultimately points to the fulfillment of Christ's sacrifice in us.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:32.380]   If we're going to restore the relationship that was broken with God, unless we're covered
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.300]   by the blood of Christ, he cannot dwell among us, right?
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.780]   God and sin cannot be in the same place.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.320]   So there has to be something done about the sin.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.500]   And so that's what the tabernacle was for.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.700]   Tabernacle was a place where animals were sacrificed to cover the sins of mankind, right?
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.620]   And that's how it starts.
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.940]   And so all of Leviticus are specific instructions of how to approach God, how sinful people
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.740]   can approach God and how he can stay in their midst.
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.900]   Chapter 27 ends with instruction how sinful people can maintain their relationship with
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.620]   the holy God, right?
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.820]   Through these vows that they have made and the ones that they could not keep.
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:21.100]   And basically he's outlining how to redeem vows that they could not keep.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:28.540]   Now for chapter 27 to make any sense, you have to understand what the vows meant.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.900]   Because today when we say vows, we naturally just think promises, right?
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.740]   I promise to do something.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.120]   But in our culture, promises are just words, right?
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.180]   You never go into business based upon somebody's promise.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.780]   I promise that 50% of a promise I'm going to give to you, right?
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:53.220]   I promise that if you allow me to use the car, I'll bring it back safe and then if I
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.820]   damage it, I promise I'll give it to you.
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.940]   That's not enough, right?
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.740]   Where we live, you have to get into a contract and then you have to spell out what the promise
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.240]   is and then these are the consequences and you have to give a deposit and if you break
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:13.100]   this promise that you have a third party that's going to make sure that this happens, right?
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.120]   And so until then, we don't feel safe.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:21.900]   So when the Old Testament, especially in Leviticus, when it talks about oath, we have to understand
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.860]   it as beyond just how you and I use promises, right?
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:37.220]   In the oral tradition, a vow was just as binding as a signed contract in our day, right?
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.620]   So he's not just talking about somebody who just kind of said, "Hey, I promise I'm going
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:47.660]   to do this," and it has much heavier weight and maybe equivalent to us signing a formal
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:53.100]   contract, maybe a covenant between a husband and wife and then they signed a contract,
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:58.380]   they filed it into the city and then they become legal, right?
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.500]   And so that's what a vow was in the oral tradition.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.100]   It was a commitment that they made and they took that very, very seriously.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:10.660]   In fact, Deuteronomy 23, 21 to 23, it says, "When you make a vow to the Lord your God,
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:15.400]   you shall not delay to pay it for it would be sin in you and the Lord your God will surely
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   require it."
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.300]   It's not just somebody saying, "Hey, that guy made a promise and he's not faithful,"
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.300]   right?
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.300]   And that's what we would say.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.500]   He says, "No, it's sin.
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.260]   If you made a vow, you made a promise and you don't fulfill it, it was considered sin.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.780]   However, if you refrain from vowing, it would not be a sin to you," right?
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:37.540]   So much of what chapter 27 is talking about is voluntary vows that he makes.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.500]   And we'll talk about in what context these vows were made.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.100]   "You shall be careful to perform what goes out from your lips just as you have voluntarily
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.500]   vowed to the Lord your God what you have promised."
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.620]   So in other words, to take the vow seriously.
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.180]   Don't flippantly say in your mouth that, "God, I'm going to do this," or, "I'm going to dedicate
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.860]   this," because once you have done that, it's binding.
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.020]   It's not like us just kind of flipping, say, "Hey, I'll do this.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.980]   If you do this for me, I'll be there," and then you break that promise.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.780]   It's like, "Oh, you know, I'll do it next time for sure," right?
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.060]   You say, "Oh, that guy's not faithful."
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.700]   Old Testament says, "If you make that promise, if you made that vow and you break it, it's
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.860]   sin," right?
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.860]   And there were consequences for that.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.320]   So don't say things rashly, right?
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:27.340]   And that's the context in which chapter 27 is written.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.700]   This is for making a vow.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.500]   When someone wanted to demonstrate his love for the Lord out of gratitude, and this is
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.400]   directly linked to what we saw in chapter 26, right?
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.380]   And what was chapter 26?
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:48.500]   God's promises of blessing in obedience and God's promise of curse in disobedience, right?
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:56.980]   So chapter 26 may bring God's judgment upon them because they didn't obey, and as a result
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:02.140]   of that, maybe they pled with God, or maybe they were obedient and God allowed the rain
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.640]   to come and they had abundance of crops.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.860]   And as a result of that, a response to what God has done, they're giving an offering of
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.900]   thanksgiving, right?
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.140]   And so in that context, you say, "God, I thank you so much for what you did.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.740]   I'm going to dedicate myself to you for the next year," or, "I'm going to give my first-born
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.580]   child to you for your service."
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:29.140]   So a vow would have been made in that context of an abundance of gratitude in response to
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:33.180]   what God has done.
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.660]   Oftentimes, and this is probably the most common vows that people make, prayers to be
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.740]   answered.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:47.980]   And we see examples of that, of Jacob in Genesis 28, where he pleads with God and he vows that
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.740]   if God blesses him, that he was going to do this and that.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:56.820]   Remember Jephthah in Judges 11, that if God gives him victory, that he was going to dedicate
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.820]   his daughter.
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.140]   Hannah, praise to God, if you give me a son, I'll dedicate him to you.
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:07.300]   Jonah, if you protect us from this disaster, that I'm going to repent and go back and do
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.640]   what you tell me to do.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.420]   So the most common vow was made was kind of a negotiating with God.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.060]   "God, I will do this if you do this for me," right?
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.660]   That's probably the most common vow that we see.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:24.180]   And oftentimes, again, even today, people may pray that, "Lord, if you just let me get
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.260]   into this school, I will serve you.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.220]   If you let me get this job, I'm going to use this money to honor you.
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.740]   If you allow this to happen, I'm going to do this."
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:38.900]   And so you would make a vow, a promise that you're going to do that.
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.980]   And you probably heard testimonies of people who came into ministry that way.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:48.700]   And the person that came to mind for me was Dawson Trotman.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.980]   Some of you guys may know who he is.
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.500]   He's the founder of Navigators Ministry.
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.660]   And he made a vow like that because he got...
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.620]   I forgot what the context was, but he was desperate and he prayed to God that, "If you
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.500]   save me from this, I will serve you."
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.420]   And then God surely delivers him.
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.900]   And then as a result of that, he gave his life to serve God.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.820]   And then he started this ministry called the Navigators, right?
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:14.500]   And so that was the second, most common context in which a vow was made.
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.500]   Another vow is a Nazirite vow.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:22.980]   And this was a vow that, if you remember, Samson made when he was young.
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:27.780]   It was to completely be detached from any kind of alcohol, right?
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:32.780]   And then he lived with certain boundaries as a way of dedicating, asking for the Lord's
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.900]   favor upon his life as a result of that.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:40.660]   So he made a Nazirite vow.
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.300]   And this was a dedication of his whole life to be used by God in a certain way.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.100]   And obviously, God uses him at the end.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.260]   I mean, he was a shady guy, but God...
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.200]   I have a feeling that he broke that Nazirite vow over and over again, right?
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.000]   But at least that was a vow of the Nazirites.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.740]   So that's the context.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.900]   These three reasons are not comprehensive, but these are the most common reasons why
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:08.300]   an Old Testament Jew would have entered into a certain kind of vow.
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:14.380]   And it is in this vow, he says, if you have made this vow, that vow is binding.
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.460]   You don't say it, right?
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.340]   Under a covenant relationship with this holy God, you don't come to God flippantly and
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.440]   say, "God, if you do this, I'm going to do this."
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.900]   And then three months later, say, "Ah, you know how I am."
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.900]   Right?
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.700]   It's like, "You know me."
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.700]   Right?
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:29.700]   That's not going to work.
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.700]   Right?
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:36.940]   So, the whole thing about the book of Leviticus is recognizing who he is.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.540]   The very first offering that was given to God, they didn't follow his instruction, and
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.900]   as a result of that, what happens?
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.900]   Capital punishment.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.900]   They die.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.700]   And what is the lesson that was taught to the nation of Israel?
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.360]   God is holy, holy, holy.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.020]   You cannot just approach him any way you want.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.020]   Right?
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:57.340]   And so in chapter 27, even in the promises that we make God, you don't flippantly make
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.780]   promises to God and not fulfill it.
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.020]   God takes that seriously because he's a holy God.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.020]   Right?
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.260]   And so he says, "When you have made these vows," right?
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:14.260]   The purpose of this chapter is to give a person who made a rash vow or a difficult vow.
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.140]   That's how it is used.
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.140]   Right?
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.060]   In the first few verses.
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:26.020]   Someone who made a rash or a difficult vow that he is not able to fulfill, right?
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.060]   Or maybe it is difficult for him to fulfill.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.360]   God gave him an opportunity to redeem that vow.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.520]   He wasn't just going to say, "Okay, forget it.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.520]   That was rash."
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.820]   He says, "No, you need to rectify that."
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.620]   And that's what this whole chapter is about.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.900]   Someone who's made a difficult vow who cannot fulfill it, and God's giving them an opportunity
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.460]   to redeem that.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.460]   Right?
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.740]   So that's what chapter 27 is about.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:58.420]   So again, if you don't understand the context of this, it's like, "Wow, he's actually saying
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.220]   that guy's worth $30, this guy's worth $50, that guy's worth $25."
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.740]   I mean, you talk about being offensive.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.560]   If you don't understand the context, right?
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:13.020]   You can see some modern feminist reading this and you thought women shouldn't teach publicly
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.020]   was offensive.
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.020]   Right?
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.300]   Some of you guys give me blank looks like you have absolutely no idea what I'm talking
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.300]   about.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.300]   Right?
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:26.180]   But for those of you who did read it and studied it, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.460]   Okay?
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.940]   Chapter 1 through 24 is in reference to the voluntary vow.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:36.500]   These are vows that were not required, that they made some rash vow or a difficult vow,
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.340]   and God gives them an opportunity to redeem it.
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.340]   So the laws on vowing people as holy to the Lord.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.340]   Holy to the Lord.
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.460]   What does it mean to be holy to the Lord?
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.460]   To be set apart.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.060]   That you've taken a common object and you set it apart.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.300]   So what set them apart?
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.300]   The vow.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:59.180]   They didn't physically do it, but the moment you made that vow, that person became set
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.180]   apart.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.300]   It was as good as it was God's.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.300]   Right?
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:08.020]   So it wasn't like, "Oh, he went through this ritual and then he went through the temple
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.980]   and he was offered up, put up special clothes, and then he was separated."
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.300]   He said, "The moment you made that vow, it was set apart for God.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.300]   That belonged to God.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.100]   He may not have physically gone there, but that belongs to God."
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:25.020]   So somebody who makes this vow in verses 1-3, God allows one who made the difficult vows
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.900]   to redeem what he had vowed monetarily.
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:34.560]   And that's where the pricing comes from.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.700]   He says you have to use the sanctuary shekels.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.900]   The weight of the sanctuary shekels.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.340]   In other words, obviously the way that they counted money, it wasn't like today where
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.180]   it's just print and then the government makes sure that it's genuine.
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.180]   And as long as it's genuine, it's worth $5, $10, $20.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.980]   At that time, you can easily fool people by using false weights.
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.700]   Right?
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.980]   So the way that oftentimes in the Bible, we're talking about dishonest weights, that instead
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:08.900]   of five pounds, you would use four pounds or eight pounds, and then you can cheat somebody
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.660]   out of a pound or two by using false weights.
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.900]   But in order to make sure that that doesn't happen, he says that the price needs to be
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:21.180]   weighed by the weights that was held at the tabernacle.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.700]   In other words, it's consistent.
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.700]   Right?
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.940]   Just to give you an idea of what a shekel is, a shekel is equivalent to a month's income
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:33.180]   for a worker.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.740]   So keep that in mind.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.420]   And this is just an average.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.580]   Some rich people made more than that, poor people made less than that.
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:45.660]   But on the average, an average worker's income, a month's income, was one shekel.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:51.780]   So based on that, this is the redemption value of somebody who makes this vow, and in order
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.060]   to redeem them monetarily.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.400]   And here's the chart.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.980]   So if you're between one month to five years, and you happen to be a male, it's five shekels,
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:07.740]   meaning five months worth of work.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.340]   If you happen to be a female, it was three months.
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.980]   Hold your anger for the time being, okay?
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.940]   We'll explain in a little bit.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:22.980]   If you happen to be five to 20 years old, your value as a male is 20 shekels.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.460]   If you're a female, it's half that, 10 shekels.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.660]   If you're between the age of 20 and 60, you have the most value.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:36.220]   If you're a male, you're 50 shekels, which is equivalent to, what, about four, a little
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.180]   bit over four years, right?
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.180]   Four years of salary.
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:47.700]   So imagine just average income of somebody, right, in Orange County, right?
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:54.660]   $400,000 or $100,000 or $50,000 or whatever your income level may be, it was four years
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.740]   of that, would have been equivalent to one human being, right?
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:04.740]   So an average income, somewhere around $300,000 to $400,000, right?
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.260]   If you happen to be a male between the age of 20 and 60.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:12.420]   If you happen to be a female, it would have been about three, 30, so less than three years
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.860]   of income, okay?
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:20.500]   If you're 60 and over, if you're a male, it would have been 15, or if you're a female,
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.500]   10 shekels.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.380]   Now, when you read that, again, if you don't understand the context and what he's doing
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:30.020]   here, it just sounds like God's valuing people, that God looks at certain people and says,
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.580]   "You're more valued because you're a male between the age of 20 and 60.
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.180]   You're less valued because you're a female," right?
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:44.460]   In fact, the valuation, what he's doing here in chapter 27 is very, very practical because
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.040]   it's not based upon the intrinsic value of the individual.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.060]   We know all throughout scripture, God speaks against that, right?
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:57.740]   In the kingdom of God, there is no male or female, and we know consistently all throughout
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:02.980]   the Old Testament, New Testament, that God loves men, women, especially those who are
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.540]   orphans and widows, who are helpless, right?
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.660]   What he's doing here is very practical.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.700]   The value of the ages and gender was directly related to the ability to labor in the fields,
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.900]   how much they are able to produce by their labor.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.100]   So if you're an infant between the age of one and five, you have to invest many years
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.500]   of taking care of that child before he's able to produce anything.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.340]   So it was strictly business, monetarily.
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:35.300]   So if a male dedicated himself at the age of 20, saying that, "I belong to the Lord,"
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:39.700]   that male is able to go out to the field and do hard labor and is able to produce a certain
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.540]   amount of income because it's strictly based upon a physical labor, right?
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.140]   There's no intelligence, there's no education, like none of that is involved.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:54.340]   It's just strictly you go out to the field and how many cows can you direct, like how
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:59.540]   big of jars can you bring back home, how much water can you pull and bring back home.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:05.780]   So it was all strictly based upon how much you can produce through physical labor, right?
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.460]   Because it was directly linked to the vow that that person made.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:14.740]   So if that person is, that if he kept his vow, was able to produce this much, he's
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.700]   valued that much, that much must be compensated.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.700]   You understand?
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.860]   So he's not necessarily saying intrinsically male have more value and women don't have
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:24.860]   as much value.
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:30.180]   He's talking about financially what they're able to produce, right?
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:35.060]   If a person was too poor to pay the shekels, the priest would assess what he is able to
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.860]   afford and pay that amount.
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:43.500]   So again, think about if God was just being a chauvinist and saying like, "Male are
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:49.500]   much more valued to me than females," why does he even care about the poor, right?
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.580]   It's inconsistent with his nature.
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.260]   He is talking about financially.
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:02.380]   You made a $80,000 commitment, so you need to compensate $80,000 worth.
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.660]   So that was all.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.540]   He's giving opportunity for them to redeem a vow that they made that for whatever the
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:12.020]   reason they could not keep, so this is what you do, this is how much you have to pay.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:21.100]   The second section, within that section, if you, that was all valuation for humans versus
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:28.820]   9-13, these are vows that they made for the animals that they gave, right?
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.580]   If the animal's vows were ceremonially clean, it is not allowed to be exchanged with another
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.620]   animal that is unclean because it wouldn't be the same amount.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.420]   Does that make sense?
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:44.140]   So this prevented someone from regretting the vows they've made and giving God what
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.640]   is bad for what is good.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:52.320]   So the clean animal would have been worth a lot more than the unclean animal, right?
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.720]   So he's talking financially.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.640]   So you can't make a vow and say, "You know what?
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.640]   I'm going to give you a year," and then after your emotions die down, he's like, "Maybe
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.640]   a year is too much.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.080]   I'll give you three months."
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.840]   So you can't renegotiate.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.280]   The moment you make the vow, it's binding.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.680]   It's the Lord's, even though you didn't give it to him yet.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.720]   So he says, "Therefore, if you renege on that, you're stealing from God."
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.760]   That's the point of all of this.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.760]   So no cheap substitute.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.080]   So once a vow is made, it is complete.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.960]   There's no stage one, there's no stage two, there's no stage three.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:35.040]   Once the vow is made, it's the Lord's, right?
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.440]   So same thing with us as Christians.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.520]   There are no level one Christian, level two Christian, level three Christian.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   There are no people who are of greater value to our Heavenly Father because you're doing
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.160]   more things for God or maybe you have a position in the church.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:56.460]   There's every single child of God is equally valued to the Father.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.240]   Ask any parent who has multiple children, right?
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.400]   Every single one of them are precious to them.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:08.400]   And in the same way, so are everyone else, right?
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.860]   So once we make the vow, it's the Lord's, right?
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.160]   God has purchased and redeemed us.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.040]   All of us belong to God equally.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:23.800]   In fact, in Malachi 1.14, one of the problems of the nation of Israel was they kept on doing
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   this.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.640]   They would make a vow of one thing and then give him the cheaper version.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:34.060]   "Curse is the swindler who has a male in his flock and vows it, but sacrifices a blemished
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:38.000]   animal to the Lord, for I am a great king," says the Lord of Hosts, "and my name is
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   feared among the nations."
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.840]   In other words, remember he says previously, he says, "Would you do this for another
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.840]   king?
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.760]   But why would you do this to the Lord?
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.120]   Would you give cheap offerings and try to swindle him?
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.040]   But why do you keep doing this to the Lord?"
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.040]   Right?
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:57.320]   In other words, because I've been gracious to you, right?
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.040]   Instead of having greater honor and greater respect and greater reverence and greater
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.400]   fear for him, but because he's been gracious, you take advantage of him.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.600]   And that's why the judgment is coming, right?
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.560]   And that was one of the problems of the nation of Israel, because God's been gracious,
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.240]   they were taking advantage of him.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.440]   And then finally God says, "It's enough."
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:25.200]   What king would tolerate what you are doing to me?
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:30.400]   If the vowed animal was ceremonially unclean, it is to be rejected as an offering, but could
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.320]   still be given to a tabernacle for the priest.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.080]   In other words, you can't give it to, you can't vow it for the purpose of sacrifice
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.120]   because it won't be accepted.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.680]   But if you were to redeem it, you'd have to take that unclean animal and add a fifth.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.840]   Remember the guilt offering?
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.920]   If you damage someone else's good or stole by accident, that you have to give that back
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.640]   and add a fifth.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:57.120]   So if somebody made a vow of an animal and you wanted to redeem it back, and I kept on
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.400]   thinking in what context would somebody offer up an animal and decide, "You know, I'm going
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.640]   to save this animal and give the worth of that animal plus a fifth."
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.720]   You'd have to be really attached to that sheep.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.880]   You love that sheep.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:16.800]   I don't know what context, but he says if you choose to do that for whatever the context
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.880]   is, then you'd have to add the fifth.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.680]   There's no examples of that in the Bible.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:31.600]   I can't think of a specific example or even an imaginary context where somebody would
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.720]   be willing to pay the extra fifth to redeem an animal that you were going to slaughter
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.720]   anyway.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.000]   Anyway, that was just kind of a side thinking.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.440]   I just couldn't figure this out, but it's in here.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:49.320]   If the one who vowed chose to redeem the animal, I already said that, add a fifth to the price
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.320]   in exchange for it.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.320]   So add a fifth.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.320]   You don't have to write all that.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:02.040]   Just say add a fifth.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.680]   Laws on dedicating the house.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:09.200]   If you made a vow, "Lord, if you answer my prayer, I'm going to give you this house,"
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.560]   he said, "If the house that was dedicated was to be redeemed, the priest would need
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.640]   to value it and add a fifth."
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.880]   So the priest functioned as a realtor or a—what do you call it?
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.880]   An assessor?
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   Appraiser, yes.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:30.760]   So he would function as an appraiser and appraise the property and then say it's worth $40,000,
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.040]   and then you would add another fifth to that.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.640]   So again, maybe you grew up in that home.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.480]   Maybe it has some sentimental value.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.760]   Maybe there's something attached to this home.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.840]   Maybe your parents lived there for generations.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:47.120]   Whatever the reason, if you made a difficult vow and you need to redeem it, he says, "You
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:53.320]   need to pay that plus a fifth."
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.280]   Laws on dedicating the land.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.240]   And I'm just going to read that.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:03.600]   Since priests did not have time to care for land dedicated as holy, the owners retained
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.320]   control of it until the year of Jubilee and made a living from it.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:12.120]   Ideally, they would redeem the land before the Jubilee, paying the price that held as
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.840]   of that day they had dedicated it and adding a fifth.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.840]   So same principle.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:23.080]   If you dedicated the land and if you wanted to redeem it, and then if you had—that's
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   what would happen.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.160]   If they failed to redeem it or if they leased it during the time, they forfeited it and
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.760]   it became priestly property.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.080]   And all of these things, you're probably not going to remember.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:37.880]   All of this is once you've dedicated it, it's the Lord's.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.880]   That's the running theme.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.880]   These are just the details.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.880]   So I'm going to just kind of go through it quickly.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:54.120]   Chapter 25 to 34 is talking about non-voluntary offerings, non-redeemable people or objects.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:30:00.720]   These are things that if you've made a vow or that you cannot redeem it or you can't
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.040]   make a vow with this to begin with.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.960]   And the reason mainly is because it already belongs to the Lord.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.920]   First among the animals were not to be consecrated since it belonged to the Lord already, verse
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.040]   26.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:18.000]   So you can't vow to the Lord, "Lord, I vow, I tithe to you."
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.760]   So you can't vow that.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.560]   That's already a given because that was commanded.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.600]   That's not a vow.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.960]   "Lord, if you would just answer my prayers, I will obey you."
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:36.840]   No, I'm not going to answer your prayer and you're going to obey me because I told you
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.560]   to do that to begin with.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:43.320]   That's not something that you'd negotiate with because it's already the Lord's.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.400]   You don't negotiate like, "If you just, you know, and then I'll obey you."
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.360]   No, you better obey me first.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.520]   So basically that's what he's saying.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:57.920]   You can't make these vows to God with what God already commanded you to do.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:03.240]   Think about how often as Christians we thought, "I will follow you if you just..."
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.680]   Meaning you already confessed it.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.040]   You're not following him.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.280]   He said, "If you abide in my words and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   it shall be done for you."
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:17.280]   Your very prayers begin with, "I'm not following you, but if you do me a favor, I'll follow
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.920]   you."
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.640]   You've already negated your prayers.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.680]   God already said he's not going to answer you, right?
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.340]   So he's saying these are not things that you can negotiate with because they already belong
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.760]   to the Lord.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:43.280]   If it is an unclean animal, it can be redeemed after adding fifth to the agreed value.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.920]   Anything devoted for destruction.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.400]   The technical term is ban or korban.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.200]   Korban was the name that was used in the Old Testament to describe an object, a person,
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:01.840]   a city, a tribe, whatever it was that God declared to be under the judgment of God.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.000]   So you can't declare something and say, "I'm going to offer it up to you because it's already
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.240]   under God's judgment."
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.600]   All the tithes of the land cannot be redeemed since it is already the Lord's.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:23.760]   But if you were tithing, let's say, you know, like a tenth of your crop, and for whatever
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:28.080]   the reason, you wanted to keep the crop but you still wanted to give the tenth, whatever
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:35.600]   it is that you had vowed, you have to give the amount for that and add a fifth.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.640]   Because a tenth was already the Lord's.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:48.280]   So he gave an option to be able to switch that out monetarily.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.080]   Those are all the technical, right?
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.320]   These are all the technical stuff.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.960]   Remember, when we study the book of Leviticus, you have to ask the question, "Why is this
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.480]   here?
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.800]   What does this have to do with Christ?
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.080]   How does this point to Christ?"
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:09.000]   Because everything from chapter 1 to chapter 27 ultimately kind of give a platform for
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.760]   the crucifixion of Christ and what he did, the shedding of blood, the clean and unclean,
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.480]   God's righteous judgment, and then his grace, all of it, everything that we know of the
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:23.480]   gospel is founded upon what God did through the book of Leviticus.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.980]   So what does this fulfill?
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:31.200]   What does this teach?
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:36.240]   Let me go over a few verses, just to kind of give you a background of what we see in
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.660]   the New Testament related to these vows.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.960]   In Matthew 23, 16, Jesus says, "Woe to you, blind guys, who say, 'Whoever swears by the
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:47.080]   temple, that is nothing, but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.'"
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:54.160]   So he's basically calling them out because they were making vows like they were doing
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.720]   in the Old Testament, but they valued the gold over the temple.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:04.720]   In other words, that reveals their heart, what they thought about God versus what they
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.840]   thought about money.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.400]   So if you vowed the gold, no one wants to, you know, like, "Oh, that's valuable."
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.080]   But the temple doesn't have that kind of value.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:19.480]   The temple, in God's eyes, has much more value than the gold that it's made out of.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:26.960]   So he rebukes them that already, even in the way that you vow, it reveals what you value.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:34.880]   James 5, 12, it says, "But above all, my brethren, do not swear either by heaven or by earth
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.440]   or with any other oath, but you are yes, be yes, and no, be no, so that you may not fall
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.440]   under judgment."
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:47.680]   So in other words, like, if you have to constantly say, "I swear," right, because it's a common
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.680]   practice for you to say things that you don't mean.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.360]   You make promises, appointments, and you break it like that.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.840]   It means nothing.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:58.800]   So after a while, your words don't mean anything.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.560]   And you're frustrated that people don't take you serious because your words don't mean
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.040]   anything, right?
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.120]   You say things flippantly, you do it, you don't do it, and you break it, and you say
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.080]   one thing, and then you do another, and he says, "Don't make that a promise.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.320]   Let your yes be yes, be no, be no."
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:22.480]   In other words, think before you speak, before you make promises, before you make appointments,
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.400]   before you enter into any kind of agreement, right?
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.720]   Make sure that you count the cost, right?
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:34.160]   Think about how many people, like, again, the way that the gospel is preached, you know,
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.480]   it's just like, "Hey, everybody, give Jesus a try.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.160]   What have you got to lose?
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.160]   Just calm down.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.160]   We'll give you a free book.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.920]   We'll give you some counseling."
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.920]   Then why not?
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:51.240]   You know, the worst case scenario, you gain some friends, you know, and you hang out with
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.240]   your age people.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   You can do things together.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.240]   That's the worst case scenario.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.560]   Best case scenario, you get to go to heaven.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.560]   Why not?
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:05.640]   So sometimes the way that the gospel is preached, it kind of takes away any kind of cost involved.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.640]   So people enter into this covenant relationship with God flippantly.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.400]   So because they entered it flippantly, what happens?
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.360]   They exit flippantly, right?
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.420]   When things get hard, when, you know, people disappoint you or the church doesn't act the
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:23.620]   way that you think they ought to act, and it's like, "Okay, I'm gone."
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:27.240]   And part of the reason why there's so many people backsliding is because the way that
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.380]   they came into the kingdom to begin with, right?
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.460]   It wasn't serious to begin with.
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:36.800]   So he's saying, "Let your yes be yes and no be no."
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:42.160]   Like when you say you believe, make sure you mean that, right?
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.200]   Don't say you have faith.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.560]   Don't say that flippantly.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:51.120]   Make sure you believe that because saying that you believe comes with consequences.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.880]   You can't say that you believe the building is burning down and then just sit there and
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.640]   do nothing and then get offended if somebody says, "Maybe you don't believe and that's
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.640]   why you're not running."
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.060]   How dare you question me?
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:05.060]   Who wouldn't question you?
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.380]   Everybody is questioning you.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.460]   It's just that some people choose to say it.
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.460]   Other people are thinking it.
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.380]   They're just not telling you, right?
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.980]   So let your yes be yes, no be no.
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.780]   If you're going to say you have faith, make sure you actually have faith because many
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:24.220]   people will enter into the kingdom professing to know God, but they don't have faith in
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.360]   God, right?
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:30.660]   So it's a warning against taking flippant vows.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:35.280]   In Matthew, Jesus goes even further and says, "And again, you have heard in the ancient
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.400]   that you shall not make false vows, but shall fulfill your vows to the Lord.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:43.060]   But I say to you, make no oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.920]   by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.300]   of the great king.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.300]   Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black, but
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:55.300]   let your statement be yes, yes, no, no.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.420]   Anything beyond these is of evil."
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:03.980]   How many of you had conversations with somebody that may have read this or studied this or
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:08.500]   looked at this and said, "Therefore, God doesn't want us to get into any kind of contract,"
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:13.180]   because that's a form of a vow, right?
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:18.160]   I've had somebody ask me about that because where is the most common place where people
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.300]   take vows?
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.580]   Car dealership at a wedding, right?
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.980]   Every wedding that I've done, two people stand there and they make vows.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.580]   I vow to do this, I vow today.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:39.540]   Is that a compromise of this?
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:46.340]   If you look in the book of Acts, Acts chapter 18, verse 18, and Acts chapter 21, verse 23,
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:50.500]   apostle Paul actually makes vows, okay?
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.060]   So you can explain that and say, "Oh, maybe he was in between, he didn't fully understand,
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:59.380]   he was a young Christian," but we see examples of people making vows.
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.940]   I do not think that this is a prohibition against wedding vows.
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:08.020]   I do not think that this is a prohibition against entering into any kind of public contract,
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.020]   right?
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:12.380]   I don't think God got rid of any kind of contract.
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.820]   Christians are not allowed to enter any kind of vows or contract from this point on.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.980]   I don't think that's what he was saying.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:28.020]   He was specifically arguing against a culture where they made rash vows for what purpose?
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.780]   For self-gain, for personal gain.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:36.180]   So they were entering into contracts with no intention to fulfill it or making promises
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:40.300]   that they don't have the ability to fulfill, right?
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.660]   Then even if they made the vow, they would keep breaking it over and over again.
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:47.900]   He says, "Don't even make vows because you don't understand who you are," right?
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:52.300]   So this is not a prohibition against entering into a vow or any kind of particular contract.
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:58.940]   He's talking about the condition of that person, condition of that generation that
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.940]   was using the vows flippantly for personal gain, right?
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:07.300]   Now what does this have to do with what we're talking about?
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.540]   What does this teach us?
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:12.940]   Let me take four things that we should get out of this.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:20.140]   One, it taught the nation of Israel to take vows seriously.
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:24.060]   That you don't come to God and make flippant promises.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:28.180]   You don't enter into a covenant with God and then exit the covenant and then enter the
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:33.940]   covenant and then exit the covenant at your leisure, right?
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:39.300]   That's why in a marriage vow it says, "What God has put together, let no man separate."
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:43.100]   You don't have the ability to do that, right?
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:47.180]   So in other words, take vows seriously because God takes it seriously.
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.940]   That's the first thing that it taught the nation of Israel.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.500]   God didn't just forget about it and just kind of let it be.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.500]   There has to be.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:58.380]   If you can't physically do it, there needs to be compensation for that, right?
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:03.540]   That's the first thing.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.660]   Second thing is, and again, I don't have slides up here for that.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:11.620]   Man is sinful and is unable to keep the oath that he makes.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.460]   That's why it says difficult vows.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:20.740]   So chapter 27 already assumes that Israel was going to say things that they couldn't
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.060]   fulfill.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:26.900]   So God is giving an opportunity to redeem that, right?
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:30.020]   You made a rash vow and say, "No, I'm going to give my life to serve the Lord," and then
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.660]   you can't do it and he said, "Okay, now you're going to have to compensate for that."
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:39.140]   So take it seriously, but there's an assumption that a sinful man oftentimes is not going
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.300]   to be able to fulfill his vows, right?
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:47.820]   It doesn't mean that God's okay with it, but there's an assumption that the man does not
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:52.660]   have the ability to be faithful to all his vows, right?
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:59.060]   Third, only God is able to keep these vows, right?
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:03.300]   And that's why he demands that we take our vows seriously because God takes his vows
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:09.380]   seriously and what God says he does, right?
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:16.060]   Fourthly, only God can redeem us from a broken vow.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:18.400]   Now why is this here?
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:23.740]   Because he just told the nation of Israel in chapter 26 that if you enter this covenant
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:28.820]   with me and if you obey me, here's the blessing, but if you disobey me, here's all the curses.
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:36.260]   Remember, the curses outnumber by double in Deuteronomy by four times?
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:41.500]   And he said, so basically, Israel's history is a constant breaking of their covenant with
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.500]   God.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:47.980]   So by the time we get to the end of Malachi, they have curses upon curses, vows upon vows
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:53.920]   that they've broken in which they stand condemned under this weight, right?
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:59.920]   And that's why Paul starts in Romans chapter 1, "He who is under the law will be judged
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:00.920]   by the law.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.400]   He who is not under the law will be judged outside the law.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.120]   But what's universal is all is judged."
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:13.360]   The nation of Israel was under the law to reveal to them the utter sinfulness of their
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.520]   sin, right?
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:23.320]   So the whole point of Leviticus is how to have a relationship with this holy God.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:31.240]   And it ends with an assumption that Israel is going to break this vow, right?
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.840]   This is what you ought to do.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.960]   If you want to have a relationship with me, there has to be blood sacrifice.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.680]   You have to be consecrated.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.480]   It needs to be sacred.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.520]   You cannot approach God on your own terms.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.920]   And that was the whole point.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:50.080]   And then chapter 27 ends with, you're going to break these vows and God's going to give
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:55.000]   you an opportunity to be redeemed.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.920]   You understand what chapter, Leviticus ends with chapter 27?
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:05.400]   It ends with redemption despite the sin of man.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:09.600]   Numbers 23, 19, it says, "God is not man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.600]   should repent.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.200]   Has he said and will he not do it?
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:16.440]   Or has he spoken and will he not make it good?"
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.920]   God says it and he's the only one who can fulfill it.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:24.640]   And then the fulfillment of that in 1 Peter 1, 18-19, what he says in Genesis chapter
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:30.120]   3, that I will send the seed of the woman who's going to crush the head of the Satan.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.720]   And then that's the line.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.400]   That's the promise that he makes.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.320]   And then he fulfills that vow in Christ.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.480]   Knowing that you are not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.640]   What is that in reference to?
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.640]   Redemption, right?
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:54.800]   You couldn't redeem with silver or gold man's souls, right?
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.960]   With your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, but with precious blood
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:04.820]   as a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:09.920]   Only Christ can redeem us from broken vows, broken promises.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.000]   And that's what ultimately Leviticus is ultimately about.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.840]   How do we have a relationship with the Holy God?
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.220]   Only someone who has been declared holy in his presence can be in his presence.
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:27.240]   But the problem is we can't attain that holiness no matter how determined we are.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.920]   No matter how sincere we are.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.880]   No matter how disciplined we are.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:34.340]   No matter how educated we are.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.340]   We cannot.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:39.680]   And as a result of that, God gives us redemption.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:44.240]   Not with silver or gold, but by his blood.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.320]   So if you don't understand the context, you can be very offended by chapter 27, but if
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:52.560]   you understand the whole context of the book of Leviticus and the larger context of the
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:57.880]   redemptive history, I mean, Leviticus is a beautiful picture of Christ from beginning
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.960]   to the end, why we needed him.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.760]   And all of this, and the language that it uses, all of this is fulfilled in the New
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:05.760]   Testament.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:11.280]   I don't know about you, but the more I read the Bible, there is no way a human being wrote
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.280]   this.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.280]   It is not possible.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:17.720]   There is nobody that could have been this smart.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:25.360]   And so if you're not meeting Christ in the scriptures, you're not meeting Christ.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.240]   It's all testimonies of testimonies.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:31.640]   Other people who met Christ telling you of what it was like.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:36.800]   I just came back from Hawaii, it's just not the same me telling you the story.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:41.640]   It's just not the same as you going there and seeing it yourself.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:50.800]   That's why if you do not prioritize your walk with God, and you think coming to church every
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.680]   once in a while somehow fulfills that, or hanging around with other Christians, you're
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.480]   sadly mistaken.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:05.480]   There are tons of people who will walk into hell claiming to know Christ when they never
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.840]   really knew him.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.080]   So again, take vows seriously.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:17.840]   If you're going to say you have faith, make sure it's genuine faith, not just check off.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:23.520]   I went down like 20 years ago, I went down some altar call, and that kind of sealed the
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.520]   deal.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.080]   Do you have genuine faith?
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.880]   Do you understand who you are before God?
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.440]   We're sinful men who are not able to earn righteousness.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:39.360]   Do you understand that God and only God can fulfill the promises that he's made?
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:44.280]   And that God and only God can redeem us from our own sins.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:54.120]   And hopefully that message will seep in so deep that it transforms your, not just what
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:48:00.000]   you do, but what you love.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.200]   It utterly transforms your affection.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.880]   That what makes you happy are the things of God.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:12.440]   So the things that you look forward to, not the vacations, not your retirement, and all
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.880]   these things may be great, but they're superficial.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:20.400]   But it actually begins to transform your very desires so that what God wants for you is
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.200]   the very thing that you desire.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:27.640]   And when those two things align, you have life abundant.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.640]   And that's what he means.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.760]   I came to give life and give this life abundantly.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.560]   This is what God wants, but then we want this, and that's where the frustration comes from.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:40.920]   But when we want what he desires for us, we have abundant life.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.840]   So the discussion questions for today.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.040]   Every Christian has entered into a covenant with God to be a faithful follower of Jesus
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.080]   Christ.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:54.040]   How would you assess your oath of following Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.920]   How does God's grace redeem us from our difficult vows affect the way you live your life?
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.920]   Do you take advantage of his grace?
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:06.920]   Where you say, "Well, God's going to forgive me, and he forgives me every time."
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:10.440]   So therefore, you don't see the weight of your sin.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:13.680]   You don't see the weight of your compromise, your lukewarmness.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:19.300]   You can be there year after year after year, but you just say, "Oh, God's gracious."
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:23.680]   Or does that grace cause you to be hungering and thirsting for righteousness, wanting him
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.680]   more?
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:30.880]   Because depending on how you respond to his grace, maybe a revelation of if you're really
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.080]   in that grace or not.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:37.560]   Third, how seriously, and this is very practical and faithful, do you think you are keeping
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.280]   the Berean members covenant?
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.320]   Some of you guys may have forgotten about that.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.920]   We have a tenfold covenant.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.280]   That tenfold covenant is not unique to Berean, even though we use the name Berean.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:51.880]   If you look at the tenfold covenant of our church, these are all things that the Bible
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.720]   commands the Christians to follow.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:50:01.320]   Taking the church, prayer, lordship of Christ, financial stewardship, all that stuff is not
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.320]   unique to Berean.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.840]   We just decided to highlight it, put it as a covenant to make sure for the purpose of
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.760]   discipleship.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.960]   So third question is, again, when we think about vows and living according to what we
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.000]   promise, are we being faithful to those vows?
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.560]   Take a picture of this, and then I'm going to put up the tenfold covenant so that you
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:25.440]   can have that as a reference to look at in your discussion time.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:29.280]   So quickly take a picture.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:33.360]   If you have one of those flip phones, ask somebody.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:38.880]   There's like a few people in our church who still have that, so if you don't, you can
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:39.880]   just ask somebody.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.000]   Okay, I'm assuming you guys took it.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.920]   Okay, and that's the tenfold covenant.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   So let me pray for us, and then I'll have you guys get into your small group.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.800]   Father, we thank you.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.720]   We thank you for our brothers and sisters, where we can run this race together.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:03.320]   I pray, Father God, that as you've implanted so much treasure, Lord God, in this book,
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.320]   we pray for wisdom.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.640]   We pray for hearts, Lord God, that is softened.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.960]   As you are the potter and we are the clay, we truly want to be molded according to what
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.960]   you desire.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:18.840]   I pray that you will bless our small group time, help us to be vulnerable and honest,
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:23.120]   that in our weakness, Lord, that we do not try to be somebody that we're not.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:28.080]   Help us to seek each other, to lean on one another, to be gracious with one another,
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:33.440]   to speak the truth in love, that we will never be comfortable in our sins, but gracious with
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:34.440]   our faults.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:38.000]   So I pray for your blessing, especially for the leaders, Lord God, that you would help
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.040]   them to guide and lead the discussions well.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
