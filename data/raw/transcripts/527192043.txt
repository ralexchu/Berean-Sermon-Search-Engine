[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   It's always so blessed to hear the testimony of a young man of recognizing his state before
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.960]   the Lord and coming to faith.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.640]   Today we're going to be continuing to learn about how powerful that faith is.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.240]   Over the last, in the course of the many weeks, we've been walking through the book of Hebrews
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.180]   and specifically going methodically through chapter 11 on what is faith.
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.040]   And it has been so good to meditate on how powerful, truly powerful that faith is.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.960]   Now the faith that we exercise is so incredibly powerful, not because it's a powerful key,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.040]   as some would say, as though this is a special key you use to turn certain things on or off.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.720]   It's not powerful because through it you end up making giant leaps and bounds.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.720]   But scripture tells us faith is powerful because what God gives to us in the faith is to be
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.720]   able to see what is reality, what is truth.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.080]   And the greatest truth that ever existed is the truth of God, that this is who God is.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.640]   And by knowing Him and seeing Him as He is, then you now have light to everything else.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.320]   You have the light of truth to show you yourself in relationship to this God.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.920]   You have faith to see what the world really is.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.040]   You have faith to see how things fit into the grand scheme as God has made things and
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.440]   so on.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.320]   So as opposed to, let's say, what is perhaps a popular way of thinking about faith is just
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.400]   like this leap into the darkness or leap across a bridge.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.800]   No, no, faith is actually you being able to see God for who He is.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.520]   And that's why it's so powerful.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.840]   And it causes us then to say, "God, I need you.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.840]   I want you."
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.240]   We've been learning about how Jacob, in seeing God's promise, then sees it for what it is
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.040]   and so therefore values it above everything else and pursues it with everything he has,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.080]   right, by being able to see.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.880]   And so today we're going to be talking about that in the book of Matthew chapter 15.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.200]   So please take a moment to turn there.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.160]   We're looking at kind of an interesting story and learning from an unexpected individual
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.760]   character about what it means to have humble faith, a faith that is strong, a faith that
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.080]   is powerful because it helps us to see reality for what it is.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.200]   So let's take a moment to read this passage.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.080]   And the word says, "Jesus went from there and withdrew into the district of Tyre and
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.520]   Sidon.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.400]   And a Canaanite woman from the region came out and began to cry out saying, 'Have mercy
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.780]   on me, Lord, son of David.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.000]   My daughter is cruelly demon-possessed.'
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.600]   But he did not answer her a word.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.120]   And his disciples came and implored him saying, 'Send her away because she keeps shouting
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.120]   at us.'
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.880]   But he answered and said, 'I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.'
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.920]   But she came and began to bow down before him saying, 'Lord, help me.'
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.600]   And he answered and said, 'It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.520]   to the dogs.'
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.220]   But she said, 'Yes, Lord.'
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.920]   But even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their master's table.'
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.000]   Then Jesus said to her, 'O woman, your faith is great.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.800]   It shall be done for you as you wish.'
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.600]   And her daughter was healed at once."
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.360]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your truth.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.080]   And God, we eagerly desire to keep growing in our faith in the way that we see you, Lord,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.320]   that God, it would become more and more accurate and detailed.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.000]   And by doing so, God, I pray we're not just simply learning intellectual facts, but God,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.760]   our hearts and eyes are being changed.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.640]   And Lord, it is to our blessedness, it is to our grace that God, we're able to see you
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.920]   and know you in greater intimacy.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.920]   So we thank you, Lord.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.920]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.920]   Amen.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.920]   Okay.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:21.480]   So, as we take a look at this passage, because we have to kind of jump down into the scene,
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:28.800]   you know, it's Matthew 15, and Jesus has already been doing the work of ministry, of teaching
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.600]   of the kingdom, healing, right?
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.960]   Healing the group that he has, the 12 disciples, and making sure that they're being prepared.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.120]   And what ends up happening is as Jesus is withdrawing, so from the crowds, he's trying
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.560]   to actually get away, okay?
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.800]   He's withdrawing into an arena, and the story already should, if you were like a Jew listening
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.480]   to the story, already be like, "Oh, no," because he's entering into a region where it is all
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.600]   Gentile, right?
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.000]   And according to the customs, so to speak, of the day, you just don't mix.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.360]   And what's more, those specific cities, Tyre and Sinai, they are Canaanite cities, of which
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.320]   you could see them as like arch-nemesis, you know, that kind of stuff.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.520]   The Canaanite people, they were destroyed by the Israelites.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.800]   So Canaanite people were like, "Oh, welcome, friends."
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.400]   Like, they wouldn't be receiving them in that fashion anyway.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.920]   Already there was cultural divide.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.440]   Already there was animosity.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.680]   The history is against them, so to speak.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.280]   So if you're reading, Jesus and the disciples are entering into this region, already you
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.680]   should be thinking, "Oh, that's a no-no."
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.720]   But what's happened here is the story describes then this Canaanite woman, so her lineage
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.560]   is Canaanite, but she is Syrophoenician, meaning she's from this area, she's Greek by culture.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.600]   And most likely, her upbringing, her language, her religion, all that stuff is Greek, pantheons,
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.200]   and et cetera, et cetera, right?
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.240]   But what's interesting is, as we jump down into this scenario then, is you have an unlikely
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:08.800]   individual who is unlikely going to approach a posse or entourage of a high, I guess, profile
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.840]   celebrity, if you will, because news about him is spreading everywhere.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.440]   And you have basically 13 Jewish men trying to go in a secluded region so that they can
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.240]   have time to prepare and et cetera, maybe even have a respite from the ministry that
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.920]   they're doing.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.240]   And this woman comes, desperate.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.640]   This woman comes with cries, with screams and shouts.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:40.080]   And we quickly learn, she says that her daughter is cruelly demon-possessed.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.880]   Originally for some reason, I thought every time I think about a demon-possessed person,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.560]   it's some adult who is out of control, angry, right?
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.720]   Destructive and violent, because that's a lot of times the way the Scriptures has these
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.120]   accounts.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.720]   But the Gospel of Mark adds the detail that this was a child, it was a little daughter.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.960]   And then part of you goes, "Demons," right?
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.160]   Tormenting even little ones.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.880]   But at the same time, we jump into her desperation and we quickly recognize sometimes there's
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.200]   a kind of suffering that goes beyond your own pains.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.080]   This is a kind of desperation where it's for her little baby girl, right?
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.240]   And I quickly, as I thought about this, I remembered our first son, Josiah, when he
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:31.480]   was two, he's now turning 10, but when he was two, we had this incredibly desperate
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.360]   moment where I genuinely felt desperate.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.680]   And it was, he had this high fever that spiked rapidly.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.960]   It went up to about 105, and then he walked into a seizure.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.200]   His knuckles curled up, his eyes rolled back, his face turned blue, his lips turned blue.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.400]   And Bia held and looked at me and said, "He's not breathing."
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   I panicked.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.640]   I started running like back and forth.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.040]   Like I don't know why I ran to the door.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.280]   I opened it, I ran back, I looked at her, grabbed the bag.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.720]   Because what am I supposed to do?
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.680]   Like if your child's not breathing, what are you supposed to do, you know?
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.560]   A lot of you guys who know me, you know I have horrendous memory.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.840]   I can't even remember what I did yesterday.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.760]   But those moments of desperation, it's seared into your brain, right?
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.000]   I can tell you how I felt, where I ran to, what I grabbed, right?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.800]   How I drove, you know, all of that.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:29.320]   Because sometimes in the moments of desperation, especially here, it's kind of inexplicable,
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.160]   right, what you're going to end up doing.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:38.180]   And so maybe we can kind of more humanistically relate to her and say, "We get you, right?
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.000]   We get you that you're suffering here.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.540]   And this is the kind of suffering that's not like you hurt yourself, but a kind of suffering
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.960]   where it truly makes you feel desperate because you know the limitations that you have even
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.960]   as a parent.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.440]   You're going to protect your children, but you know your shield is only so big.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.720]   And clearly you're out of your own element here.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.040]   What are you going to do?
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.840]   Of course you're going to go cry out, right?
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.320]   But here's the thing.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:12.880]   I think falsely we believe that suffering somehow refines and humbles us and grows us.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.720]   No, that's not true.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.100]   I think my own experience in life teaches me that when you're hurt or you go through
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:27.640]   suffering you end up becoming more scabby, somehow hardened.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.460]   The natural human being when faced with difficulty, hardship, and suffering, they typically turn
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.920]   to things like anger, right?
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.860]   What I've seen just trying to help people overcome their suffering and hardships, sadly
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.760]   to say, is that there's a hardening of the heart.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:51.960]   What is actually required to walk through suffering is faith.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.640]   And that's why it was such a, when I said earlier that faith is powerful, it not only
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:03.180]   overcomes the scenario and the suffering, it overcomes the crustiness of your heart
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.620]   in that suffering.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:12.240]   The natural inclination for man is not to come out of suffering greater in benevolence,
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.520]   greater in modesty, greater in humility.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.960]   No.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.160]   Walk with anybody through suffering.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.520]   Walk with anybody who's felt like their back was up against the wall.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.680]   They've already tried everything that was in their power.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.680]   It doesn't just naturally cause humility.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.600]   Humility comes by faith, amen?
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.800]   The work that God is doing in our hearts.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:43.460]   And so the first thing I want to highlight as we see this narrative is that humble faith
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:48.040]   in the midst of desperation requests mercy.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:53.540]   What I mean by that is this woman's faith as we exhibit it in the midst of her desperation
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:58.740]   is leading her to a humble posture of asking.
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:04.080]   Because what I said just a moment ago is that actually if you, through experience of counseling
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:11.740]   or even just experiencing your own life, your temptation in the moment of suffering is rage.
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.820]   You feel justified to rage.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.380]   You feel justified to let it loose.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.680]   And then sometimes not only do you feel justified, you compete with people.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.100]   Do you have any idea the suffering I went through?
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.540]   Hear any of the stereotypical grouchy older people kind of mentality.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:36.060]   I feel like, again, I feel blessed to have lived this life that I've lived.
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:41.520]   But having been, yes, an immigrant, having been through hardships of seeing my parents
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.060]   and having hardships of divorce or my parents going through divorce, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.080]   and all of that.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:54.500]   I feel the temptation to be like, dude, my life is this, this, and this.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.540]   Don't you dare even tell me about your suffering.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.820]   Because that's what the natural heart does in the midst of hardship.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:08.460]   But what I'm trying to sell you is this woman is already being expressed.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.220]   You might say like, what an obvious point to make.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.540]   She asks the question, like, what kind of point is that?
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.260]   But that's a point because what I'm trying to say is every one of us are tempted in the
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.140]   moments of suffering to flee, flight.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.700]   Second is to fight.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:32.420]   But in the desperation, if it's met with a heart of faith, then she is going to ask and
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.820]   request.
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.540]   So if you look at the narrative here, it comes where she's crying out to the Lord Jesus,
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.140]   and what does she say?
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.460]   Even her words are already humble, is it not?
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.460]   Look at verse 22.
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.980]   This Canaanite woman from the region came out and began to cry out saying, "Have mercy
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.340]   on me, Lord, son of David."
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:59.900]   She implores him and desires that he would give her that grace and mercy.
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:05.740]   And that level of desperation, it didn't produce what is natural to the human heart, but rather
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.620]   it produced this beseeching.
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.820]   And I got to say, honestly speaking, if you meditate on that a little bit, being in a
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:19.460]   posture or if you're ever required, like by necessity you're put into a position where
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.060]   you have to ask, it's humbling in and of itself.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:30.180]   I mean, I'll confess, and I'm pretty sure if I take a vote right now, how many of you
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.060]   guys have a hard time asking for help?
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.260]   But the thing about it is, think about our faith.
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:45.180]   We are in a position where by necessity we are taught, "Pray to the Lord for daily bread."
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.540]   Think about that.
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:54.220]   I need to pray to my Father in heaven because I am his child for daily sustenance.
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:14:00.260]   But sometimes, and let me ask you, in your times of difficulty, in your moments of hardship,
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.820]   do you harden up?
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.940]   Do you resort to, "I got to power through this"?
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.500]   I don't need your help kind of mentality.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:11.100]   You might not verbalize it, but do you express that kind of attitude?
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.100]   Or is this challenging to you?
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.300]   "Lord, help me."
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.540]   Just like I need to ask you for my daily bread, for everything that I need in this
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:24.740]   moment, I also need in my greatest needs, in my greatest moments, and here and now in
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.740]   my greatest aspiration, to ask you.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:35.180]   And that's why I think the story is powerful because she comes to the Lord, again, against
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.340]   certain barriers and obstacles.
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.500]   She's making a scene.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.180]   I don't know if there was a massive crowd around her.
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.900]   Clearly there must have been others.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.740]   Clearly the disciples that are watching.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.940]   Clearly by this time that she's asking, they're already annoyed.
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:59.660]   She's making a scene of it, not intentionally, but because she knows, "I am in this position
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.140]   where I need to ask you."
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.180]   And it's in those moments, for me, I'm thinking about it.
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:09.500]   I realize when I give advice now, like, there was this weird time when I think when people,
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:15.380]   you know, excited about, let's say, parenting, excited about wanting to help people in, let's
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:20.020]   say, tangible advice and practical things that we can do to help parenting.
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.700]   I would always give, like, "Well, did you try this?
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.600]   Did you try that?"
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.860]   But now I realize, like, "Hmm, I need to stay off the, like, giving, like, typical
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.860]   advice.
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.860]   Did you try giving him some water?"
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:30.860]   You know?
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.860]   Maybe he's just angry, you know?
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.340]   You try to give him some food.
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.940]   Because my guess is this woman probably has already tried everything.
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:45.260]   If we're jumping down into this story, sympathizing with her, she's in a desperate situation where
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:51.260]   her daughter is cruelly, Scripture says, it's cruelly, like, malintent, bad, horrendously
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.820]   demonized.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.620]   And so she comes to the Lord to ask.
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:03.660]   And so, again, as a quick, quick admonition for you and me, recall that we ask the Lord
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.380]   for mercies.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:11.140]   We ask the Lord in beseeching, with humility, outstretched hands.
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.900]   Psalm chapter 51, verse 1 and 2 is a famous one.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:18.900]   It says, "Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love, according to your
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.900]   great compassion.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:27.900]   Blot out my transgressions, wash away all my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin."
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.420]   She calls out to the Son of David, asking for mercy.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.540]   Now, I'm going to just highlight this for a second here.
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.100]   The reason why I'm essentially commending her faith, so to speak, is because in the
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.580]   way that she's approaching the Lord, I don't think it is just simply a humanistic, "We
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:49.660]   get it, you're desperate, so therefore you're coming, running over here for Him."
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.860]   I think she's exhibiting faith.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:59.500]   Clearly, she is recognizing Him for the stature of who He says He is.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.620]   Whereas the Pharisees would never, ever dare acknowledge, "Oh, you're the Son of David."
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.660]   No, they call Him, "Rabbi, good teacher, maybe miracle worker."
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.940]   But they will never confess that He is the Son of David, because to do so would be to
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.580]   say, "You are the coming one.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.220]   You're the promised one, the Messiah."
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:24.100]   But here and now, she says, "Have mercy on me, Son of David."
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.500]   And so we're going to highlight that as we go.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:32.060]   So what we recognize here is first that she, in her humility, overcomes the desperation,
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.900]   so to speak, not by wallowing, not by fleeing, not by fighting, but by asking.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:42.500]   Point two, this woman's humble faith in the midst of silence is patient.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.500]   Why do I say this?
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.580]   It's because if this woman is coming with such humility and asking the Lord, you would
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:52.180]   think the Lord Jesus would be like, "This is what I was looking for."
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:58.040]   Those Pharisees who just got finished accusing Him for X, Y, and Z, do not think of themselves
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.540]   as sinners.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.940]   They never asked me for help.
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.740]   They asked me for, "Prove this and prove that."
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.700]   But the Lord said, "I have come for sinners."
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.700]   Amen?
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:16.100]   So you would think that the Lord Jesus would say, "Right here, guys.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.980]   This is what I was looking for."
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.060]   But take a look at this unusual response.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:27.540]   Go over to verse 23, and it says, "But He did not answer her a word.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.900]   And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, 'Send her away, because she keeps shouting
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.180]   at us.'"
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.500]   This is really weird.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.180]   Why would Jesus do this?
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.820]   It's completely contrary to what you would expect, especially in a day and culture for
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.100]   us when it's like you never ever turn away anybody.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:53.240]   As a matter of fact, you just make sure that anybody and everybody can come.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.240]   What is this?
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.580]   Well, one thing, we could just kind of hypothesize some stuff.
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:03.260]   Maybe one of the things was that Jesus, it says that He was withdrawing from the people,
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.380]   so He's just withdrawing from her.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:11.860]   A passage I want to highlight to you, Mark chapter 7, verse 24 through 23, it says that
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:16.620]   Jesus got up and went away from there to this region of Tyre, and when He entered into a
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:22.220]   house, He wanted no one to know of it, yet He could not escape the notice.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:27.760]   And that's when this woman hearing of it came and said, "My daughter has an unclean spirit."
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:33.000]   So the whole scenario is Jesus was trying to take His disciples and go and isolate,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.420]   and Jesus repeatedly did this.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:43.320]   All day long, He would preach, He would heal, He would exhaust Himself.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.020]   Many times in Scriptures, Jesus said He was tired, but He would always go to pray.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.220]   So maybe this was one of those moments where it's like, this is actually at a point in
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.380]   time when He had so many people already try to manipulate Him, so many people falsely
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:02.680]   accuse Him, He had so many people try to essentially violently force Him to do things that they
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.420]   wanted, make Him king.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.420]   So maybe He had enough of it.
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:10.900]   He had enough of the like, "You know, you just come to me because of bread.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.060]   You come to me because you're the wicked generation, all you guys want is miracles and signs, and
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.220]   in the end, you want me to feed you and lead you into nirvana."
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.860]   No.
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.780]   I don't know, I can't speak on His behalf because He doesn't say, but clearly Jesus
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.140]   was withdrawing, right?
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.380]   But that also tells me that potentially Jesus was testing Him.
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.100]   Are you like every single other person?
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.380]   But another thing Jesus says, if you look down to the next verse, take a look at this,
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:44.180]   verse 24, "But He answered and said, 'I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.180]   Israel.'"
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:51.860]   Clearly, our Lord, He has His own timetable.
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:58.360]   He has His own progression of how He is going to exhibit His grace in His ministry.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:03.260]   But imagine the woman hearing that, right?
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.300]   This woman is exhibiting patience in that.
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:17.180]   Can you imagine you going to any store, walking up to the counter, people looking up at you,
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.940]   and then looking away?
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.500]   The inner Karen would come out, right?
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:27.740]   The inner rage monster might potentially come out, especially if you saw the one you were
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.660]   trying to get the attention of, the manager, right?
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:36.980]   Talking about you to the other individual, saying, "I didn't come for them," right?
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.460]   Think about that.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:44.100]   I want to ask you, like, we can all relate to this.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:49.620]   Potentially many of you in here, maybe you are going through some really difficult times.
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.860]   Do you feel like the Lord is silent with you?
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.700]   Do you feel like there's – you've been asking, you know, "Okay, I heard the admonition.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.380]   I can't just sit there, and I can't just peruse about my sufferings.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.260]   I need to ask you," so you did.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:09.620]   But then in the end, you don't hear anything.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:14.700]   Do we have the humility then to just continue to persist?
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.380]   Do we have the humility then to have and exhibit patience?
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:24.780]   And every single one of us, we've experienced the strange feeling of disrespect.
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.740]   I asked, "Where is it?"
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.060]   And this is something I want to highlight.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.220]   Every single one of us knows that feeling.
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.540]   Comes in here, you know this feeling.
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.260]   Dinner is ready, not a single reply, right?
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.260]   Like nobody does anything.
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.260]   "Guys, we got to get going," nothing, right?
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:43.860]   Thank goodness you're a godly individual because if you weren't, then you would just
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:47.340]   take that dish and frisbee it over, right?
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:52.220]   Or even in some of the most romantic, like, intimate settings, you feel like you say something
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.260]   and the other person is completely oblivious, right?
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.260]   You're asking a question.
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.500]   You're saying something, and the person, "Oh, yeah."
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.260]   The rage that comes up.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.340]   "How dare you?"
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.620]   Right?
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.260]   I want to challenge every single one of us.
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:14.660]   This woman is exhibiting an incredible perseverance, but I would also say a humility.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:21.820]   To feel like you have someone's back on you is very degrading, but yet she persists, and
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.380]   it continues to go forward.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.380]   Point number three.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:31.260]   Point number three, the woman's humble faith in the midst of harsh realities is yielding,
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.260]   okay?
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.260]   Is yielding.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:38.300]   I hope you guys are seeing that there's a reason why, as I was meditating on this passage,
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:45.020]   part of me wanted to say, "Look at this woman's persevering, powerful faith," right?
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:53.940]   But actually what I see is this woman is being tested, and part of the testing is the natural
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:24:00.300]   human reaction to this could be so prideful.
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:05.020]   But the faith that she exhibits is powerfully humble, and this is what I mean.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:09.900]   I want you to think about this scenario again, and I want you to think about the scenario
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:15.560]   of Jesus saying, "I have only come for the house of Israel," and he's not even talking
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.560]   to her.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.660]   He is answering the disciples, complaining like, "Jesus, did you do something?
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.660]   Tell her to shoo.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.740]   Lady, please stop," right?
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.500]   They're just so frustrated, they want her to just be gone.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:35.220]   And to that, Jesus is teaching or reacting to the disciples saying, "I've only come for
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.220]   the house of Israel."
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.620]   But imagine her hearing that.
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.860]   Imagine us in our day hearing that.
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.380]   "What?
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.300]   Discrimination.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:52.260]   My application is just as good as the Jews," right?
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.700]   "It's not fair.
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.100]   What kind of compassionate leader are you?
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.060]   I thought you were an equal opportunity lender.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.020]   Let me talk to your manager," right?
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.780]   The Karen would go nuts at that statement.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:12.700]   How dare you say that I've only come for the Jews?
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.140]   And if you think that was bad, look at the next passage, because it gets worse.
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:21.900]   Look at what Jesus says.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.900]   Jesus says in verse, let's see here, 26.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.900]   I know I skipped a verse there.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:28.900]   I did that purposely.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:36.100]   Verse 26, "And he answered and said, 'It is not good to take the children's bread and
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.100]   throw it to the dogs.'"
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.300]   Gasp, right?
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:46.940]   And then if you were to picture yourself reacting in the flesh within this scenario, it'd be
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.660]   like, "What did you say?"
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.940]   How dare you?
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.220]   Is that the way you see me right now?
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.220]   Right?
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.700]   Do you remember how I talked about how asking is a humbling thing?
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:06.060]   And I've counseled like, even again, married couples, where they're just like, "I'm not
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.500]   even going to ask anymore.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.500]   I'm not a dog."
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.500]   Like, "Whoa, whoa."
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.500]   Why?
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.860]   Because I'm not going to beg.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:21.740]   To be in that posture where you're forced to ask is really, really humbling.
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.860]   But here and now, Jesus says something different than just that.
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.060]   He didn't say, "You better beg."
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.960]   He didn't say, "You better ask."
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.420]   He said, "This is not even proper."
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.420]   Whoa.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.540]   I want you to think about that.
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:41.220]   There was a book I was reading, Last Name Reichen.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:47.060]   He made sense of it like this, and he said, "To us, we may think that this is cruel, this
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:51.340]   is harsh, but you can think of it another way.
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.340]   This is reality."
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:56.020]   Right?
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:03.220]   And what he said was, "The reality is that God has made," and I love this kind of example
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.220]   and explanation.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:12.020]   "The reality is that God had made a covenant, unique, exclusive relationship with the nation
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.300]   of Israel."
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:19.900]   Which means he has a relationship with the nation as a man would have as with his wife.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:26.260]   Weird that other people will come and expect God to treat them like his own wife.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.760]   God uniquely adopted the nation of Israel.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:34.620]   He describes in the book of Ezekiel that the nation was like a naked and abandoned child
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:39.020]   in its own blood.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:47.640]   And God had mercy, came down, washed the baby, clothed the baby, raised the baby, and now
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.080]   is leading the child by hand.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.560]   That's the beautiful picture that God describes his relationship with Israel.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:28:00.640]   But weird, weird that people come to God and say, "But where's my bed?
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.640]   Where's my clothes?
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.400]   I thought you would have a savings account for my college.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.760]   Where's my wife?
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.800]   Where's my husband?
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.560]   Where's my job?"
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.360]   Weird.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:16.420]   And this is where I say this woman's faith and her humility is shining.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.840]   Because look at her answer.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:26.080]   First, her answer in verse 25 is that she came and began to bow herself down.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.360]   That's proskuneo.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.040]   You guys have heard that term many times.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:34.060]   It means to prostrate oneself all the way low, face to the ground, I'm not worthy of
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.440]   you kind of mentality, to worship.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.720]   It's synonymous to worship.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.820]   She worshiped him even in the midst of this is not your time.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.440]   But also even in the midst of it's not good to take the children's bread and throw it
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.600]   to the dogs.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.600]   Look what she says.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.120]   Verse 27, "Take a look.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.200]   Yes, Lord."
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.640]   Gospel of Mark says, "Truth, Lord.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:06.040]   But even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from the master's table."
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.480]   And I was like, "Wow, lady, you're witty.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   You know, like that's so good.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.040]   You're so sharp and cunning."
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.640]   No.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.820]   She was yielding.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:26.640]   She fought against, I'm assuming because we're human, perhaps that natural inclination.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:33.840]   By faith, Jesus said that our natural state is always going to be this, this struggle.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.980]   He who desires to save his life will lose it.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.920]   That is every single one of our struggle.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:45.520]   And in that way, we have this weird presumptuousness that God highlights many times through scripture
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:50.280]   where we demand, "God, you protect me because I need to survive.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.840]   God, you heal me.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.840]   You do this for me.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.600]   You provide for me.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.760]   You acknowledge me."
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:04.560]   Because that's in our own heart and our ambition.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.280]   But she didn't do that.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:12.720]   She did not have as her priority to combat him.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.400]   "I don't think your laws are fair.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.240]   Let me talk to you about your policies."
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:24.840]   She did not make it her priority to demand that God acknowledge her as also a valuable
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:29.600]   human being and made it about her identity.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.800]   No.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:39.720]   By faith, she beseeched the Lord, crying out and desiring that he minister to her with
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   help.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:46.800]   Brothers and sisters, one of the things I want to highlight to you is, yes, we have,
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:53.120]   whether, you know, I see it in myself, this strange expectation.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:59.160]   All throughout like the biblical history, sinful man has invoked the name of God and
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.840]   just demanded, "You be on my side, okay?"
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:07.040]   And so many times, God would say through the prophets, "Why do you act so presumptuously?
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.160]   When I say judgment, you say peace.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.520]   What in the world is going on?
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.660]   You go into battle, keep constantly invoking my name.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.400]   When I told you, I'm not going with you.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.400]   Why do you do that?"
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.240]   And even Moses said, "We are a presumptuous people."
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.740]   Right?
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.400]   Even here in the New Testament, we're so presumptuous.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.720]   I want to highlight this interesting passage to you.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.980]   If you've heard me preach before, I've hit this passage many times because it is one
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.920]   of my all-time favorites.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.480]   And it comes from the book of Hebrews 2, verse 14 through 18.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.600]   So please take a look there.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.600]   Hebrews 2, 14 through 18.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:50.360]   And the Word of God says this, "Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood,
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:55.440]   he himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death he might render powerless
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.880]   him who had the power of death, that is the devil, and might free those who through fear
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.460]   of death were subject to slavery all their lives."
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.640]   Take a moment to pause there.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:13.360]   He's answering this question, did Christ have to come down, be incarnate, and be flesh and
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   blood like you and me?
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.200]   Did he have to do that?
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.600]   And the answer is a resounding yes.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:25.400]   For God to just be like, "I forgive you all and pardon you," then he's just simply pardoning
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.400]   criminals.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.080]   He would be an unjust judge.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:36.880]   But because we are flesh and blood, he had to come, take our place, pay our penalty,
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.400]   and by his righteous atonement, we are truly, truly free.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.760]   Amen?
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:48.440]   So the answer to the question, did Jesus have to come, is yes, amen.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.240]   But then take a look at verse 16.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:58.080]   Verse 16 says, "But for surely he does not give help to the angels, but he gives help
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.680]   to the descendants of Abraham.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.920]   Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in all things, so that he might become a merciful
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.780]   and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.780]   of the people."
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.780]   What?
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:17.520]   What am I saying here?
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.600]   The demons are looking at this like, "What in the world is going on?
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.000]   Why are you helping creatures lower than us?"
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.600]   To the question of, did Jesus really have to come down, in one sense it was a resounding,
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.040]   "Of course, yes, and without it there is no justice.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.360]   Without it there's no freedom and there's no grace for you."
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.680]   But on this sense, it's like a, "No.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.000]   Is God in any way obligated to help fallen angels?"
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.880]   And the strange answer is, "No."
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.120]   Is God obligated to you?
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.640]   Is God obligated to me?
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.640]   Does he owe us anything?
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.760]   The scripture is really, really clear.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.760]   He owes us nothing.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:13.000]   It's some weird presumption on our end that says, "You have to be like the store where
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.960]   not only do you provide goods and services to the best of your ability being fair and
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:24.480]   equitable, but if I'm disappointed, you better hear me."
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.520]   We're approaching it with little faith then.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.960]   That is small, small faith.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.560]   We should be shocked.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.480]   He's offering help to who?
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:45.200]   As one of my friends here says, "I want you to remember that we are Gentiles and we dare
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.000]   not be uppity about our salvation."
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.480]   He says that, I laugh, but it's so true.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.080]   What do I mean by this?
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.920]   Do you recognize that in Ephesians chapter two, because of the length of time, I can't
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:06.240]   read the whole chapter, but it begins with, "You are not only dogs, but you're dead corpse.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.280]   You're dead in your transgressions.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.520]   You're children of wrath.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.840]   You have your own father."
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.000]   You're walking in disobedience.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.520]   And then later on, it describes, "You have no promise like the Israelites do.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.920]   You're outside of the commonwealth of Israel.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.920]   You have no hope.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:30.320]   You have no inheritance because you have no God."
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.840]   That's the state of affairs.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.840]   That's the reality.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:39.480]   And by faith, this woman is getting the glimpse of that and beyond and above what the other
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.840]   Pharisees were thinking.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.320]   She got it.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:47.080]   "Right, Lord, and that's why I am willing to take whatever you give me.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.760]   Have mercy on me.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.400]   Help me," she asked.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.880]   I think to me, that's powerful.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.120]   Can I confess something?
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.200]   Sometimes when I have a hard time, I'm all stressed out, and then I say these words,
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:06.240]   "I've been praying about," I think I need to rephrase that.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.520]   I've been mulling, daydreaming, and complaining about.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.280]   I'm a man of like, I have deep thoughts that I don't like to share with people, and I overthink
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.280]   everything.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:20.840]   So what I typically do is if I have a problem, I trace every scenario down to its nth degree
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.680]   and think about all the pros and cons down the line.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.160]   That's why it takes me a long time to decide something.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.640]   I'm just ruminating.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:32.560]   If this, then B. If this, then C. I'm just sitting there, right?
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.280]   And then at the end of that, I tell people, "I prayed about it."
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:43.720]   Brothers and sisters, your ruminating about your hardships is not the same as humble requests,
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.040]   right?
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:51.840]   But this woman, even in the midst of that, I guess you could say, rude and harsh reality,
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:57.160]   she comes, says, "Yes, Lord, but would you help me?"
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.320]   That's powerful.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:04.440]   She overcame that innate, which every single one of us, because I pray that I would have
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.160]   my pride overcome like that.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.960]   I place myself in her scenarios, and I say silly things like, "How dare you?"
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.960]   Because that's natural.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.280]   But by faith, she's overcoming the flesh.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:23.560]   And that's why I say, I think she's doing much more than just desperately coming to
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.600]   find medicine for her daughter, right?
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.720]   She's giving God worship.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:35.480]   And that's why when Jesus is looking at this, He commends her and says, "You have great
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.400]   faith."
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:44.920]   Because starting from men of old, the great Christians, the great faithful behaved like
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.000]   her.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.700]   I want to highlight for you a passage in Isaiah chapter 6, verse 5.
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:54.680]   You know that when Isaiah came before the Lord, he came actually with a complaint.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.040]   Because at that time, kings were being assassinated.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.640]   Potentially there's no king on the throne.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.400]   What in the world are we going to do, Lord?
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:07.520]   And what he sees is the amazing picture of God on the throne.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.520]   And that's when he says, "Yes!"
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.040]   No, no, that's not what he says.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.640]   That's when he says, "I am ruined."
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.040]   Because when you have faith and you see God, you see yourself in reference to God.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.040]   And next thing you know, he says, "I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.200]   of unclean lips.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.320]   I am undone."
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:32.960]   Peter, when he saw the power of Jesus in Luke chapter 5, verse 8, Peter sees Jesus.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.880]   He sees power that he has command over everything.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   And what does he say?
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.120]   He gets down low and he falls at his feet and says, "Go away from me, Lord, for I am
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.360]   a sinful man."
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.320]   You guys know the story.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:53.240]   The person of faith sees the reality and says, "Not like the Pharisee."
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.840]   Thank goodness I'm not like all of you.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.760]   No, like the tax collector.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.960]   "Lord, have mercy on me, for I am a sinner."
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.000]   That's great faith.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.120]   And the woman exhibited it.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.840]   And so I asked, like, you think about this whole scenario, and it's pretty profound.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:16.160]   Jesus is withdrawing to teach his disciples, preparing, he's constantly preparing them
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.520]   for the cross that he's going to endure.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.420]   But what an incredible object lesson.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.480]   He just got teaching the disciples.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.680]   The Pharisees asked, "You folks are unclean.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.320]   Why in the world do you not keep the traditions?"
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.320]   And then you basically are defiling yourself.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.120]   Unclean people, they accuse them like that.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.560]   And Jesus says to them, "It's not what goes into your mouth that's making you unclean.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:42.360]   It's the stuff that's coming out of your mouth that makes you unclean."
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.480]   And the disciples are like, "Can you explain that for us?
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.880]   We don't really get it."
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:46.880]   It's really funny.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:47.880]   Disciples are great.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.880]   They feel like them.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.880]   It's like, "Huh?
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:50.880]   What's going on?"
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.960]   What an object lesson.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.480]   And that's why I think our Lord, he's a merciful Lord.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:05.120]   I believe he was drawing the faith out of them.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.120]   Disciples are annoying.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.120]   "What are we doing with this girl?
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.120]   Let's kick her out."
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.120]   Right?
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.760]   Like, I don't know what they were thinking.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.080]   But then Jesus says, "Great faith."
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.120]   In the Greek, it's mega faith.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:21.080]   It's not mega like the way we use mega, but it does mean massive.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.240]   It's mega.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.240]   It's massive.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:33.280]   For her to say, for her to be able to say, not only, I'm assuming, if Jesus like made
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.600]   the analogy even worse than a dog, right?
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.680]   If he said something like, "Not only do you not give the food to the dogs, but you don't
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.320]   bring in the stray," she'd be like, "Yes, Lord."
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.760]   I am the stray.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.160]   I was out of the camp.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.720]   I know I have no place here.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.560]   It's not like she doesn't know, 'cause she's a Canaanite woman, have nothing to do with
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.400]   this Jewish Messiah.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.840]   She absolutely knows.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.400]   It was not her ambition to make it fair.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:04.680]   It was not her ambition to be Jesus' highest priority at the moment.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.840]   She was seeking mercy.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:13.000]   In that way, guys, brothers and sisters, would be our humble faith.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.800]   I want to ask you, how are you?
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.680]   First, I ask, how are you struggling with your sufferings, your hardships?
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.600]   But I want to ask, how are you genuinely coming to God?
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.320]   Are you coming with sentiments of complaint?
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.320]   "God, no one's reaching out to me here.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.160]   God, you don't say enough in your Bible about this."
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:34.120]   You think of faith as like some kind of switch, where like if it switched, then everything
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.800]   would be grand, right?
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.140]   By faith, yeah, I would know what I would do about my business.
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.360]   By faith, I would know if I should do this or not.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.360]   By faith, should I marry her?
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:46.120]   And then you just switch it on, it's like, "Ooh, I get it," right?
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.040]   Use your wisdom.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.840]   Use God's given discernment that He's given you.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:42:02.880]   But by faith, we recognize, "Lord, everything I have, it's nothing of my own.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.700]   Everything I have is from your gracious, merciful hand.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:12.040]   And so every suffering I'm experiencing now, I request of you grace and mercy.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:16.200]   And you know what an incredible privilege we have."
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.160]   Are we in a situation where we're just going to extend our hands and who knows when He'll
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.640]   answer, and then, I don't know, right?
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.640]   No.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:30.960]   We have the privilege of knowing that our God, His heart is so kind, He lavishes us.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:35.960]   And we know that as a good father, He is going to answer us according to His good fatherly
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.600]   wisdom.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:42.400]   And so that's why for us, this humility is going to produce every fruit of thankfulness,
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:46.440]   praise, confidence, joy.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:50.120]   This humility then is tied to every other spiritual fruit we're going to produce in
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.120]   our lives.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.120]   Does that make sense?
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:57.080]   And so I pray that we would recognize my way of conclusion.
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:03.000]   Again, I don't want to just simply, you know, see this as like my attempt to stick her into
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.040]   the hall of faith, you know?
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:10.960]   I don't want to just simply like commend her, but what a challenge to have that kind of
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:11.960]   humility.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:18.320]   But let's turn it now to our God, our loving Heavenly Father.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:24.280]   When He's thinking about your strong faith, He's not thinking, "Go, right?
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.960]   Convert Africa for me."
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:34.200]   And Pastor Peter has been preaching this heavily like, "It's not contingent on you, right?
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.720]   It's God."
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.520]   She didn't bring anything to the table because what God desired of us, He said, "What do
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.880]   I require of you, man?
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:49.080]   To love mercy and to walk humbly with me."
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.080]   And this is where we get to say, "Yes, Lord.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.080]   I trust you.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.520]   I've got nothing to bring to the table.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.000]   So I request of you mercies.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.720]   Thank you for lavishing upon me every grace and every love."
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.440]   Let's pray.
