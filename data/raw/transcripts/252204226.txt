[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Well, if you would please turn your Bibles over to the book of Leviticus, chapter 19.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:40.920]   Okay, I'm going to read you kind of an interesting section of the Scripture, starting from verse
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.800]   9 down to verse 16.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.680]   It's a list of various laws that God has given.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.280]   And then we'll take a moment to pray and jump in.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.080]   In Leviticus chapter 19, verse 9, it says, "Now when you reap the harvest of your land,
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.420]   you shall not reap to the very corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.200]   of your harvest, nor shall you glean your vineyard, nor shall you gather the fallen
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.420]   fruit of your vineyard.
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.320]   You shall leave them for the needy and for the stranger.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.620]   I am the Lord your God.
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.120]   You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.500]   You shall not swear falsely by my name so as to profane the name of your God.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.120]   I am the Lord.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.900]   You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him.
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.000]   The wages of a hired man are not to remain with you all night until morning.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.460]   You shall not curse a deaf man, nor place a stumbling block before the blind.
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.660]   But you shall revere your God.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.380]   I am the Lord.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.520]   You shall do no injustice in judgment.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.680]   You shall not be partial to the poor, nor defer to the great.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.660]   But you are to judge your neighbor fairly.
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.540]   You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people, and you are not to act against
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.320]   the life of your neighbor.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.900]   I am the Lord.
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.440]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.800]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your grace, and we're asking for continued grace as we
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.020]   study your word.
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.100]   Give us grace by illuminating your word to us.
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.500]   Help us, Father God, again, if there is any fog of tiredness and fatigue, if there's any
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.420]   distraction, Lord, would your spirit minister to us that not only would we be receptive,
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.120]   but by your word we would be transformed.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.940]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.940]   Amen.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.940]   Okay.
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.100]   So today we're talking not specifically about one passage.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.460]   Last week was an overview, and today it's going to be like an overview part two, where
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.460]   the overview of the book in terms of its background, structure, main thematics happened.
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.900]   Today we're talking about practical holiness, almost like an overview of our life when we
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.300]   look at this book.
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.180]   So the study is called Leviticus and Practical Holiness.
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.820]   Now just by way of intro, when I think of holiness, when I was younger, I thought of
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.340]   holiness just like I thought about glory.
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.860]   When I thought about glory, it's like, "Wah!"
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.340]   Something glorious then would be just majestic, super bright, shiny, and all that stuff.
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.980]   Clouds, glorious light, white, like blazing white glory, et cetera, that kind of stuff.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.980]   And I thought holiness was kind of like that, just, "Wah!"
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.940]   But when I think of practical holiness or practical sanctification, yeah, when I was
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.060]   younger I did think very simplistically.
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.220]   So if I want to think about practical holiness, I got to think about what I should and should
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.620]   not do.
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.580]   And I just read you a passage that told you what you should and should not do.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.800]   Very much the book of Leviticus is so full of direct commandments of what is prohibited
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.280]   and what is permitted.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.860]   So as we take a look at that, there's a sense to which in the end maybe we can boil down
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.740]   practical holiness as this definition.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.160]   It's just a guiding principle about making a decision about what to do.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.220]   So I think I might have the firstâ€”oops, I forgot to turn this on.
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.260]   Maybe we're thinking practical holiness in light of just principles, golden rules to
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:20.020]   live by, and essentially you're just making a decision what is okay and what is not.
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.660]   Interestingly enough, that would be a lot like modern practices.
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.500]   What do I mean by that?
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.820]   The world and its wisdom has principles for you to live by.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.300]   Is the scripture, when it wants us to be holy or to live a certain way, is it simply doing
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.860]   the same thing?
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.660]   Well, according to worldly wisdom, long ago Aristotle centuries ago said as an ethic,
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.340]   like a moral, "In all things, moderation."
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.300]   Too much of one thing or anything is too much.
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.620]   It's bad.
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.420]   So there are people who live by that.
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.180]   They want a moderate life.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.820]   They don't want to be super this, super that.
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.500]   They want kind of medium living, right?
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.020]   There is this utilitarianism kind of greatest good for the greatest amount of people.
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.620]   Whatever maximizes produce, whatever maximizes end benefits, that's what you should decide
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.620]   to do.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.780]   And then lastly, postmodernism says like, "Just make sure you're not stepping on anybody's
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.780]   toes.
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.780]   Do no harm."
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.220]   Have you guys ever heard that?
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.040]   Do no harm, you know?
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.380]   And there is that mentality.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.900]   As long as it doesn't hurt anybody, you know?
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.460]   As long as it doesn't hurt anybody.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.860]   So the reason why I list for you those different principles to live by is because obviously
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:41.200]   our God operates far and above, beyond simple principles.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.060]   Is our God principled?
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.260]   Yes.
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.780]   Are there standards?
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.820]   Yes.
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:54.140]   But the expectation practically is not simply this guideline, this one principle.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:00.100]   Rather, there is a fundamental approach that God gives us as Christians, which is summarized
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.380]   in that statement, "Be holy, for I am holy."
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.200]   So today we're going to try to talk about this.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.780]   It is a big concept, practical holiness.
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.860]   That's a huge concept.
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.200]   It's like saying today we're going to talk about what godliness means.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.720]   What does it mean to have glorious living, right?
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.860]   What does it mean to have gospel living?
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.140]   It's a huge, huge concept.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:29.060]   But hopefully we can put some trajectory of what are we pursuing in practicality.
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.700]   So in order for us to wrap our minds around that, the very first point I'm going to make
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.700]   is this.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:45.860]   This concept of "Be holy, for I am holy," it can be seen as a call to relational fidelity.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.660]   This call for us, practically speaking, where God has said, "Be holy, for I am holy," can
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:59.460]   be seen as relational fidelity, meaning it is a call for you to have faithfulness and
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.620]   loyalty, a sense of direct allegiance to God.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:10.100]   And the practicality comes when you operate underneath those parameters in the context
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.300]   of that relationship.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:19.660]   Turn the page over to Leviticus chapter 20, and let's look at a Bible verse on that.
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.580]   Over in Leviticus chapter 20, verses 24 through 27.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.700]   Leviticus chapter 20, verses 24 through 27.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.300]   And the Word of God says, "Hence I have said to you, you are to possess their land, and
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.700]   I myself will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.540]   I am the Lord your God, who has separated you from the peoples.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:52.840]   You are therefore to make a distinction between the unclean bird and the clean.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.660]   You shall not make yourself detestable by animal or any bird or anything that creeps
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.220]   on the ground, which I have separated for you as unclean."
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.860]   Now look at this.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:11.460]   "Thus, you are to be holy to me, for I am the Lord, so I the Lord am holy.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.260]   I have set you apart from the peoples to be mine.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.180]   Now a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist shall surely be put to death.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.580]   They shall be stoned with stones, their blood glittiness is upon them."
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.700]   So that passage right there, Leviticus chapter 20, verses 20 through 27, there is an emphatic
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:37.580]   case where he says, "Look it, I've given you many, many principles which are only examples
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:44.140]   of the point, and the point is I want you to be separate for me."
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.380]   And so there is this relational term.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:52.180]   I write here for you that if we define holiness, you guys have heard that definition, to be
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.140]   separate, set apart, right?
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:59.500]   If you define holiness as separation or a consecration, then we simply add the relational
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.260]   term to him.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:07.020]   You're being consecrated and set apart for him, right?
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:13.420]   So the whole context of the call to be holy is relational.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:21.460]   And if I can highlight, even within this passage, there is this relational idea of both, I want
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:27.700]   to separate you away from the others and separate you for me.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:35.060]   By way of example, let's think about a couple, a woman and a man, you know, wife and husband.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:39.340]   Imagine that, let's say, this girl and this guy, when they were dating, the guy kind of
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:44.940]   had some issues because the girl happened to have a ton of male friends.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:50.460]   Maybe she was one of those girls who was just so, like, trusting in people that maybe she
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.740]   had a previous dating relationship with a guy, and then she kept him as a friend, not
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:01.220]   knowing that previous boyfriend is still hoping for an open door, right?
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.380]   During the dating period, the guy feels like, "Oh, man, should I say something?
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.180]   I'm just a boyfriend.
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:12.180]   There's no way I can tell her, like, 'Drop your friends,' you know, or 'I'm leaving.'"
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.260]   He can't say that, so all of a sudden he feels like, "Hmm, maybe I should just hold my tongue.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.100]   She'll kind of figure it out on her own."
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:23.300]   But lo and behold, they get more serious, they get engaged, and she still retains all
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.180]   these male friends.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.740]   Lo and behold, he's thinking, "Well, surely, once we actually have the ceremony and get
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:37.900]   married, she's going to prioritize me above every other male in her life, right?"
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.420]   Now imagine if she was like, "No, but he's so fun to go to Disneyland with, but when
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.180]   I need counseling, he's always there."
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:52.300]   You see, within this passage, he says, "You are going to be set apart from me, so how
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.540]   dare you go talk to mediums and spirits, right?"
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.620]   That's basically what he's saying.
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.940]   You go to these spirits to go find your resource of spiritual help and stability?
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.180]   How dare you, right?
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:11.300]   Now truthfully, yeah, within, let's say, the dating process, truthfully, yes, the guy doesn't
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.820]   have the right to be like, "I'm your man and you're mine, so drop all your friends.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.700]   I don't want you talking to that chump," because then what?
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.980]   He's just a jealous fool.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:27.940]   But when you're in the context of a marriage relationship, there has to be a pulling away
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:33.020]   from the others and then a moving towards the one, yes?
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.300]   And so that's what I'm talking about.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.820]   When we think about practical holiness, yes, we can sit here and say, "Okay, can we please
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.660]   talk about sexual purity today?
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.620]   Can I talk about your money use?
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.220]   Can I talk about how holiness of your thought?"
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.780]   And we can go down the list of what to do and what not to do, but that would only scratch
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:56.060]   the surface of the big parameter of how God wants you to operate in life, which is under
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:00.220]   the concept of relational fidelity to God.
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.500]   Amen?
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:06.620]   And that should then dictate for us what is permissible, what is not permissible, and
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.100]   maybe even not those terms.
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.640]   What is good and bad for the marriage, this relationship?
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.640]   What is healthy?
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:21.640]   I mean, I want you to think about that question in any given relationship.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:28.420]   What sort of things expressively, like even non-verbally communicate, "Hey, I'm committed
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.420]   to you."
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.880]   You know, I do a lot of premarital counseling and also just like counseling for married
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.960]   couples and whatever, and in the premarital counseling, there is one question I always
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.960]   ask.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.960]   I ask about communication.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.640]   "When do you feel most loved?
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.340]   When do you feel most secure?
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.400]   And does he know it or does she know it?"
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   Right?
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.120]   Because then now we're talking about understanding each other, and those are some sweet opportunities
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:58.200]   to give the people a chance to just lift each other up and say good things and all that
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   kind of stuff.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.200]   So typically they do.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.680]   It's like, "I love it when Johnny this does that or Chris this and Tom this," and they
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.720]   just say, "When they care, when they do this."
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.080]   Well, I want you guys to take a moment to think about that, just for a moment right
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.880]   now, start listing it off in your head.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:21.840]   Between a man and a woman who are in that kind of covenant love, what are the actions
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:28.120]   that expressively communicate, "I'm committed to you"?
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:34.160]   What are the actions that expressively communicate visibly that you are committed?
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:40.960]   Well, some of the answers that I get in premarital counseling, they'll say, "Oh, you know, there
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.440]   was this one time when he was really, really far and I had this thing and he was super
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.200]   tired but he sacrificed his time to come help me, and then I knew."
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   You know?
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   "And then he knew, is it?"
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.680]   No, there's the new, like, "I knew that he had my best interest."
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.680]   Yes?
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.560]   There was another one where a guy shared, like, "Man, you know, sometimes for me, I'm
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.640]   just a workhorse.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.920]   All I want to do is just do stuff.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.920]   I can't say a lot.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.600]   I'm not good with my words, and definitely I can't put my emotions into words and stuff,
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.640]   but I just want to do stuff for her."
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:17.160]   But when she notices and has a growing appreciation, man, like, it makes me feel like we're going
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.000]   to stay together, you know?
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.520]   Other ones are overcoming hurdles.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.440]   You have a disagreement, but then the guy says, "You know what?
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.440]   I know we're fighting.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.360]   I'm all frustrated, but we're going to make it through this."
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.360]   You know?
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.360]   It's like, "Oh, my gosh, you're so committed."
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.360]   You know?
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.040]   Like, there's commitments and all that.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:38.800]   But in the end, there's just a simple, simple, simple answer to that is when you expressly
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:46.560]   show that your longing is for more of that person, "I just want more time with you,"
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.880]   the person's going to feel secure.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.280]   Because when does an individual feel not secure?
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.520]   When all of a sudden, some, like, thought creeps into their mind, they conclude, "That
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.600]   person doesn't want me anymore."
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600]   Right?
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:06.360]   So now, I give you these things as examples because we're talking about practical holiness,
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.360]   right?
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.720]   Practical holiness.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.560]   And the fact of the matter is, just like whatever happens in the relationship context, it is
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:19.760]   true for you, there are things that are unholy because you're not prioritizing the relational
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.020]   fidelity, right?
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:26.360]   Because what does it mean to be unholy, to be mixed?
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.360]   What does it mean to be unholy in the eyes of God, to have, like, you know, a mixed allegiance
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.360]   to here and there?
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.320]   You're not committed here or there, right?
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:42.680]   So likewise, when you think of practical holiness, don't think of, like, "Well, this isn't explicitly
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.680]   said so I can do it."
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.840]   No, no, no.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:51.880]   If you've been living life so busy, and I'm just going to use this as an example, not
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.200]   to make you all feel guilty because we're all busy, right?
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.840]   But I was very convicted about this as I was thinking.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:03.560]   Holiness, desire, relational context.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:09.040]   If you're living life so busy that you've been neglecting God, and then the first opportunity
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.760]   where you get a break, your heart goes to, "Dang, I haven't worked out in a while.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.560]   I've got to go to the gym," right?
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.040]   Ask yourself if that works in marriage.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.160]   You work 60, 70 hours a week because I know some of you guys do.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.760]   You haven't talked to your wife in a while because she goes to bed before you come home.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.840]   And the first opportunity you get, you bounce to go to the gym.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.760]   Is she going to be okay?
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.080]   Does that show relational fidelity and commitment?
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.320]   I'm committed to you.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.280]   What does that show?
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:46.080]   Now, to me then, that broadens the concept of holiness not to simply, many of us might
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.840]   be thinking, "Holiness, okay, sexual purity."
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.980]   It broadens the concept.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.360]   Your use of time when it's all for you or when the first opportunity you get, or maybe
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.480]   something really bad goes on at work and you're just distraught, and then your first reaction
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.480]   is like, "Forget it."
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.800]   You come home and you say, "Forget it.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.440]   I don't want to do any of this."
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.960]   Does that communicate fidelity?
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:15.360]   You see, so I want us to think of holiness in that context so that, A, we don't limit
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:20.120]   holiness to certain arenas of our life where it's clear struggles.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.820]   But what's more, we're having a direction.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:31.620]   Holiness has more to do with your fidelity towards God and how you dedicate yourself.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.100]   Amen?
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.060]   That's what the scripture says.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.020]   Another passage I want us to go to is Leviticus chapter 22.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.340]   Leviticus chapter 22, verse 2 and 3.
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.340]   Okay?
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.180]   Or starting from verse 1.
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:52.260]   When the Lord spoke to Moses saying, "Tell Aaron and his sons to be careful with the
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:18:00.340]   holy gifts of the sons of Israel, which they dedicate to me, so as not to profane my holy
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.340]   name.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.380]   I am the Lord.
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:08.100]   Say to them, 'If any man among all your descendants throughout your generation approaches the
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:13.940]   holy gifts which the son of Israel dedicates to the Lord, while he has an uncleanness,
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.060]   that person shall be cut off from before me.
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.260]   I am the Lord.'"
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.260]   Okay?
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:25.420]   So in this passage, I want us to notice something as we transition to the next point.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.180]   The first thing is very clear.
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:33.660]   Holiness has a lot to do with the relationship, your dedication to God.
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.660]   And we notice even in the list of the laundry list of commandments, it's, "Do this.
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.860]   I am your Lord."
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:47.100]   And the whole idea here is, "Dedicate yourself to me before me."
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:53.320]   Now moving to the next point though from this passage, what you see is there is a qualification
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.980]   to how you can come.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.740]   Right?
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.780]   Pastor Peter made this a big, big thematic point.
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.700]   The scripture of Leviticus is a how-to.
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.380]   How do you approach God in worship?
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.660]   How to come to him, right?
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:16.660]   And what's clear from this passage is that there's an absolute standard, a heavy standard.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:24.500]   And so, let's look at the next point here.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:30.100]   The point is, the "Be holy for I am holy," the calling that God gives us, can be seen
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.100]   as an objective standard of God.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.100]   Sorry I left it blank.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.460]   I was supposed to fill that in.
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.860]   Objective standard of God.
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.180]   Objective standard of God.
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:51.220]   So what I'm saying now is, there is a previous point that has to do with relational context,
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:57.500]   and so it doesn't have detailed, explicit points, but a rather trajectory.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.980]   What I'm saying obviously is there's both.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:07.100]   There is the objective standard of God's holiness, which is timeless, which is broad and universal.
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.100]   Right?
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.180]   So maybe for us, again, when we think of the concept of holiness, we're thinking about
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:17.660]   things where we're supposed to stay away from things that are vile, wicked, detestable,
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.100]   and namely, we're thinking about maybe perversions and sexual sin.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:31.300]   However, God, in his holy standard, actually projects a universal standard that comes from
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.180]   his character.
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:41.060]   So the standard cannot be limited to a set of propositions or statements, but rather,
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.900]   it is an objective standard of God.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.740]   God himself is that objective standard.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.420]   It's a standalone standard.
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:55.900]   And so all I'm saying is, when we're thinking about this second point, holiness can be focused
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:04.060]   on God's statement, "Be holy for I am holy," but you can focus in on, "And I am."
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.180]   The specific words, "I am."
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.980]   That's what we're focusing on right now.
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.100]   And why do I talk about this?
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:20.060]   Because when we think about personal holiness, I wonder if there are seasons of your life
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:29.620]   where we think and maybe assume that because we're not doing something really, really detestable,
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:34.660]   that maybe we are already holy to the degree that we ought to be.
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:40.900]   It's the kind of mentality where because we've avoided the extremes of sin, maybe we feel
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.240]   that we've already come to a point that we've done enough.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.740]   But the Scripture is absolutely clear.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:52.500]   The standard of holiness is as high as God's character.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.980]   As the Scripture talks about how God's ways, how his thoughts are higher than ours, so
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.060]   is the standard of holiness.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.980]   But what's more, it's broader.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:05.020]   It's broader than what we normally think about when we think about holiness.
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:10.540]   If we only kind of limited it to like spiritual holiness, where we're not meddling with mediums
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:16.740]   and idols and stuff like that, or again, whether when we think holiness, we think flesh, lust,
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.700]   that kind of stuff.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:25.180]   Did you know, just by way of talking more about this idea that there are broader traits,
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.860]   there are more than meets the eye when it comes to thinking about holiness, that there
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.060]   is a lot of topics that the Scriptures talk about in the book of Leviticus.
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:39.180]   For example, definitely the Scriptures in Leviticus talk about sexual purity.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.300]   So I have some blanks for you there.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.580]   But what's more, Scripture talks even about love.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:56.820]   Go back in your Bible to chapter 19, and did you guys notice that in chapter 19 verses
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:04.540]   9 and 10, he talks about how now when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:09.340]   reap to the very corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleaning of your harvest,
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.220]   nor shall you glean your vineyard, nor shall you gather the fallen fruit of the vineyard.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.260]   You shall leave them for the needy and the stranger.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.580]   I am the Lord your God.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.740]   Did you catch that stuff?
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.640]   The Word of God is loving.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.260]   It challenged us to have this kind of care where you're not just greedy hearted like,
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.260]   "Ooh, every ounce."
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.940]   You know, you got to squeeze everything from your field, but rather he says, "Leave it.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:34.940]   Stuff that's already fallen."
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.420]   It's like, "Ooh, I can't touch that anymore."
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.420]   Why?
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.180]   Because you got to leave it for the next person.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:45.300]   Scripture in its content is absolutely loving, and it goes so later on in the story.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:50.900]   Do you remember how King Solomon was known for his wisdom and many people, kings of other
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.180]   nations and the queen of Sheba came?
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.700]   Do you know what they said?
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:24:02.300]   "Wow, you have great wisdom, and who else has laws like this, so loving and kind?"
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.460]   The Word of God is glorious like that.
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:09.020]   The Scriptures and the commandments in the book of Leviticus are glorious like that.
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.300]   There are commandments of forgiveness.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:15.340]   The commandments where it says, "Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one another,
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.500]   but love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.980]   That famous, famous line, "Love your neighbor as yourself," is quoted first in the Leviticus.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:29.180]   There's topics of, so there's forgiveness, there's mercy, okay?
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.940]   There's mercy.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.940]   What's more?
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.820]   There's topics of business practices where it talks about how, you noticed earlier, it's
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.260]   like, don't hold a worker until the end of the day.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.060]   Don't hold their wages.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.820]   Don't force them to do X, Y, and Z that they didn't agree to.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.820]   Proper treatment of the poor.
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.080]   It even talks about judging your neighbors appropriately.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.540]   Don't have biased eyes.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:55.340]   Don't be all partial and do favoritism because they just happen to be a little bit more wealthy,
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.940]   or you assume they're going to give you some kind of kickback.
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:06.580]   The reason I want to talk about all this is because we realize, man, God and his expectation
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:12.980]   for our holiness is truly beyond just principled living.
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:19.940]   I tell my youth group students all the time, they get fed this idea that the world wants
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:26.340]   them to be good people, people who avoid gangs, drugs, and violence, people who avoid parties
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:32.100]   and drinking, and they just want to have great careers, come to church, and be good citizens.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:37.140]   And I tell my youth group students all the time, God wants more from you than that.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.380]   That's not even bare minimum in God's eyes.
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:45.340]   And so I say, God desires imitation.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.620]   And so this is going to be the application.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:53.540]   Whereas before we said the application of our holiness being in the context of the relationship,
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:58.580]   that means you want to live in expressed faithfulness, you want to long for him, you want to do things
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:03.500]   that show him, man, you're at the forefront of my priority.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:07.940]   But then the application practically, for practical holy living, when you see that God's
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:14.540]   command is beyond principles, what you're trying to shoot for is imitation.
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.300]   Imitation of God's character.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:21.060]   There's a passage for us over in 1 John 2, verse 6.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:25.020]   Okay, 1 John 2, verse 6.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:33.620]   It says this, "The one who says he abides in him ought himself to walk in the same manner."
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:40.420]   If you say you have Christ in you, and his Holy Spirit is working in your mind and heart,
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.620]   then you need to walk like him.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.220]   You see, for me, I think this is good.
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.580]   This is really, really good.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:55.020]   Because I'm going to be honest with you, when the scriptures talk about this idea of being
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:27:00.900]   expressive, your passion, and the whole commandment earlier about relationship, I mean, I'm going
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.980]   to confess, even in my own marriage, that's a big learning process.
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.980]   For a lot of guys, whoever, if the relationship aspect is new and you're learning, you don't
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:14.040]   know sometimes what to do to make the person feel a certain way.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.060]   But then this, copy him.
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.660]   To me, that's as practical as you can get.
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:28.620]   You see how God speaks in the Bible, and what that reveals to you is his will and his heart.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.820]   Copy him.
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.060]   Copy how he speaks.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.220]   Copy his intentions.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.500]   Copy his thoughts.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.820]   You see how God operates and works.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.720]   That shows his character, his delivery.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.220]   Copy him.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.060]   Copy him as much as you can.
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.500]   And that's absolutely what the scripture says.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.980]   We're going to read a lengthy portion of scripture.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.940]   Turn all the way over to Ephesians chapter 5.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:56.300]   Ephesians chapter 5.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:02.660]   We're going to read verses 1 through 18.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.660]   One through 18.
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:15.260]   What God says is, "Therefore, be imitators of God as beloved children."
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.260]   Boom.
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.780]   New Testament command as explicit as can be.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:25.300]   God through apostle Paul went through chapters 1 and 3 talking about all of what God has
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.300]   done.
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.220]   God has in his good intention chosen you.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.820]   God has sent his son in his great mercy.
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:31.820]   He has made you one.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.980]   He's broken dividing walls.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.620]   And he's shown you his immense love.
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.140]   And he says, "Live a manner now worthy of the gospel."
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.180]   And then, boom, be imitators of God.
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.180]   Verse 2.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:47.260]   "Walk in love just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up for us, an offering and
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.840]   a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:57.180]   But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you as is proper among
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.300]   saints.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:03.220]   And there must be no filthiness and silly talk or coarse jesting which are not fitting
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.240]   but rather giving of thanks.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:10.500]   For this you know with certainty that no immoral or impure person or covetous man who is an
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:15.100]   idolater has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.500]   Let no one deceive you with empty words.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.820]   For because of these things, the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.900]   Therefore, do not be partakers with them.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:28.620]   For you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.100]   Walk as children of light.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:34.220]   For the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:38.140]   Join to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.700]   Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them.
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:47.140]   For it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.620]   But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.740]   For everything that becomes visible is light.
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:59.660]   For this reason it says, 'Awake, sleeper, and rise from the dead, and Christ will shine
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.660]   in you.'
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:05.980]   Therefore, be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise, making the most of
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.780]   your time, because the days are evil.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.660]   So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:16.100]   And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.340]   Be filled with the Spirit."
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.300]   So here he says, "Imitate him."
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:27.180]   And one of the applications that's drawn from the book of Ephesians here in chapter 5 is
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.180]   repeated.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.180]   The application is this.
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.940]   Let me give you an example of this.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:36.820]   In verse 10, he says, "Understand what is pleasing to the Lord."
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:40.780]   In verse 14, he says, "Being careful how you walk, being wise."
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.200]   So you're understanding what you're doing.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.620]   And then in verse 17, he says, "Don't be a fool.
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.260]   Understand what the will of the Lord is."
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:54.120]   And then later you can even say, adding to the theme, he says, "Don't be drunk.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.540]   Be sober in the Spirit."
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.820]   And so here is the challenge and exhortation to you.
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:08.780]   Being imitators of God must absolutely mean that you can discern, I repeat, you can discern
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.860]   and judge as God does.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.980]   You can tell what is good and bad.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.260]   You know what's clean and unclean.
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:21.000]   You have a growing capacity to say, "This is not pleasing to the Lord."
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.300]   It may not be written, "Thus says the Lord."
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.220]   It may not be written in our church bylaws.
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:29.540]   It may not be written on our church membership covenant, but this does not please my God.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.540]   How do I know?
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.300]   I've been walking with Him.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.300]   I love Him.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.820]   I've been imitating Him.
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.620]   I've been walking in holiness.
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:46.900]   Now that may sound arrogant to the world, but God has called us to be discerning.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.820]   You notice in the other passages in the book of Leviticus, you're going to see so many
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.900]   times so that you may know what is clean and unclean.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.380]   I am the Lord.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.880]   You may know what is clean and unclean.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.740]   You should know what is discerning.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:05.540]   You should know what is displeasing to God, what is shameful in His eyes versus the stuff
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.940]   that He wants to see.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:14.580]   So again, I repeat that phrase where we don't want to see holiness as since I'm not doing
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:19.180]   this laundry list of don'ts, I'm okay.
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.220]   No.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.500]   God desires more from us from that.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:32.060]   Remember last week, Pastor Peter said that the book of Leviticus, its ultimate purpose
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.300]   is to reveal the extent of His holiness.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.660]   I'll repeat that.
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:44.740]   The book of Leviticus, its ultimate purpose is to reveal the extent of God's holiness.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:52.480]   Then our maturity, our growing understanding in that, then you should understand to a broad
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:33:01.260]   breath and depth how deep His holiness is, what is pleasing to Him, what would be something
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.460]   that's offensive.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.700]   That's something we want to grow in.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:08.400]   I want to now pose that to you as a direct question.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:13.060]   In your walk as a Christian, in the years that you've come to church, in the years that
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:19.580]   you've been reading the Bible, have you grown in understanding God's heart?
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:24.420]   Has His thoughts rubbed off on you where you learn God's priorities?
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.140]   When you think about, "Hey, there's like a million things to do.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.980]   I have tons of responsibilities."
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.920]   What comes first?
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.700]   Are you able to resonate with God?
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.100]   This comes first.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.100]   Are you resonating with God and His value system, what's important and what's not?
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:43.540]   Are you resonating with God as what is shameful, what is not shameful, what is profitable to
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:48.340]   His church and His flock, what is profitable for the expansion of His kingdom?
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:57.340]   Are you able to test and see if you are growing in holiness, your taste buds then are going
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.340]   to grow?
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.260]   I want to give you an example of this.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:06.940]   If you guys ever, you know, cooked anything, you guys have probably gone to your kitchen,
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.660]   opened up your fridge, opened it all up, started looking around and grabbed the ingredients,
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.660]   right?
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:13.660]   And you do one of these.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:14.660]   Right?
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.220]   Is it good?
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:22.700]   And then for those of us who aren't in the kitchen much, you grab it and you go, "Is
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.700]   this good?"
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:24.700]   I'm like, "I don't know.
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.700]   Can we eat this?"
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:27.700]   Right?
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:33.300]   To the trained individual who is regularly cooking, they're going to, "Oh, no.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.460]   We're not in that."
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.500]   But what's most dangerous is an individual who is untrained, unfamiliar, smelling something
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.660]   and saying, "I think it's okay.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:47.540]   This chicken smells a little sour, but I think it's okay."
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:53.040]   And that is a major danger to the Christian church.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.600]   Individuals who are not practicing their discernment, individuals who are not practicing their sense
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.020]   of smell and saying, "I think it's okay."
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.020]   Why?
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.660]   Because when you think about the problem at hand, when we're saying practical holiness,
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:08.340]   the problem is toleration and syncretism.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:14.980]   And I'm using these words because the theme, the themes that come out in Leviticus is like,
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.460]   don't mix this stuff.
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.900]   If you guys have ever read some of those laws, it's like, "I don't want there to be cross
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.900]   marriages."
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.300]   And then it goes on to say, "I don't want you to cross breed animals."
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.060]   And it goes on to say, "I don't even want you to cross threads."
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.980]   Did you guys know that?
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.140]   Comes in chapter 19, verse 19.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.500]   Don't even use different kinds of threads.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:36.060]   And then he explains later, "Because I don't want there to be this toleration and syncretism
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:37.660]   of the idols and me."
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.800]   I'm like here, and they're there.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.860]   You should know the difference.
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.900]   But let's put it in layman's terms.
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:54.100]   Toleration and syncretism in layman's terms is, "I think it's okay."
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.340]   What is compromise?
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:36:00.020]   When you have a relationship where you're not supposed to be crossing physical boundaries,
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:04.460]   and then you do, your mind says, "I think it's okay because we're pretty much committed.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.500]   We're almost there."
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:13.500]   When you lax on your business stuff and your finances and all this stuff, in your mind,
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.340]   whether it be compromise, syncretism, whether it be tolerance, all we're saying is, "I
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.340]   know that there is a principle out there, but I think it's okay."
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.300]   It's like the guy.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.780]   It's been in there.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.780]   It's rotting.
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.700]   A little green.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:35.020]   Let's just cut that part off, and I think it's okay.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:40.140]   So that's why I'm emphasizing to us this need for every single one of us.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.460]   If we're going to be walking in practical holiness, you've got to be growing in your
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:52.020]   discernment what is and what is not, not simply permissible, but what is and what is not pleasing
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.020]   to God.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:37:01.080]   That's at the heart of your practical holiness, what is and what is not pleasing to God.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:07.620]   So starting to wrap things all up together, I think when we take a look at all this, I
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:12.260]   think one of the things that really needs to happen for every single one of us is that
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:18.860]   in our concept of holiness, we need to be challenged, that not only should we care,
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:26.080]   but we need to recognize that God cares tremendously about your holiness.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:31.060]   It is not rituals, principles that He wants you to abide by.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.740]   It's not simply do's and don'ts or golden rules.
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.540]   It's not a moral perspective.
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:41.700]   It is a relationship in which He wants you to be faithful to Him.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:45.820]   What's more, take a look at this passage in 2 Corinthians.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:52.780]   It says, "We all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of our Lord, are
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:59.420]   being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord the
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.100]   Spirit."
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:06.260]   If we know anything, God cares incredibly about His glory.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:10.860]   And what He is desiring to do is that in our practical growth in holiness, He's going to
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.660]   see the glory of God in our transformed lives.
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:14.660]   Amen?
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:25.100]   Let's take some time to pray.
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:28.620]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank You so much for Your Word today.
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:36.420]   God, we do ask that we would think properly about our pursuit of holiness.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:43.260]   We would think practically and also holistically about our pursuit of trying to be godly and
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.260]   obey Your commands.
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:49.660]   That God, we would do so with a heart full of love for You.
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:55.540]   We would do so with eyes wanting to see in greater light Your glory.
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:59.100]   And I pray, Father God, that You would continue then to transform our minds.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:04.780]   Lord, I ask again that, Lord, we would not be a generation that tolerates things that
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:08.700]   are dishonoring to You.
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:14.460]   But rather, God, we would be clear that there would be conviction and, Lord, there would
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.220]   be faithfulness to You.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.300]   Lord, we do ask for strength.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.420]   We are beset with weakness.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.180]   And Lord, just being honest, we're tempted almost daily.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.100]   Grant us strength, Father God, in Your Spirit.
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:33.420]   Grant us, Father God, perseverance in the name of Your Son that, Lord, day in and day
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.500]   out, we would continue to pursue strong and run strong after You.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.860]   Thank You in Christ's name we pray.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:40.860]   Amen.
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:41.860]   Okay.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:47.620]   So in terms of discussion questions, it's actually on your sheet and not on the PowerPoint.
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.780]   And there are three questions.
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:56.260]   Sometimes it's kind of hard, again, to get real specific, but I'm going to ask you guys
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.460]   to take the opportunity to be specific.
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:05.180]   And I wanted to ask you guys to take a current assessment of yourself.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:11.860]   Are you currently expressing a level of commitment that's visible beyond words?
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:16.140]   And please try to use some of these examples as like benchmarks maybe when we talked about
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.420]   sacrifice, growing appreciation.
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.500]   So talk about your relationship with God in that manner.
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.900]   And then the question is, how can we steadily grow in our imitation of God?
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.580]   Now that's a broad question, right?
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:32.740]   But maybe you can narrow it down by talking about like specifically if you've been a Christian
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:39.700]   for a long time, many years, how can we challenge ourselves to just not be plateauing but ever
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.300]   growing in that imitation of God?
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.580]   And what's more, even for a newer believer too?
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:52.460]   And then number three, are there any areas that you have been too permissive over what?
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.180]   I think I phrased that funny, but you guys know what I'm saying, right?
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.180]   Have you been too permissive?
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.180]   Period, maybe.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.380]   I got to run on sentences there.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.420]   Tolerating things that are displeasing to the Lord, you know?
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:08.100]   Maybe just kind of thinking there are things that maybe you do in private.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.100]   There is this term now, it's like not safe for work.
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:16.460]   Are you permitting yourself to watch stuff that's not safe for work but it's not necessarily
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.820]   bad so you're just permitting yourself?
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:23.260]   To talk about that kind of stuff and be specific if you can, okay?
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.420]   So those are the questions there.
