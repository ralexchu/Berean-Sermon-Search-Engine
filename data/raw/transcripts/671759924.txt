[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.800]   If you can turn your Bible to Hebrews chapter 13, 17, 18, and 19.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.120]   And we're going to be in part two on this text.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.440]   17, 18, and 19.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.440]   So last week our leaders got a shellacking.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.720]   So this week is your turn.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.760]   All right, so Hebrews chapter 13, 17, 18, and 19.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.240]   Obey your leaders and submit to them for they can watch over your souls as those who will
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.240]   give an account.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.800]   Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.040]   Pray for us for we are sure that we have a good conscience designed to conduct ourselves
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.800]   honorably in all things.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.800]   And I urge you all the more to do this so that I may be restored to you sooner.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.920]   Let's pray.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.960]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your grace.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.080]   We pray, Father God, that as we tackle this difficult text to apply, we truly ask for
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.640]   your wisdom and a softened heart, Lord God, to hear your thoughts, your voice, and practically
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.360]   how to apply this, Lord God, just asking for your guidance and your spirit.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.360]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.360]   Amen.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:32.440]   Well, let me read a song, the lyric of the song, that I think captures the spirit of
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.920]   not just our generation, but just kind of how we're taught ever since we're young.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.240]   And so this is a song from Frank Sinatra, "I Did It My Way."
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.160]   Okay, so some of you guys know, okay.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.800]   And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   My friend, I'll make it clear, I'll state my case of which I am certain.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.360]   I've lived a life that's full.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.320]   I traveled each and every highway and more, much more.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.680]   I did it, I did it my way.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.440]   Regrets, I've had a few, but then again, too few to mention.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.920]   I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.200]   I planned each charted course, each careful step along byway, and more, much, much more.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.520]   I did it, I did it my way.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.560]   For what is a man, what has he got?
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.320]   If not himself, then he has not.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.520]   Not to say the things that he truly feels, and not the words of someone who kneels.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.020]   The record shows I took all the blows, and I did it, I did it my way.
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.320]   Now this was a very, very popular song, and so the fact that some of you guys who are
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:48.280]   younger may even know this song, again, it speaks to the popularity of what he is saying.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:57.080]   In the end, the lyrics of what he says is the spirit of the rebellion of mankind, right?
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.800]   As catchy as the song is, and as popular as the song is, he says, I did it.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.280]   Everything I did, I charted my way.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.960]   I visited, and I did all of this, and in the end, sometimes I regretted it, but one thing
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.120]   I can say, I did it, and I did it my way.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.560]   Again, this is not just Frank Sinatra.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.160]   This is the spirit of mankind.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.600]   The Bible says that the reason why man has sinned and fall short of the glory of God
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.840]   is because he chose to do it his way.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.600]   He went against what God says.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.240]   Instead of doing God's way, he says, I'm going to do it my way.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:40.360]   How do we talk about this subject of submission and obedience when everything in our culture
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.480]   tells us to do it your way?
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:52.160]   If you hear athletes, you hear teachers, anybody who's made it in this world, and when they
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.680]   speak, one of the key things that they say, you have to believe who?
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.680]   In yourself.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.760]   You have to believe in yourself, and yet, everything that the scripture tells us is
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.000]   about submission.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.600]   I know that some of you have come from situations where you may have experienced trauma because
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.320]   of leadership, and so whenever you hear the term submission, I mean, even if you didn't,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.580]   the idea of submission and obedience is not well received in our culture, but especially
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.400]   if you have negative experience, which a lot of you do.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.680]   In fact, somebody told me that our church is known for people who've been burned out
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.880]   or been hurt, and so we have a lot of people who come to our church who's had issues, and
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.920]   so I don't know how they heard about it, but that was just our reputation.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:55.000]   In fact, somebody wrote this in one of their books and said that our church has that reputation.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.400]   A lot of you come from situations where you feel that you have been abused, so how do
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.480]   you accept this?
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.080]   This is one of those things that you just kind of want to black out.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.640]   Just teach me about Jesus and how to love Christ and the gospel, but submission to leaders
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.160]   and elders, it just doesn't sit right.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:25.360]   Well, it's in the scripture, and it's here for a reason, and I could tell you there are
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.400]   not many things that I can tell you is one of the most practical things to practice and
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   apply.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   You cannot have a church without the practice of what he says here, and so I'm going to
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.320]   use this morning to go over this, and I didn't get to finish in the first service, so I'm
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.680]   going to have to finish the second service.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.400]   I didn't want to go too long, and so I'm just giving you a heads up.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.840]   There is a part three to this.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.040]   Early on in church, we named our church Berean Community Church because we wanted to be like
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.040]   Bereans.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.560]   Bereans were people who tested, tested everything that the apostles were saying.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.620]   Is it really from the word of God?
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.080]   And so from the get-go, we said, "We're going to study the Bible, and if things pop up that
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.920]   we're doing, even if we've been doing it for 15, 20 years, if the word of God convicts
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.580]   us otherwise, we're going to change.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.280]   We're not going to just say, 'Well, this is what we've been doing, so it's too hard to
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.280]   change.'
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.720]   We're going to let the word of God dictate what we do."
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.500]   So if you look at most churches, they are divided into two ways of governing the church.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.440]   You have a congregational church, and you have an elder-run church.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.920]   Most churches fall into one of those categories.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.720]   A congregational church, basically all the say is given to the congregation.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.440]   And the passage that they use to say that is, "We have priesthood of believers.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.200]   We are a royal priesthood, a holy nation."
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.600]   And so therefore, all the people in the church have equal say as to how the church is run.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.480]   So things are always taken to a vote.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.440]   The budget, the direction, the staff, the leadership.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.600]   And so that's how a congregational church typically runs.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.640]   A congregation has certain committees, and those committees have the final say.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.160]   And so the elders and the leaders have to submit to those committees.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.360]   That's how a congregational church runs.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.800]   Earlier on in our church, because we're a Baptist church, and most Baptist churches are
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.600]   congregational, and that's how we ran the church for the first few years of the church,
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.160]   simply because that's what I was taught, and that's the model that I saw.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.800]   But as we were doing church and studying the scripture, we realized that the scripture
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.840]   does not teach that.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.920]   In fact, that text, when it says that the priesthood of believers is not talking about
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.880]   church polity.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.840]   It's just saying that this is who we are as an identity.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.480]   But that passage is not saying that this is how the church should be run.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.080]   In fact, it's exactly the opposite.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.560]   The reason why the elders are established is so that the elders can rule the church
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.480]   well.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:07.200]   So I believe, and I know there are good brothers that I fellowship with that may disagree with
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.600]   me, but that is not what we see in scripture.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.800]   So our church is an elder-run church.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.640]   And so as an elder-run church, just like if you're in a congregational church and the
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.480]   congregation is making the decisions for what the church does and does not do, you'd have
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.400]   to have a very proficient congregation who knows the Word of God, is committed, and has
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.720]   lordship because they are dictating the direction of the church.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.480]   So you cannot practice congregational church unless you have a high level of commitment
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.560]   and high level of surrender to the Word of God.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:47.600]   On the flip side, if you are an elder-run church, the elders must be above reproach,
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.920]   just like the Bible says.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:56.880]   And if you have elders that you cannot respect, if you have leaders that are not above reproach,
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:03.400]   he talks well, he may be a gifted speaker, he has a lot of knowledge, but there's a question
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.600]   over the character of the man, then you cannot practice an elder-run church.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.920]   That's why we have such high view of eldership and leadership in our church.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.480]   One of the common complaints that we get in the church through the years is, "Why do we
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.600]   not establish elders, more elders?"
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:26.000]   It is better to not have elders than to have wrong elders or not qualified elders in the
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   church.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.520]   The Bible says not to lay hands hastily because some men's sins are obvious, some men's sins
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.800]   trail behind them.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.920]   And it takes time to see.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.320]   Is the character of the man, is he consistent in the home and outside the home?
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:51.240]   Is he a Christian man at church, but he doesn't act like one at work?
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.960]   He's very charismatic and has strong leadership when he's at church, but when he's at home,
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.140]   that's not how he behaves.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.280]   He's great when everybody's in agreement, but as soon as there's a disagreement, there's
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.680]   a different side of him.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.360]   He has to be tested in every way so that we make sure that when an elder or leader is
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:17.520]   established that we can have confidence to establish that person as leaders in the church.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.160]   And so we have an elder-run church.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.040]   And so last week we talked about five things that a leader is called to.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.280]   One is that a leader is an under-shepherd.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.300]   We are not to give our own opinion.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.920]   No matter how strong we feel about something, it cannot be our opinion because we are under-shepherds.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.600]   I don't have the right to come up here and say, "Because I have so many experience in
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.280]   ministry, because I've experienced this, because this is how I was taught, you need to do this
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.120]   because I know better than you."
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:53.040]   And I'm telling you, that comes with no authority.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.480]   All I'm telling you, if that's the reason why I tell you what I tell you, all I'm telling
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   you is I'm smarter than you.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.960]   I'm better than you.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:07.160]   No one should submit to that because all we are are under-shepherds.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.460]   Under-shepherds mean that we are to represent Christ.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.600]   We are to speak as He speaks.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.840]   When He is silent, we are to be silent.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.320]   We are to go where He goes.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.640]   We are to do what He does.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.440]   But we cannot be self-willed, number one.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.560]   Number two, we have to teach the Word of God in season and out of season.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.640]   Whether people listen or don't listen, whether it scatters people or gathers people, we have
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.720]   to accurately teach the whole counsel of God.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.680]   Thirdly, we have to lead by example.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.880]   We cannot say, "Do what I tell you, but don't do what I do."
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.840]   The moment somebody, one of the leaders say that, that person is disqualified because
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.160]   part of leader, leading means that you have to be in the front and lead people to come
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.400]   the direction I'm going because this is the way to Christ.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.040]   So in the way He deals with finance, in the way He deals with His home, in the way He
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.280]   deals with in public, in private, at work, all of these, the elders and the leaders have
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.000]   to be an example, not just teachers, but an example of what that means.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.920]   Fourthly, He has to keep watch over the people of God.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.300]   Remember that the word watch means to not sleep.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:26.280]   So if a leader in the church is overly consumed with things that have nothing to do with God,
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.120]   He's not paying attention.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.640]   He's distracted.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:37.960]   So if you've ever taken a child to the swimming pool, you know that if you take your eyes
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.440]   off of them for a second, they're in danger of drowning.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:48.600]   So if you don't have children, I want you to pay attention very carefully.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.720]   Do not ever let somebody that is not used to watching children, especially around the
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:01.400]   water, because when children drown, they drown in seconds and they don't make any noise.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.000]   It's like fall off a cliff or they touch animals, you'll hear something, but at the pool or
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.540]   in the water, you don't hear anything.
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.200]   And all you have to do is to be distracted for a minute.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.280]   You're there and have a conversation with your friend, husband and wife.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:20.080]   Next thing you know, your child is just floating and it doesn't take long for a child to drown.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.880]   So if they are not used to watching children around water, it's not safe.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.760]   And so the Bible describes the leaders in the church who have to not sleep, of course,
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.100]   not physically, of course, we need to sleep.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.840]   Not sleep, meaning stay need to stay sober.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:42.360]   And that the things of God has to consume us and watch over the church.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.040]   So if we're not aware of what's going on inside the church, and you have wolves that are coming
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.680]   in, you have we're not aware of what's going on in our own hearts, then we're not we can't
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.360]   be watching the way that God called the leaders to watch.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.040]   And then fifthly, it says we need to give an account before God.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:04.360]   That these men have to function in life knowing that there is a stricter judgment.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.600]   We cannot live our lives like everybody else.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.220]   We are mere men.
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.240]   We have every struggle that you have.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.000]   We have struggled.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.040]   But the leaders have to stay sober knowing that there will be stricter judgment.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.120]   And so we need to take our situation very seriously.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.080]   So we this is just all a review of what we talked about last week.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.120]   I think many of you felt sorry for us because I got a bunch of emails saying we're praying
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.320]   for you.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.320]   It must be hard.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.320]   We're praying for you.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.320]   Yes.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.080]   Okay, so it worked.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:48.480]   But today, the second part of it is what is the responsibility of the church?
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.320]   Now all this with the premise understanding that we have to have a high view of the leadership.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:58.360]   But he says, first of all, just obey and submit to them.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.360]   Obey and submit to them.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:06.720]   Let me read you another song from Whitney Houston, a little bit more recent, recent
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.920]   meaning the last 40 years.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.680]   Right, Whitney Houston.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.280]   I couldn't find anything from BTS.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.560]   So this is as current as I can get.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.040]   All right, Whitney Houston.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.040]   It starts out by, "I believe the children are our future."
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.360]   Oh, sounds Christian.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.880]   "Teach them well and let them lead the way.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.920]   Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.280]   Give them a sense of pride to make it easier.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.960]   Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be."
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   How many of you know this song?
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.960]   How many of you know this song?
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.960]   Really?
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.960]   You're reluctant.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.400]   I really want to know how many of you know this song.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.000]   Not know me like you memorized it, but you know about this song.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Okay, so you know this song.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.040]   Majority of you know this song.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.000]   And you probably sang it when you go to karaoke bars.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.360]   You probably sing this, right?
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.160]   Maybe not really understanding the content of what she says.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.520]   She said, "Everybody's searching for a hero.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.800]   People need someone to look up to.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.720]   I never found anyone who fulfills my needs, a lonely place to be, and so I learned to
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.120]   depend on me.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.560]   I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadows.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.280]   If I fail, if I succeed, at least I'll live as I believe.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:23.240]   No matter what they take from me, they can't take away my dignity.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.680]   Because the greatest love of all is happening to me."
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.000]   So up to there, you would think, like, "Oh, she converted."
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Right?
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.080]   "I found the greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.320]   Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all."
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.400]   Right?
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:47.040]   This is rebellion blasphemy.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.680]   But this is what we sing in our generation, and sometimes not really knowing what we're
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.680]   singing.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.680]   Right?
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.680]   This is the spirit of our generation.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:03.120]   So within that spirit, it said, "At least, even if I fail, at least I have my dignity."
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.120]   And what does she mean by that?
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.120]   By dignity.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.120]   "I didn't fall.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.600]   I didn't give in.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.720]   I followed my path.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.720]   I did it my way."
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:19.280]   Because the greatest love of all that we need to teach everybody is to love yourself and
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.640]   do it your way.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:28.520]   So within that context, when you hear, "Obey your leaders and submit to them," how do you
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.520]   apply this?
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.680]   How do you convince people that this is necessary and this is important?
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.520]   So it's easy to kind of skirt around this, especially knowing that many of you have been
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.880]   hurt in the context of leaders in your life.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.000]   How do we apply this, and why is this here, and why is this important?
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.360]   Well, first of all, the word "obey."
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.960]   It doesn't sound as harsh when you see what it means in the Greek, because the word "obey"
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.920]   basically means to be persuaded.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.760]   Either to persuade or to be persuaded.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.640]   So if I am to ask you to obey, I'm basically trying to persuade you.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.600]   So every Sunday when I open up the Word of God, I'm trying to get you to be persuaded,
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.000]   to obey.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.320]   If you're the receiving person, it means to be easily persuaded, to be persuadable.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:23.320]   As the Bible says, that we are the clay and he is the potter, meaning that we come before
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.080]   the Lord asking for him to mold us and change us.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:34.360]   The word for "submit" basically means to put yourself under, to put things in order.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.640]   And so the idea of obeying and submitting is to place yourself in a position where you
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:45.640]   can easily take the commands that are coming from God through the leaders and to submit.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:52.560]   You know, this idea that we, I just, you know, those two songs that we, that I just kind
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.560]   of mentioned.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.280]   And at the end of the day, the Bible says when Adam and Eve rebelled against God, one
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.800]   of the chief things that God says is part of the curse is that the wife who was created
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.720]   to be a suitable helper, he said he's going to, she's going to have contention with her
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   husband.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.400]   He said her desire is going to be for her husband, meaning that word for desire means
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.400]   contention.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.080]   They're going to be fighting for control.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.240]   And so is it within that context, it's this idea of submission is not just about the church
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.240]   to leaders.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:30.880]   In fact, whenever we think about submission, right, in the context of the church, the conservative
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.880]   church, we normally think about, right, we normally think about wives submitting to husband,
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.680]   or at least that's kind of the context we hear all the time.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.280]   It says in Ephesians 5, 24, wives submit to your husbands.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:51.520]   I hear people saying that sometimes out of context and not really understanding what
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.360]   is being said.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.560]   A lot of times the husband's frustrated with their wives and they'll open up, you know,
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:02.280]   Ephesians 5, 24, and it says, right here, submit, submit.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.680]   You know what submit means?
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.280]   It means to submit, right?
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.880]   And I hear, I hear husbands using that text because he's frustrated.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   Maybe the wife is nagging her, not doing what he says.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.800]   Maybe they have a, they have a contention and they, you know, they don't agree on something.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:23.320]   And so he's using his muscles from the scripture.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.440]   I want you to understand the context of this, okay.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:31.640]   First of all, if you ever have to open up the scripture to your wife and say submit,
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.480]   you've already lost her, right?
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.800]   You've already lost her.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.760]   And the only reason why you're bringing that up is because she's having a hard time respecting
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.260]   you.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:48.880]   So the first thing that you should look at is what are you doing that is making it hard
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.280]   for her to follow you before you bring out the scripture.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:00.400]   But understand this, prior to Apostle Paul going into wives submitting to your husband,
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:07.360]   he actually says in Ephesians 5, 21, and be subject to one another in fear of Christ.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:12.560]   So this idea of submitting is to the husband and the wife.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:19.700]   That our general attitude should be to be agreeable, to learn to submit to one another.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:24.700]   And then he breaks into saying to the wife, you need to submit to your husband as the
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.660]   church does to Christ.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:31.880]   And the reason why they need to do that is because of the calling of the husband to sacrifice
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.440]   his life for his wife as Christ did for the church.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:42.840]   So the reason why the wife is called to submit is so that the husband can die for you.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.380]   That's the context.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:50.480]   So the general calling is for everyone to submit, but specifically for the purpose of
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.440]   building a family that honors God, where the husband can sacrifice, the woman needs to
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.920]   make it easier for him to do his job.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.360]   So whenever somebody whips out the Bible and says, look it here, and he's using it for
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.240]   selfish reasons, you've already shot yourself in the foot.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.760]   If the only way that you can get your wife to submit to you is to open up the scripture
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:17.160]   and say you must do this, again, you probably already lost your wife.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.480]   In Ephesians 6, 1 it says, children obey your parents.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.480]   First Peter 5, 5 it says, younger men submit to the older men.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.000]   Romans 13, 1, every person be subject to the governors.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.040]   Colossians 3, 22, slaves in all things obey those who are your masters on earth.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:43.620]   So the general disposition of everyone is called to be agreeable, to be easily molded.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.800]   Because the elders and the leaders are called to teach the word of God as under shepherds,
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.120]   that if you choose to challenge everything that is being taught, it is not profitable
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.560]   for you.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.760]   You know, everybody goes through different stages of maturity.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:06.480]   When you're first born, not just first born, but like born first, right, when you're born,
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.480]   every human being goes through dependency.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.640]   You can't survive by yourself.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.120]   Your parents have to teach you how to walk, to eat, to go to the bathroom, and so that's
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.280]   a dependent stage, right?
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:25.320]   So spiritually, when you first become a Christian, you need other Christians to tell you, this
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.520]   is the Bible, these are the doctrines, this is what God calls us, this is the church.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.920]   And so that's the dependent stage.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:38.640]   The dependent stage is very difficult because it requires a lot of attention, right?
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.640]   And you need to basically watch them constantly.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.000]   You're at the water, you gotta watch them.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.440]   You gotta watch what they eat, you gotta tell them when to sleep, when to wake up.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:51.300]   But they're also the cutest period, during that period, because they don't know any better.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.600]   The next stage is independence, right?
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:00.080]   And that's the teenage stage, where you learn to wipe your butt and eat your food, take
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.160]   your own shower, and all of a sudden, you've learned everything.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.640]   That's the stage where your parents become the source of your information, and then all
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.080]   of a sudden, they don't know Jack.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:18.040]   It's interesting because during that period, you see children kind of going through that
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:24.360]   period and if you see your kids fighting with one another, and I would walk into the room
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.680]   and let's say, you know, Jeremy and Zachary is fighting and then Zachary, when he's a
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.080]   little kid, he was like, "Daddy, Jeremy's saying this, is that true?"
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.080]   And I would say, "No."
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.080]   He's like, "See?"
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.080]   And it's over.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:42.960]   They don't look up encyclopedia, they don't go to Google, it's like, is he correct?
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.620]   It's like, if I say it's not true, it's like, "Daddy said it," so that settles it.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:51.160]   And then they get into adolescence and all of a sudden, they say, "Hey, hey, you shouldn't
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.360]   be doing that because this is the way things work," and then Zachary would turn to his
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.360]   older brother, Jeremy, he's like, "Jeremy, is that true?"
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.360]   And Jeremy's like, "Yeah, I don't know."
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:03.160]   He's like, "I don't know about that."
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:08.000]   So truth is determined during that adolescent period, all of a sudden, you have to challenge
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.920]   your parents to see because they're starting to try to figure out how the rest of the world
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.440]   works, and that's the teenage stage.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.520]   That's where you're deep independent.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.280]   People go through periods where they become independent, where they were dependent, they
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.200]   know enough about scripture, they've kind of lived their Christian life, and they've
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.440]   seen the good, they've experienced this and that, and so it's like, "What do the leaders
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.440]   know?
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.600]   They're no different than us.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.600]   They have faults.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.280]   We don't submit to any man."
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.720]   So that's the deep independent stage.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:43.380]   Can you imagine what the world would be like with just teenagers?
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:49.440]   Can you imagine what Disneyland would be like with just teenagers?
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.520]   I know some of you guys are teenagers here, right?
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:26:03.680]   18, maybe as young as 17, 18, 19, and I'm sure it doesn't apply to you, right?
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:09.160]   And that's why you're at this church, because you've matured, and you want the word of God,
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:14.740]   and you are coming out of your dependent stage to the final stage of maturity, and the final
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.880]   stage of maturity was interdependence.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:25.400]   Interdependence are people who are independent who chooses to submit to one another.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:31.300]   That's the final stage, where you have a relationship with your children as adults.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.960]   They have their own mind, they have their own, they're mature enough to take care of
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.200]   them, but we're able to have a relationship where we can talk to them, "Hey, you have
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.040]   some things and I have some things," but you choose to submit to one another, because
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.420]   only way that you can function in a society is if that happens.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:56.620]   So when you grow, you choose to submit, right, to your boss, you choose to submit to society,
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:02.040]   you choose to submit to your husband, you choose to submit to the leaders, and so even
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.480]   though I am able to be independent, I choose to be dependent, because that's the final
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.640]   stage of maturity, interdependence.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:18.840]   So this idea of obeying and submitting is not because the top, most holiest men are
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.840]   the leaders.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.560]   It's because of the job that we are called to do.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.280]   It is a high calling.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:29.760]   It says they need to be above reproach, but in order for the leaders to do their job and
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.760]   to do it well, the church needs to submit.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:40.160]   And again, like I said, it's one of the most tangible things that the church can do in
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.200]   order to build a healthy church.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.440]   Why do we need to submit?
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.680]   Why is the church called to submit?
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:49.540]   Verse 18, it said, "Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.720]   unprofitable for you."
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.720]   If you are a nurse or you're in the healthcare, right, and this would be true of anybody who's
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.000]   taking care of other people, right, but let me just use that as an example.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.120]   If you're a nurse and you go into the room and you need to give them medicine, you need
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.280]   to turn them around, wipe them, clean them up, and you need to make sure that they're
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.080]   taking the pills and do the, and then the patient's just cranky.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.280]   No, I'm not going to take that.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.680]   I'm not going to turn around.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.020]   I'm not going to move.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:25.400]   And they refuse you, say, "Don't tell me what to do."
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.440]   In the end, who are they hurting?
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.680]   They're hurting themselves.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:35.400]   And so, you know, because of the job that the nurse is called to do, if the patient
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:41.200]   is not compliant, the first person that gets hurt by that is the patient.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.800]   It makes the job very difficult for the nurse, but it makes it impossible to treat that patient
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.620]   if he refuses.
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.620]   That's how he describes it.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:55.560]   He said, "Let them do this with joy," because they've been called to sacrifice.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.900]   They've been called to watch.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.220]   They've been called to represent Christ.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:06.680]   So if the leaders are here for the purpose of the well-being of the church, and you refuse,
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:11.040]   and you challenge everything that happens, and they said, "It's not profitable for
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.000]   you in the end."
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.880]   Remember how whenever the Israelites would rebel, remember how God would describe the
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.720]   Israelites, right?
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.160]   They would say they are stiff-necked, right?
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.160]   Stiff-necked.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.040]   You know, whenever I hear that term stiff-neck, obviously it's pride.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.400]   It's somebody who's kind of like stiff.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.420]   Stiff meaning like they will not bow.
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.480]   They will not yield.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.480]   I know.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.880]   So this is always your stance, right?
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.760]   "Well, what are you doing?
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.760]   Why are you doing that?"
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.080]   That's the description that Bible gives.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.940]   A stiff-necked person is never willing to yield because, "I have my idea.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.840]   This is my opinion."
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:59.560]   That's how the Bible describes an unyielding nation, stiff-necked.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:04.120]   And if you own dogs, you know, every once in a while you'll see the owners taking the
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.640]   dogs out to a walk, and the dogs are up in the front, and the owner is just kind of being
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.640]   guided.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.160]   But every once in a while you'll see a dog who doesn't want to go, and you see the owner
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.880]   dragging the dog.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.080]   The dog's not happy because he's being dragged.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.120]   Owner's not happy because the owner has to drag the dog.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.800]   But this has to be done because you're going to poop in the house if you don't.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:36.600]   That's how the Bible describes a nation that is stiff-necked, unyielding.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:43.360]   Working with unyielding people is like working with cement.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.160]   Somebody told me years ago, we had a pastor that came to our church, and he spent a lot
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.280]   of time just venting about his church.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.400]   He was like, "Yeah, I can't believe they did this."
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.960]   And he just went off.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:00.040]   Then after that retreat, somebody came up to me and said, "Hey, Pastor Peter, how come
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.120]   you don't tell us about the church?
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.960]   How come you don't vent to us?"
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.400]   I said, "Because if I vent, it would be about you."
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.600]   That pastor's at our church, so I vent when I'm over there.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:24.880]   So if you want to hear me vent, come with me to the retreat.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:33.040]   I have so much to say, and I'm trying to be careful.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:42.160]   But the job that we have been called to do is impossible to do if people are stiff-necked.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:49.040]   Let me give you three practical things that the church has to submit to and obey in order
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.520]   for the church to be healthy.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:57.560]   First of all, and this is the easiest of them all, is that you need to obey the teaching
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.800]   of the Word of God.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.740]   We said we put a high premium on the teaching and preaching of God's Word.
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:09.360]   If I ever stand here and say, "You need to do this because this is my experience, and
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.000]   this is what I know.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.040]   I went to seminary.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.080]   I was a Bible major undergrad, so you just need to trust me, and you just need to do
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.080]   this," I said, "There's not much authority there."
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:24.760]   Because somebody else can say that and say, "Well, I'm older than you.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.760]   You got a master's.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.240]   I got a doctorate."
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.000]   And anybody can use whatever position that they have to supersede.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.640]   "Oh, I got an MBA, so I know how to do this more than you."
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.200]   Our authority does not come from ourselves or our experience but the Word of God.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:45.240]   And so when the Word of God is clearly taught, if you have a problem with what is being said,
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.720]   challenge us by the Word of God.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:52.160]   Don't come and say, "I just don't agree with you because I just know better."
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.160]   There's not much authority.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.360]   There's not much authority of that when I say it, and there's not much authority when
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.680]   you say it.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.680]   Because in the end, all it sounds like is, "I'm smarter, smarter than you, smarter than
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.760]   you, better than you, more talented than you, so you should listen to me."
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.600]   That's what it sounds like to me.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.720]   So there's no authority in that.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:17.160]   I would not preach that way, nor is it convincing if you say it.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.600]   But if the Word of God is open and it is clear and you're convinced that's what the Word
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.960]   of God says, then you have to obey.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.000]   Because obeying that isn't about obeying us.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.160]   It's about obeying the Word of God.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:37.640]   I've had people, years ago, I've had this young lady come to me and say, "You know what?
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.680]   I don't think God wants me to evangelize."
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.160]   I said, "What do you mean by that?"
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.480]   She's like, "I mean, Scripture says here, here, here, here."
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.880]   And she says, "God understands me."
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.480]   You're being legalistic, but God understands me.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.920]   He knows my heart.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.860]   He knows how difficult it is for me.
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.860]   He knows how hard it is for me.
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:03.440]   And so God understands, even though the Word of God says it's like, well, I mean, you choose
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:08.800]   to make the Word of God subjective and you kind of pick and choose what you want to obey.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   So that's the first thing.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:14.080]   And that's the easiest, because that's where the Word of God clearly spells it out, right?
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.080]   Obey the Word of God.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.640]   Secondly, and this is the part where the rubber meets the road, right?
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.400]   There are things that we are doing in the church that if the church doesn't cooperate,
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.900]   we just cannot run the church.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.160]   As an example, we decide to buy the building.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.600]   And you say, "You know what?
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.260]   I don't know if buying the building is a good idea."
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.740]   And I know some people, just the fact that we spent money, a lot of money, that's just
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:43.740]   ungodly.
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:47.440]   Just the fact that church is about doing God's work, so you can give it to missionaries and
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.160]   feed the poor, but buying a building seems very secular.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.560]   But we have to make these decisions.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.920]   Even though the Bible doesn't say you need to have a building, there's a lot of logistical
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:02.920]   business decisions that we need to make for the sake of the church.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.280]   We're not saying that every decision that we make is perfect.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:12.160]   We're not even saying that every decision that is being made is the best decision.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.800]   But we have been given the task to make these decisions.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:20.720]   And so we have to do our best to make these decisions that sometimes you may not agree
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.420]   with.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:27.280]   But we cannot run the church if the people in the church are constantly saying, "Well,
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.600]   that's not what I believe, and I'm just going to protest this."
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.320]   Let me give you an example.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:38.720]   How many of you have ever run games at a picnic?
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.160]   You guys are traumatized, so you're unwilling to admit it.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:47.920]   If you've ever run games, even once, I can almost guarantee that you came out of that
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:51.560]   saying, "I'm never doing this again."
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:57.420]   Because what typically happens is you run games, and no matter how well the game is
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:04.900]   run, there's always somebody who's going to say, "What is this?
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.860]   Who came up with this idea?
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.860]   This is not fun.
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.540]   Why are we doing this?"
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.140]   And there's always somebody who's going to protest.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:20.580]   But the thing is, the person who's running the games has poured his heart out, get the
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.500]   games ready to benefit the church.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.100]   We're going to have fun.
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.380]   But there's always somebody there who's doing that.
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:37.140]   And not to say that, don't ever say anything bad, but you have to either lead or follow
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.580]   or get out of the way.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:44.060]   And if you're not doing one of those things, you're a troublemaker, because that's all
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.060]   you're doing.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.060]   You're not going to lead.
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.060]   "No, no, no."
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.060]   "Oh, I'll come with a joke."
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.060]   "You want to lead?"
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.060]   "No, no, no."
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.060]   "Oh, I don't want to lead."
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.060]   Right?
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.060]   Then follow.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.060]   "I can't follow.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.060]   You want me to follow that?"
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:37:04.540]   So if you're not going to lead, if you're not going to follow, the next best thing is
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.380]   don't be there.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.220]   Let them run it, even if you don't like it.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:13.780]   But when you don't lead and when you're not following and you're refusing to get out of
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.500]   the way, you're saying, "I'm going to show up to the park.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.980]   I'm not going to participate, but I'm going to make sure everybody knows how this stinks."
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:22.980]   Right?
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.700]   "I'm just going to cause a stink."
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.700]   Right?
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:33.980]   And yeah, these are not maybe biblical things, but these are things that needs to happen
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.860]   in order for the church to run.
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:41.900]   But basically, you've committed to make it difficult for other people to lead.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.900]   And that's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.260]   Let me give you another illustration.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:54.660]   You ever have a group of friends that you get together and you decide where to eat?
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:59.420]   And you have this one friend who just, "I can't eat pho.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.460]   I don't like boba.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.460]   Pizza's too greasy.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.820]   You know, I'm lactose intolerant.
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:06.820]   I'm gluten.
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:07.820]   I got to be gluten free.
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:08.820]   I don't like pepper.
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:09.820]   It's too spicy.
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.820]   It's not spicy enough."
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.980]   And so at the end of the day, so what do you want?
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:15.980]   You want to eat.
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:16.980]   Right?
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:21.740]   So every time you gather together, you can only eat what that person wants to eat.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.860]   Eventually you get tired of that.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:30.220]   And then you, "Don't invite that guy."
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.740]   It's just too hard to do anything with that guy around.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:34.740]   Right?
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:43.060]   So everybody has to submit and to give in to that person who's just being selfish because
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.620]   they don't know how to give in to other people.
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.520]   Or here's another scenario.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:53.140]   You have two people in the group like that.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.340]   I cannot and the other person is like, "I don't like, I have to eat pho.
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:59.020]   I can't eat pho."
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.020]   How can you?
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:05.100]   So what ends up happening is the group gets divided.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.540]   Pho lovers and pho haters.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.620]   Right?
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:16.100]   And then you have pho-lo-ship over here and then you have the pho haters over there.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:24.140]   And then so you have that group split in two by two strong headed selfish people.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.660]   That's what happens in the church.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:32.900]   If we give in to selfishness in the congress, "Oh yeah, they won't let us do it."
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:38.480]   Yeah, because if we give in to you, that means everybody has to give in to you.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.840]   Everybody has to do what you say.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:47.940]   So sometimes we need to deal with hard headed people for the sake of the church.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:53.820]   If you have that in the eldership, you have two hard headed people who are so strong headed
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.180]   and they will not back down.
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.480]   That's how the church splits in two.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:03.440]   So when we call for submission, the submission is not just for the congregation to submit
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.440]   to the elders.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.640]   It's for the church to submit to each other.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:12.280]   That even though we have multiple of leaders, if the majority of the leaders decide one
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:17.060]   thing, every leader has to submit to that, including myself.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.960]   I may be the senior pastor of this church, but I cannot unilaterally make decisions in
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:26.480]   this church because I need to be submitted to the rest of the leaders in the church.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:31.760]   So for practical reasons, the church needs to submit to the decisions that are being
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.560]   made in the church because we're making decisions for what's beneficial for the church.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.800]   So like I said, you may have never led the church, so you may not fully understand what
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:48.400]   I'm saying, but if you led anything, like games, if you've ever tried to serve somebody
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:53.360]   for their own benefit, if you've ever raised children, you know exactly why this is such
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:57.280]   a practical, practical command.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:02.600]   Now if you have a leadership who is selfish, self-willed, and they're not walking right
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:08.200]   with God, they're distracted constantly, it says, do not entertain an accusation against
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.520]   an elder.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:15.440]   If you hear slander and things that are being said that is hurtful to the leadership, and
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.060]   then it's hurtful to the church, challenge them.
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:28.340]   If it's true, then bring it to the church because accusation against a leader will hurt
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.140]   the church if it's not true.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:35.780]   If the accusation against a leader is true and the church does nothing about it, it will
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.080]   hurt the church.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:44.660]   And so for practical reasons, right, to bring submission.
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.740]   And then third and final thing is church discipline.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:56.620]   In the 25 years of our church, we've had situations where people were unrepentant and it's risen
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:02.380]   to a certain degree and we'd have to threaten with church discipline to bring them into
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.420]   submission.
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:08.060]   Most of the time, it's enough where we didn't have to bring it to the church.
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:12.020]   We've had one instance where we actually had to bring it to the church years ago.
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:16.180]   So in 25 years, we had one church discipline.
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:22.060]   So we take this very seriously because we know not only is it embarrassing, it also
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:27.540]   causes friction in the church because, "Oh, how can a church do that?
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.600]   It's so unloving."
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:34.420]   Because you have a concept of church where you do whatever you want and there's no consequence.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:39.200]   No, church is the temple of God and the spirit of God dwells in it.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.940]   And the Bible says that he who destroys the temple will be judged by God.
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:49.260]   So we have to be gatekeepers of the church to make sure that this church and the community
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:53.120]   and the life of the church doesn't become more and more like the world.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:59.200]   So there are times we need to fight individual sins in the church so that we keep this at
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:05.380]   bay, that this church is the church of Christ, that we do not represent the world.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:11.740]   Now, having said that, I don't know anybody who has been confronted with their sins who
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.820]   feels good about it.
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:18.540]   Most ideal situation is they repent and say, "Thank you for turning me from my sins."
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:22.740]   But a lot of times what happens is when we try to bring attention of sin, they'll turn
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:26.120]   it around and say, "You're judging me."
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:30.780]   And then they'll begin to start to spread things and say things to other people.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:38.080]   If we feel that this is important enough that we raise it to church discipline, the church
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:43.100]   needs to obey and submit to the leadership.
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:46.380]   Now why is that important?
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.300]   Because we cannot carry out church discipline.
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.540]   Who'd want to be in this situation?
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:56.180]   I'd rather be where you are, where I don't have to deal with this.
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:00.620]   I'll let the other people make this decision, let them carry it out because it gets murky
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:05.820]   and dirty and then accusations come against us whenever we make even an attempt to do
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:10.460]   this because if we love you and gracious and we just sweep everything under the rug, you
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.940]   know, then every time we do that, it's like, "Oh, the church is so gracious, people are
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:14.940]   so loving."
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:20.420]   But anytime we try to bring attention to any kind of sin, we know that that's going to
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.500]   be reversed and accusations are going to come our way.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.460]   So who'd want to do this?
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:30.060]   But it must be done because one, it's taught by scripture and second, we need to keep the
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.940]   church holy.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:35.940]   As much as it needs to be gracious and loving, it also needs to be holy.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:41.780]   So if the church chooses to carry out discipline and the congregation in the church is saying,
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:45.640]   "Oh, those bad people are doing that to you," right?
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:49.980]   It's no different than a father disciplining a child and the mother embraces the child
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.220]   and saying, "Oh, your dad, your dad's doing that.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.260]   Let me go buy you some ice cream."
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:00.180]   Is that a loving, gracious thing to do for the mother to go against the discipline of
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.180]   the father?
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.180]   No.
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:08.460]   It's one of the most selfish things to do because you're not helping that child.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:12.620]   You're not helping that child to understand what he needs to turn his sins from because
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:18.220]   "Oh, those are bad people, those are bad people, but I'm gracious."
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.460]   We're loving.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:27.180]   If we have a church that resists when church discipline needs to take place, you cannot
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:30.260]   have a healthy church.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:34.700]   So that's why we say if we're in a habit of bringing discipline to the church for any
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:39.940]   little thing that happens in the church, yeah, then we would probably lose authority to carry
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.100]   this out.
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:47.180]   But when in rare situation where someone is unrepentant to the point where we need to
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:52.340]   bring this to the church, we need to have the cooperation of the church.
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:59.460]   One, because the scripture says so, and two, the church cannot be healthy if the congregation
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:06.340]   chooses, "Oh, the dirty work, we'll let the leaders do the dirty work, those bad people,
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.340]   but I'm gracious.
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.180]   Come over to my house, I'll make you dinner.
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.180]   I'll buy you..."
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:14.660]   It's like, "Because I'm not like them."
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.580]   That's not loving, that's not gracious.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:20.220]   Not only does it hurt that person, it hurts the church.
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:28.700]   And I know this is a difficult thing to swallow, but the church cannot be holy and it cannot
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:34.500]   be healthy unless this is carried out by the whole church.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:39.260]   The Bible says if the sin rises to the point they're unrepentant and it's hurting themselves
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:42.340]   and hurting the church, and the church decides that, "You know what?
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:47.140]   This discipline needs to happen to bring them to repentance, and we ask of you to only to
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:53.340]   associate with them, to bring them to repentance, and you blow us off," you're not just hurting
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:56.700]   that person, you're also hurting yourself and you're hurting the church.
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:05.740]   Again, I say this with clarity and with authority because my conscience is clear, because this
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.420]   is what the Bible teaches.
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:16.540]   Our church cannot, it cannot allow what is circulating around the world in our culture
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:22.780]   into the church, because it is constantly biting at the door.
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:26.140]   Sin is constantly biting at the door.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.380]   It's always knocking.
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:33.460]   There's never a time when sin and world and our enemy is not trying to knock through the
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:37.460]   door to pervert our church.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:44.900]   And so the leaders have been placed in the church to guard the church, but we cannot
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:54.100]   do our job if the people within the church keeps opening the door when we shut it.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:48:00.820]   Now I'm going to wrap up here.
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.700]   The next part is prayer, which I'm not going to get to.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.980]   I'm just going to wrap it up here.
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:12.340]   There's nothing more practical that needs to be practiced by the church.
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:15.580]   Everything sounds great, it's like, "Oh, we're going to worship God and we're going
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.140]   to do this, we're going to evangelize."
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:21.860]   All these things feel good, but where the rubber meets the road is where this application
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:24.460]   happens because we need to move together.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:28.780]   You can't just be bystanders watching and saying, "Well, I have my values and I have
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:29.780]   my things."
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:37.120]   You ever hear advice from the world about marriage?
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.380]   Women are from Mars and men are from Venus.
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:43.820]   I forget which one is which, so I might have switched it, right?
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:48.860]   And so the whole counsel that you get from the world is how do people from Venus communicate
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:52.140]   with people from Mars?
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.780]   It's a formula for disaster.
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.780]   You know why?
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.780]   What are you doing on Mars?
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:03.380]   What are you doing on Mars?
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:07.080]   You're not, you weren't made to be on Venus.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.740]   You belong on Earth.
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:15.060]   So the whole point of it is to bring you back to Earth.
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:19.780]   But if you get into marriage and say, "I'm from Venus, so this is what I like," and then
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:23.300]   you have another person, "But I'm from Mars."
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:27.420]   So what you end up doing is you end up going from relationship to relationship, from church
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:33.340]   to church, from group to group, looking for people to accommodate you.
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.100]   Looking for people to, "This is who I am.
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:41.900]   So I want to look for a church that's going to allow me to be me."
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.340]   You can't do that in marriage.
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:48.780]   If you do that in marriage, you're going to have a very difficult marriage because you
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:53.460]   have two selfish people demanding the other person to adjust to them.
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:57.960]   But the whole purpose of our sanctification is these two people who went astray and landed
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:03.720]   in Venus and Mars, God is trying to bring them to himself.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:11.180]   And so the church is God calling people who have strayed to get back to God.
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:15.220]   So if we are not willing to change, if we're not willing to submit, if we're not willing
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:23.260]   to obey and we are stiff-necked, you're going to flip that around and say, "This is who
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:28.200]   I am and I need other people to change for me."
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:31.080]   That's a formula for disaster.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:38.800]   And so as difficult as this teaching may be for some of you, understanding it, in the
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.480]   world this is ridiculous.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:48.960]   It's just arrogant to think, to submit to your husband, to masters, to government, to
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:49.960]   submit.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:58.160]   And yet, this is one of the most beautiful words in scripture.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:05.440]   Because he who in every way was God did not consider equality with God something to be
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.720]   grasped, but he emptied himself.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.040]   He humbled himself.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.540]   And he walked among us.
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:17.200]   It is by his submission that you and I are saved.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.440]   God is glorified when we learn to yield.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:24.960]   God is glorified when we become like clay.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.280]   We'll deal with the second part next week.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.280]   Let's pray.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:43.360]   Heavenly Father, we know how difficult this is.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:48.880]   That even now, Father God, that maybe we're all brothers and sisters who are uncomfortable
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:55.760]   with this very teaching because of the pain that they've experienced in the past.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:03.560]   I pray that you would give wisdom, restoration, knowing Father God that it is only by your
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:09.000]   grace that we can build a church that honors and glorifies you.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:16.080]   Lord, despite our weaknesses, despite our tendency to wander, we know that it's because
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:20.160]   you made the promise that you will build the church and the gates of Hades will not be
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.200]   able to prevail against it.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:27.380]   Help us, Lord God, to anchor ourselves to Christ, that we would not drift by every wind
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:34.080]   of doctrine and that this church would be a church where Christ is the head and that
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:38.120]   we have a high view of the church, high view of you, high view of leadership, high view
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:45.560]   of the word of God, that this kingdom that you inaugurated would continue to magnify
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.240]   and glorify Christ.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:53.920]   And as the world and its wickedness becomes more and more evident, and as you warned
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:59.280]   us, Lord God, that love of many will grow cold, help us, Lord God, to be a greater and
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.440]   greater light in the darkness that we are in.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.920]   May your name and your name alone be.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:08.920]   Thanks for watching.
