[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.220]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 15, verse 22 to 27, and I'm going
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.800]   to read that one more time with us before we jump in.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.640]   Romans chapter 15, verse 22 and on.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.960]   For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you, but now with no further
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.960]   place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.840]   to you, whenever I go to Spain, for I hope to see you in passing and to be helped on
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.040]   my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.440]   But now I'm going to Jerusalem serving the saints.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.240]   For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.600]   the saints in Jerusalem.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.880]   Yes, they were pleased to do so, and they are indebted to them, for if the Gentiles
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.040]   have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to minister to them also in material
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.040]   things.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.040]   Let's pray.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:04.200]   Gracious and loving Father, we come before you corporately to worship and honor you.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.160]   We desire more than anything else to meet with you, to hear from you.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.480]   We pray that your word, Lord God, would become clearer to us, that what we give to you would
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.200]   be a reasonable response to all that we know and believe that you've done for us.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.240]   Bless this time, Lord God, that we have come to bless you.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.240]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.240]   Amen.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.240]   All right.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.720]   So, as you guys know, if you've read this passage before you came, like this is one
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.040]   of those texts that typically if you're studying through the Book of Romans, we get to this
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.120]   part of chapter 15, and then chapter 16, you just kind of skim over it.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.320]   It's almost kind of like he's done with the letter, you know, this is why I'm doing what
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.880]   I'm doing, so bye, I'll see you later, say hi to these people, and then the letter ends.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.200]   Typically, if you're not careful, you may read that and just skim through, because he's
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.800]   done with all of his main teachings about justification, salvation by grace alone, and
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.720]   the ramification of that, and what happened after that, and what should we hope for.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.360]   Therefore, we need to give a proper response to live our lives as a living sacrifice.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.120]   So he's done all of that, and now chapter 15, he's kind of wrapping up.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.680]   But it is not to our benefit for us to skim through this process, because Apostle Paul,
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.400]   in this chapter, particularly in this section, is telling us that this is the reason why
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.280]   he wrote the letter.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.060]   So we get a glimpse of who he is, we get a glimpse of his ministry, we get a glimpse
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.400]   of the early church and their activity and what that looked like.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.560]   And so we need to understand that Apostle Paul, this whole letter was written in the
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.440]   context of him preparing to go further out his ministry.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.900]   He said in the previous text that we looked at last week that he spent about 10 years
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.720]   doing ministry somewhere between Jerusalem to Ilikriam, which is about a thousand mile
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.820]   distance, and we know that Paul, in his official status, made about three separate journeys.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.040]   Just the trip alone, even if he wasn't planting churches and stayed there and was laboring
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.360]   and raising up leaders, even just visiting physically, that would have drained anybody.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.440]   I mean, just looking at his travel itinerary, it would have been enough for any human being
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.600]   to look at that and say, "Wow, this guy really traveled a lot."
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.320]   But in 10 years, he poured his life out and doing ministry.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.520]   Now he says, because he's been so diligent, he's run out of places to preach the gospel,
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.120]   not that every single individual heard the gospel, but the areas that he's been targeting,
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.920]   he's already finished, he's finishing up, and now he's trying to expand his ministry
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.520]   beyond Ilikriam to stop by Rome to get some support and move on to Spain.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.300]   So that's the whole reason why he wrote this letter.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.460]   So it is in the context of his mission work, his ministry and preaching the gospel in which
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.460]   he writes this letter.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.200]   Now, the reason why this is so, so important is because not only the book of Romans is
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.240]   written in the context of mission work, the whole Bible is written in the context of God
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.680]   pursuing sinners.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.540]   So if you study the Bible to find out how to have a healthy family, what does it mean
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.180]   to manage your money well, how to raise your kids so that they love Christ, you can do
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.180]   all of that.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.960]   But all of those things are sub-points in the major, major theme of the Bible, which
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.000]   is pursuing of sinners, being reconciled with the holy God, and how to get this gospel out
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.780]   to the remotest part of the world.
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.680]   So if that is not your paradigm, if that's not your commitment, you will not understand
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.180]   what he is writing.
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.180]   It is no different than reading a book of 22 chapters and just kind of skimming through
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.500]   and taking a chapter here, a chapter there, and a chapter in the end, and then kind of
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.820]   just reformulating what you want it to say.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.360]   And you can kind of twist it to say anything that you want.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.540]   But if you read it systematically from Genesis to Revelation, all of it is in the context
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.620]   of missions.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.460]   So if missions is not in your heart, if mission is not your purpose, if mission is not your
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.640]   goal, Book of Romans will not make sense.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.980]   Because the purpose of why he wrote this was so that a proper understanding of what they
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:24.780]   believe would lead to a living sacrifice, which will ultimately lead to spreading of
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.500]   the gospel.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.740]   If we are not committed to this in our mind, in our thoughts, in our will, in our life,
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:41.500]   the way we raise our children, the way we use our finances, fellowship simply becomes
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.980]   friendship.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:49.060]   Again, we have a tendency to call any gathering of Christians, we just call it fellowship.
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.740]   That's what we made it into, but the scripture makes it very clear.
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.140]   Fellowship, koinonia, means to partner together.
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.980]   So when Christians get together, spend a lot of time, and you become friends with a bunch
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.900]   of people, that doesn't make it fellowship.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.800]   You've become friends.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.420]   Without the context of missions, partnering together to get the gospel out, you just have
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.740]   a lot of friends that you spend a lot of time with.
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.060]   Prayer meetings simply becomes meditation.
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.940]   Think about how much of the content of our prayer is asking God to protect our wealth,
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.700]   protect our health, protect our families.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.760]   That we can work hard and I want to achieve this goal and I'm praying that God would help
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.300]   me to get that.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.380]   How much of our prayer life is based upon those things.
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.340]   The scripture doesn't say that you shouldn't pray for these things, but the primary prayer
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.980]   of the early church was about missions.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.220]   To ask God for help, to open doors, to be bold in preaching the gospel, to be a light
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.900]   that God intended the church to be.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.540]   Bible study becomes nothing more than learning information.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.340]   We're Christians, so we should know what Leviticus says.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.260]   I've been a Christian for a while, so I should be better versed at the things that I profess
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.340]   to believe.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.620]   You gain a lot of knowledge coming to church, hearing a lot of sermons, attending a lot
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.540]   of Bible studies.
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.100]   But Bible study was never meant to simply inform the church.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.420]   It was for the purpose of equipping.
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:33.620]   That's why the scripture says that it is useful and profitable for teaching, rebuking, training
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.740]   and righteousness that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.300]   It was for the purpose of equipping.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.960]   Equipping for what?
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.100]   Equipping so that we can have a better life?
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.260]   Equipping so that we can be a better businessman?
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:54.340]   Possibly, but the primary purpose of Bible study is to equip us to be a better light,
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.060]   to be a better witness to the world.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.580]   So if we're not committed to the missions, if we're not committed to disciple making,
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.300]   if we're not committed to be a light, and we're not being intentional in doing that,
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.500]   Bible study probably has become old to you already.
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.180]   Every once in a while, you might study something that's kind of interesting.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.140]   "Oh, I didn't know that."
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.300]   And it might have just interested you.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:24.260]   But you're no better equipped knowing or not knowing, because your intention was not to
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260]   be equipped to do anything.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.060]   It's just to know.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.380]   It's just to say that you have more knowledge.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:37.660]   Without missions as the primary fuel that pushes us and guides us, Bible study becomes
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.020]   nothing more than gaining knowledge.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.340]   And knowledge without use is the reason why there's so much pride and arrogance and division
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.740]   in the church.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.020]   You know what I found?
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.080]   Whether it is in China, or whether it is in India, or whether even it's here, whenever
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:00.100]   I meet somebody who is absolutely committed to the gospel ministry, even if they are from
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:06.060]   a different denomination, even if they have a different background, there's a camaraderie
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.620]   that we feel the moment we get together.
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:15.500]   And it's a lot easier to be gracious toward different views when we know that at the center
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.620]   of what we're doing, we're committed to.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.620]   Because you don't meet a lot of people who are engaged and crying out for the law.
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.540]   So when you meet somebody who happens to be of another denomination, but yet at the core
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:32.180]   of what they want, we're the same, there's a connection that we feel.
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:37.380]   But you can be in the same denomination, same church, same theology, maybe even the same
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:43.620]   Bible study, but there isn't this desire and this commitment to get the gospel out, and
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.380]   we can be talking about the same thing, reading the same books, but there isn't this fellowship,
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.500]   there isn't this connection.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.860]   Because all it is is regurgitation of information.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.580]   Church planting becomes nothing more than community building.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.180]   We need to plant a church over there because we don't have a community there.
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.300]   We need to plant a church over in LA because we need to have a Christian community over
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.300]   there.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.660]   And all it becomes is just a gathering of people where we're going to just share lives
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.020]   and just do life together.
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.580]   That's all church planting becomes.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:20.980]   See, the primary theme behind all of Genesis to Revelation is a holy God pursuing sinners
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.260]   for his glory.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:29.980]   And so Paul writes the book of Romans, who has the heaviest content, heaviest message
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.340]   of the gospel.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.100]   He says the whole reason why he wrote it is because he's preparing to further the gospel
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.100]   out.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:41.700]   He's just stopping by Rome to spend some time, to gain encouragement, maybe collect some
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.260]   funds, and to move forward.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:49.140]   See, Apostle Paul is a man who encountered Christ, and his life wasn't just changed a
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.900]   little bit.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:57.100]   The gospel changes the trajectory of our lives.
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.740]   If you encounter Christ, and I think this is one of the best illustrations that I've
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:06.160]   heard about this, because in our generation it's kind of confusing.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.080]   How do we determine if somebody is a genuine follower of Christ or not?
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.700]   Because if you grew up in a Christian home, you're supposed to go to church, and it becomes
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.700]   habitual, right?
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.060]   Just like you brush your teeth and go to the bathroom, and there's certain things that
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.300]   you do in the morning, certain things that you do at night, that has become habitual,
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.340]   and you don't even think about it, right?
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.860]   And then you feel weird when you don't do it.
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.660]   And a lot of times coming to church feels like that, that you've gone to church for
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.940]   so long, you don't really give it much thought about what I'm doing on Sunday morning, because
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.300]   you're supposed to do it Sunday, right?
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.980]   And that's one of the dangers of growing up in the church or being in the church for a
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:47.020]   long time, because you don't put any much thought into what you're doing.
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:54.900]   See, when we encounter Christ, and every genuine believer, whether it happened gradually, whether
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:03.300]   it happened in a one-time encounter with Christ, once you encounter Christ, you cannot continue
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.300]   to be on the same path.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:10.820]   And Paul Washer gives a great example of this, how he was talking to an individual and how
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:15.900]   to determine if somebody is a genuine Christian or not, and he says, "If you say you're walking
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:21.820]   down a highway and a semi came, and you said that it came and just hit you, and then the
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.620]   reason why you came to work a little late is because I got hit by a semi, and then what
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.380]   happened is like, oh, I just shrugged it off and then I came to work.
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:36.660]   So if you say that, either you're lying to me or you're a superhuman.
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:41.420]   But an average person cannot be hit by a semi coming down the freeway and then say, "I got
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.940]   hit by it, and then I just shrugged it off, and then I walked into work."
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:53.700]   And he uses that illustration to illustrate a Christian who confesses that he has encountered
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:58.580]   the living God, and just walked away and shrugged off and said, "You know what?
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.580]   I met him.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.700]   I've seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.420]   And then he continued on his path like nothing ever happened.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.920]   It is inconsistent with what we profess.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.580]   It is inconsistent with what we see in Scripture.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:20.980]   Either you have not encountered Christ or something seriously has gone wrong.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:27.660]   The gospel that you and I proclaim, the gospel that Apostle Paul was proclaiming absolutely
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.220]   converted and changed his life.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.220]   Nothing about his past was the same after he met Christ.
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.060]   In Galatians chapter 1, 13 to 16, it says, "For you have heard of my former manner of
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:45.420]   life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and try to destroy
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.660]   it."
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.940]   He wasn't just an average Jew.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.180]   And this was very well known.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.980]   It wasn't just the Jews and a few people.
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.940]   His former way of life was so well known that it says in the book of Acts that as he was
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:05.780]   on trial in front of a Roman governor, he says, "Your learning has made you mad."
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.580]   They already knew about who he was.
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.060]   He was so advanced in Judaism.
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:17.860]   He was basically a celebrity in the Jewish community that even outside they knew of him.
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.500]   He says, "You know about my life."
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.900]   He says, "I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.940]   being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions."
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:33.820]   But in verse 15, he says, "But when God who has set me apart even from my mother's womb
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:39.740]   and called me through his grace was pleased to reveal his son in me so that I might preach
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.980]   him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood."
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:49.140]   And so the following verse, he describes what happened to him, how he was headed toward
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:55.580]   Damascus to persecute, to jail, to beat, maybe even to kill these Christians, to squash this
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:00.700]   gospel, this Jesus that they're proclaiming came back from the dead, this nonsense according
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.740]   to him.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.500]   And he was willing to kill and murder for this.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:10.900]   And all of a sudden, this same man encounters the resurrected Christ and he begins to preach
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.100]   that he was wrong.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:19.140]   He forfeits everything that he had, not just his weekends, not just a portion, not just
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.820]   a tenth.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.940]   He forfeits everything that he had and he began to preach the gospel.
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:32.420]   In fact, his trajectory was so radical, even the other apostles had a difficult time.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.500]   Is this guy tricking us?
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.220]   Maybe he's just pretending because he was coming after to kill us.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.260]   He was the reason why Stephen was martyred.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.140]   And yet now he's standing up and he's preaching the same gospel that he tried to destroy.
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.540]   What happened to this man?
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.660]   It wasn't his will.
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.420]   It wasn't his determination.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.420]   He didn't get discipled.
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.700]   He didn't meet the right people.
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.260]   Somebody didn't sit down with him and argue and convince him.
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:04.300]   He simply encountered the resurrected Christ.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.740]   And he was never the same.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.380]   And so he says in the previous verse that he aspired to preach the gospel where the
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.560]   gospel was not preached.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.740]   And the word for aspired means he was ambitious.
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:17.900]   He was committed.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.300]   That was his aim.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.100]   It was his purpose.
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:26.220]   He loved the honor of preaching the gospel to the very people that he hated.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:34.100]   If he was a real Jew, if he was a Jew among Jew, if he was a celebrity Jew at that time,
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.260]   you had to hate the Gentiles.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:43.940]   You had to hate the Romans in particular because they represented the epitome of blasphemy
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.660]   to a good Jew.
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:50.740]   And yet he's writing this letter to this Gentile church saying that I'm coming to you to get
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.740]   some support.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:57.420]   Now if you fell asleep for 15 years and you knew Paul before he got converted and then
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:02.740]   you're reading this letter, in particular this passage, he's coming to Rome?
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.940]   He's calling them brothers?
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.020]   He's going to get support from them to go even further beyond?
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.100]   What happened to this guy?
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:17.540]   The only answer was he encountered Christ.
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:24.180]   Encountering Christ absolutely changes the trajectory of our lives even more than being
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.660]   hit by a semi.
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.180]   You could see it in Paul's prayer.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.700]   Second Thessalonians 3.1, it says, "Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:36.580]   Lord will spread rapidly and be glorified just as it did also with me."
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.700]   So even his commitment to preach the gospel wasn't casual.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.580]   It wasn't like, you know what, if you just give me another year, I'm going to finish
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.860]   my program and I'm going to get my PhD and then Gamaliel, my disciple, is going to move
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.860]   on so maybe when I have more time I'll do that.
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.500]   He just dropped it.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.980]   Everything that was important to him was no longer important because his whole paradigm,
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.460]   his whole paradigm of what was good and what was bad changed.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.700]   His whole paradigm of life and death completely changed.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.500]   His value system wasn't altered.
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:13.340]   It was radically different after he met Christ.
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:17.340]   So even in the way that he spread the gospel, he said to spread it rapidly because there
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.900]   was a sense of urgency to get the gospel out.
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:25.420]   Now you may look at that and say, "Well, Apostle Paul, maybe he is that type of personality.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.540]   Maybe he's a type A personality.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.980]   He just like a, he's just goal-oriented.
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:30.980]   He's not a people person.
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:35.260]   He's a goal-oriented guy so he needs to get this done."
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:45.060]   You're going to see that it wasn't just Apostle Paul and just logically speaking, and sometimes
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:51.900]   we turn it on on Sunday and turn it off when we're off from Sunday worship.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.180]   On Sunday, gospel is central.
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.140]   In fact, a lot of people complain when we're not gospel-centric.
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:02.380]   "We need to be gospel-centered on Sunday.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.660]   We want the gospel to come out on Sunday."
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.700]   In Bible study, in small group, we need to be gospel-centered.
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:15.380]   But as soon as Bible study is over, it's almost kind of like that belongs there, but now we
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.140]   have to live our normal lives.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.860]   But the gospel that you and I profess and that we sing, that we study, we memorize says
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.840]   that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.360]   And as a result of that, the wrath of God is being revealed against all unrighteousness
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:37.520]   who refuse to give glory to God and give glory to man's creation.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.520]   And as a result of that, when Christ comes in his full glory, he's going to divide the
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:48.540]   sheep and the goats, and then he's going to say to the goats, "You call me Lord, Lord,
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.160]   but your heart is far from me.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.000]   Depart from me to eternal damnation."
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.200]   But to those who say and who believe, say, "We're covered by the blood of Christ and
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:05.840]   we're waiting eagerly to be adopted permanently into his kingdom, to live with him forever."
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.560]   That's the gospel message.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.440]   So everything that you and I experience during this period of life, that we believe and we
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.840]   profess and we sing and we memorize, that it's all going to be burned in fire.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   And it doesn't make sense to profess that, to believe that, to sing that, and to live
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.560]   the rest of our lives trying to build something on this sand.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.760]   It is not Paul who is strange.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.960]   It is not the early church.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.240]   It is not the pastors in India.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.000]   They are not the strange people.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:50.800]   What we have made normal and acceptable in our post-Christian culture is very, very strange.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:57.980]   Because what we profess on Sunday and what we do on Monday, not only is it not similar,
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.200]   it's contradicting.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.240]   Our lives contradict what we profess.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:10.320]   See Apostle Paul is a man where his testimony, what he professed, what he preached, and how
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.400]   he lived was very consistent.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:19.280]   He says in verse 22 that he wanted to come to Rome a long time ago, but he was prevented.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.820]   What prevented him wasn't Satan.
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.200]   What prevented him wasn't time.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.200]   It wasn't money.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:29.840]   He said what prevented him was he wanted to make sure that the gospel was going to reach
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.240]   all the areas where the gospel was not preached.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.200]   So what prevented him was his priority of the gospel.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.520]   Because the gospel already came to Rome.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.260]   And the tradition is that Apostle Peter was the one who brought the gospel to Rome.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:49.160]   So even though he wanted to come, he said he couldn't because it didn't fit his priority
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.160]   of the gospel.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.320]   You know, a lot of us, the way we live is we live our lives and then we try to fit in
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.640]   the gospel in between the cracks.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.520]   We have to get a job, we have to take care of our family, we have to pay our bills, and
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.680]   then so we do all of these things and then we look for cracks in our lives, like this
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.960]   opportunity here, over there.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.320]   And it kind of becomes a peripheral thing.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.720]   Well, we are engaged, kind of.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.760]   The Apostle Paul, the gospel was his life.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.960]   That was his trajectory.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.680]   That was what his priority was.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.840]   And in between the cracks, maybe he might have, you know, I don't know.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.200]   Maybe he, I don't know what he did for fun, I don't know.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.240]   It's not written here, but I'm sure he's a human being, he did something, right?
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:43.360]   But his priority was primarily, first and foremost, this decision making, where he went,
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.560]   what he did, even making tents.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:51.840]   All of it for the purpose, primarily, to get the gospel out.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:58.120]   He spent 12 years just traveling in that area, planting churches.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:05.400]   This is not something that any human being could have done just by determination.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.680]   This is a man who wasn't just committed to the gospel.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.400]   He was obsessed.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.120]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.640]   You know, some of you guys play video games.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.360]   Some of you guys are obsessed, right?
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.760]   And I know you're struggling with it because you're failing school, you know what I mean?
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.520]   You're about to get fired from your job, you know what I mean?
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.160]   Your girlfriend wants to break up with you because you're just so obsessed, it's ruining
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.160]   your life.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.520]   I mean, you're not just playing video games.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.320]   That's all you think about, right?
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.840]   You sit in that same chair so long that your butt starts to hurt.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.240]   That's how obsessed you are.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.240]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.560]   We're not just talking about somebody who's committed.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.040]   We're talking about somebody who just can't think of anything else.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.360]   So if you look at Paul's itinerary in preaching the gospel, he wasn't just committed.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.800]   He was a man who was obsessed.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.640]   And it wasn't just the Apostle Paul.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:10.000]   I actually had a chart of how the gospel spread in the early church, the first maybe about
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.760]   20 years of the church.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.080]   And it shows a pattern of where all the apostles went.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.040]   It wasn't just Apostle Paul.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.280]   And I forgot to send it.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.280]   So I don't have this chart.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.240]   So I'm just going to have to, you know, just tell it to you.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:30.280]   The 40 and over group, we got together for fellowship last night and it got out of hand.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.040]   And we ended up staying till almost midnight yesterday.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.040]   It was crazy.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.040]   That's what happens, right?
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:43.240]   So I got home late so I didn't get time to send it back out.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.760]   There's an inside joke with the gray-haired people.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:53.680]   Anyway, so in that chart, the first 15, 20 years of ministry, it wasn't just Apostle
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   Paul.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.880]   Every one of those disciples went in every direction.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:05.320]   And in those 20 years, they pretty much covered everything that they knew to be a place that
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.140]   needed to be reached with the gospel.
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:17.500]   Those few people reached more people in the first 15 years of their gospel preaching than
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:23.020]   probably the whole Christian community has done in the last 100 years.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.420]   They weren't just committed to the gospel.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.600]   They were obsessed.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.340]   In fact, they were so obsessed with the gospel ministry, they actually had to write letters
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:37.200]   to them and say, "Hey, you guys need to take care of your family."
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.200]   You know?
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.460]   They were so obsessed with the gospel, they had to tell them and say, "Hey, some of you
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.400]   guys are abandoning your jobs waiting for Christ to come.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.640]   You guys need to go back to work."
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.160]   That's how obsessed they were.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.700]   This was not man's doing.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.500]   They didn't just like, "You know what?
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.820]   I think we should make this a priority."
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.860]   They encountered Christ and they were never the same.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:09.420]   See, the gospel ministry that God has called us to, the logical, reasonable response is
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:14.600]   to change everything about our values because it just does.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:19.300]   Not because I'm saying it, because it just does.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.900]   To know that our life and our hope is not here.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.100]   It's not that if you work hard and if you put money away, you're going to have good
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.100]   retirement.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:30.300]   You know, none of that thing is wrong, but our hope is not here.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:35.140]   That if you give yourself to your studies during college, that you're going to graduate
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.500]   and get a good job, that if you invest in your children, that they're going to be raised
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.580]   to be good citizens and good Christians.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.600]   Our hope is not here.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:50.680]   Everything about the gospel tells us that this world is under condemnation and when
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:55.860]   He comes in glory, we will be glorified with Him.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.340]   It is not just Apostle Paul and the early church where God calls us to abandon everything.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:04.420]   That's what, you know, when Jesus says, "Pick up your cross," you know, we kind of like
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.020]   contextualize that.
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:12.340]   Picking up the cross means, you know, that I got to read my Bible in the morning, you
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.340]   know what I mean?
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:17.660]   We contextualize it so it'll be more palatable to what is acceptable to us.
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:23.100]   Literally, what does picking up your cross mean?
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.660]   He was calling them to die.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.660]   He was going to die.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:31.500]   He was calling His disciples to die and then everybody who's going to follow Him to die.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:41.260]   I'm not being extreme because this life that we try to live in this earth, in this world,
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:47.100]   is the source of the condemnation that's coming from God.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:54.260]   So the more you pursue to be alive in this world, the more you pursue your own condemnation.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:28:00.480]   So the very first step, the very first call to the gospel is to die and receive a new
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.900]   life in Christ.
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.600]   He's not just asking us to commit.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:12.300]   He's calling us to be obsessed.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:18.620]   A few years ago, I was helping a friend who was a doctor move and some of his friends
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:23.320]   came and among his friends, there was an oncologist.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.260]   So in between moving, I was having a conversation with him and I said, "It must be really difficult
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:34.500]   because part of his job is to sit with families, mothers or fathers or children and tell them
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.020]   that they have stage four, late stage four cancer and there's nothing we can do.
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.100]   You might have a week to live or a year to live and this is a regular part of his life
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.500]   and it's a man, that must be really hard."
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:50.500]   And he told me, he said, "Yeah, and initially it was really hard, but the only way that
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:55.540]   we can actually get through our jobs is we have to learn to turn it off."
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:02.220]   So he says that him and his other doctors, you know, they will go into a room and tell
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.440]   the patient that you have three weeks to live, devastate the family.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:11.180]   They're in the room crying and they walk out and they go to the break room with the other
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.540]   doctors and they start telling jokes and they just move on.
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:19.180]   And this is what he said to me, he said, "I know that sounds horrible, but the only way
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.860]   that we can do our job is we have to turn it off.
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.420]   We can't bring this home."
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:31.780]   But when it comes to the gospel ministry, when it comes to worshiping God and being
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:40.380]   a follower of Christ, you cannot worship God with your emotions detached.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:46.760]   You cannot be a follower of Christ with your mind separate from your heart.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:52.220]   You cannot be obedient and you cannot have encountered Christ without every part of your
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.560]   being being affected.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:02.660]   You can't share the gospel of eternal salvation and the sacrifice of the Son of God with your
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:07.040]   emotions detached.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:18.500]   It requires people to be consumed, not just on Sunday, not just on designated times, but
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:25.460]   the nature of the gospel requires that the followers pick up their cross and be obsessed
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.860]   with this message.
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:37.900]   Not just be committed, not just be disciplined, not just to give a tenth, but to be obsessed
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:45.220]   where it affects everything that we do and anything less would be hypocrisy.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:51.640]   In Isaiah chapter 40 verse 31, God says, "Yet those who wait for the Lord will gain new
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.640]   strength.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.480]   They will mount up with wings like eagles.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.460]   They will run and not get weary.
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.240]   They will walk and not become weary."
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:03.700]   I can't read this passage without thinking about Apostle Paul and the early disciples
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.760]   because that's exactly what they did.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.580]   How could they have physically done what they have done?
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:15.600]   How could they have just even covered that space with all the headache?
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.340]   They weren't doing it by their own strength.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.340]   God promised them.
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.340]   They will wait upon the Lord.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:23.720]   A lot of times we use this verse to kind of find encouragement like when we're tired from
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.720]   work.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.120]   "They will wait upon the Lord.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.400]   They will renew my strength."
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.680]   Maybe you've eaten like a box of Cheetos and you're just tired.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:36.200]   "Lord, I need you, Lord.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:41.320]   I need to mount up on wings of eagles because we've been lazy."
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.040]   Like we use this verse to apply it to anything that we need strength for.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.880]   What is he talking about wait upon the Lord?
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.440]   Wait to do what?
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.200]   What do we need strength for?
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.920]   So that we can get to work?
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.640]   So that we wouldn't be tired at the end of the day?
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.180]   Is that what he's talking about?
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.720]   Why would we need his strength?
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.120]   To do his will.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.700]   To carry out the gospel message.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.040]   To make disciples.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.480]   To honor Christ.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.720]   To take the gospel where the gospel hasn't gone.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.720]   And when we are discouraged, when we are wearied, when we're physically tired, when we are sick
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:26.400]   in the context of obedience to God, those who wait upon the Lord will renew their strength.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.380]   They will ride upon the wings of eagles that she said God promises to strengthen us.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.520]   And that's exactly what we see among the apostles.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.680]   I mean, read the book of Acts.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.940]   As they're running for their lives, they're spreading the gospel, these people were not
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.940]   just committed.
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.380]   They were obsessed.
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.660]   Because they encountered the living Christ and they were never the same.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:54.700]   Even in the way that Paul prays in Ephesians 6, 19 to 20, "And pray on my behalf that utterance
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.820]   may be given to me in the opening of my mouth to make known the boldness of the mystery
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:02.980]   of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in chains.
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.020]   That in proclaiming it, I may speak boldly as I ought to speak."
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:13.940]   He said, even as he is in chains, even as he is bound, his primary prayer is not, "Pray
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.660]   for me so that I can get out."
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.820]   That's not his prayer.
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:18.820]   It's uncomfortable.
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.020]   I mean, it's not like jail today, right?
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.180]   Not that any jail is comfortable.
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:28.500]   You know, but we're talking about in a period when he's locked up and chained to a Roman
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.500]   guard and, you know, it's probably freezing.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.300]   It's very uncomfortable.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:38.100]   I mean, as he is in that situation, he's saying, "Pray that I can be bold in preaching the
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.100]   gospel."
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.220]   He has a one-track mind.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:46.500]   Philippians chapter 1, 12 to 14, "Now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstance,"
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:51.060]   talking about him being in chains, "have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel,
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:55.260]   so that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:59.620]   predatory guard and to everyone else, and that most of the brethren trusting in the
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:05.260]   Lord because of my imprisonment have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear."
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:11.180]   He didn't evaluate what was good and what was bad based upon how comfortable he is.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:16.940]   How often do we thank God when things go well according to the standard of this world?
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:21.460]   When we get promoted, "Oh, God answered my prayers.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.460]   Thank God."
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:27.360]   Again, we're not saying that that's wrong, but consider how much of our prayer, how much
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.580]   of our paradigm mimics what the world sees.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:39.500]   When we get a job, when we're sick and we become healthy, Paul didn't evaluate good
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:47.380]   and bad, right and wrong, based upon how comfortable he was, how full his belly was, how good he
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:52.180]   was taking it, how firm his future was.
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:54.780]   It was all based upon the gospel.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:35:00.860]   It's because of his imprisonment, people are being bold in preaching the gospel.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.000]   So this is good.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.820]   Even more than that, later on he says he's praying so that whether by life or by death,
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.220]   that he would have sufficient courage to exalt Christ.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:18.500]   So even if he does, if dying means that the gospel will be glorified, then death is what
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.220]   he embraces.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.540]   This is an obsessed man.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:29.460]   First Corinthians 16, 8 and 9, "But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost for a wide
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:34.140]   door for effective service has opened to me and there are many adversaries."
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.140]   Do you notice that?
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:42.180]   Paul says, "I can't come right now in Corinthians because a wide door has been opened for me
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.180]   for the gospel."
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:47.740]   But he qualifies that by saying, "But there are adversaries, many adversaries."
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.820]   Because the way that you and I think is if there's many adversaries, the door's not
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.620]   open.
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:58.980]   If I commit to this and my children are not going to be taken care of, I'm waiting for
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.140]   the door to open.
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:09.180]   I'm waiting for my needs to be met, my bills to be paid, and my family to be healthy.
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:13.940]   Until then, the door's not open because we immediately think, "God shut that door.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:16.740]   If I'm not comfortable, that means there's no opportunity for me."
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:23.140]   If they're not going to like it, if I have to risk my health, God didn't open the door.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.860]   Paul says it's been wide open and there are adversaries there.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.620]   He didn't evaluate what was good and what was bad based upon how comfortable he is in
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.300]   the context of preaching the gospel.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:40.420]   All he saw was an opportunity to glorify Christ.
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.100]   And it affected directly.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:49.620]   And again, not only did it affect his time, if you look at the early church, what he says
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.220]   here is the primary reason why he was coming was for the purpose of help.
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.340]   And when he says help, he's talking about cash.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:02.900]   You may look at that and say, "Well, I'm going to go there and rest and let me rest in your
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:03.900]   house."
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.680]   And all of that is true, but what did he need to get to Spain?
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:14.720]   He recruits some people and some cold hard cash.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.060]   Whenever we talk about money in the church, people get nervous.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:21.980]   It's like, "Oh, he's going to ask for more money."
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:22.980]   Yes.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:29.340]   It's a nervous laugh.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.340]   I understand it.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:35.960]   I get it because the church has abused finances and a lot of people have distrust toward the
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:40.860]   church with money, and as a result of that, the church is kind of like, "Oh, we're not.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.860]   We're pure.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.420]   We're not about money, so you don't have to give offering and all this stuff because we're
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.040]   pure."
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.100]   If you look at Jesus' teaching, he talks more about money than any other subject when it
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.340]   comes to the kingdom of God.
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:57.760]   And the reason why is because that's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.300]   You can talk about lordship all you want.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.420]   You can talk about commitment all you want.
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:06.020]   You can tell where your heart is by what?
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:10.020]   By where your treasure is.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.200]   That's in the Bible.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.300]   It's in the Bible.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:18.140]   So Jesus talks about money more than any other subject because that's where the rubber meets
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.220]   the road.
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:23.780]   You can't have money being spent for your flesh and then say, "My spirit is for the
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.300]   Lord."
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.300]   He talked about money more than any other subject.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:33.980]   He taught 38 parables, and out of the 38, 16 of them is about right attitude toward
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:37.180]   money.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:44.540]   The gospels, the four gospels, one in 10 verses deal with the subject of money.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:53.780]   The Bible has 500 verses on prayer, 500 verses on faith, and over 2,000 verses about money.
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:39:00.660]   When we talk about the Old Testament sacrifices, the greater the sin, whether it's a high
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:06.180]   priest or a priest or lay people or the congregation, they have different values.
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:12.820]   And you have to give a bowl offering without defect for a greater sin.
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:18.140]   Now to us, we're not farmers, so we think of that, we just think of bowl, we think of,
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.180]   we don't know how much these things cost.
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:25.300]   I found out how much it cost in Kenya because Beloved, I remember they were trying to buy
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.300]   a cow.
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.300]   I was like, "Oh, okay, learned something new."
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.460]   Absolutely useless information for me, but I knew that in Kenya you can buy a cow for
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.780]   about a thousand bucks.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:42.740]   So if you are a farmer and your primary way of distinguishing wealth wasn't a bank account,
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:48.220]   wasn't dollars or whatever it is that you use for currency, it was your livestock and
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:52.660]   you came to offering and God said in order to be reconciled to God that you need to give
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:58.180]   a bowl offering to a Jew, that's a thousand dollars.
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:05.220]   If you gave a bowl with defect, that would be $700 because it wouldn't be worth as much.
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:09.460]   If it was a bowl that happened to be a female, it wasn't, at least at that time, wasn't worth
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:12.840]   as much, then it would be worth $600.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.980]   So they had different values.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:19.100]   So when it talks about all these different sacrifices, a Jew of that time is thinking
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.700]   value of money.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:25.420]   And that's why he gives provision for poorer people to be able to give pigeons and different
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:28.260]   gifts because they didn't have the money.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:34.820]   So even Leviticus, you didn't know it, but we're studying about money because in the
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:38.380]   end that's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.580]   Now again, I'm not saying that therefore you need to empty your bank account and give it
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.820]   to the gospel ministry.
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:46.380]   God doesn't say that all rich people should be poor.
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.380]   God doesn't say that.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.860]   There are plenty of examples of rich people in the New Testament.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:54.860]   There's examples in the book of James about businessmen who are trying to make money going
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.240]   from city to city and say, "Don't be arrogant saying that I'm going to do this, but only
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.780]   say if the Lord wills."
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:06.940]   So he doesn't call Christianity, he doesn't call the church to be communist.
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.420]   That's not what he is saying.
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:15.020]   It is the love of money that is the root of all kinds of evil.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.460]   It is the root of coveting.
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.300]   It is the root of jealousy.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.860]   It is the root of lying.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:24.540]   It is the root of slander, thievery.
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:30.480]   See, but when the early church encountered Christ, you could see it in the way that they
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.220]   saw money.
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:37.460]   In Acts chapter 2, 43 to 45, everyone kept feeling a sense of awe and many wonder signs
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:42.220]   were taking place throughout through the apostles and all those who had believed were together
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.420]   and had all things in common.
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:48.980]   And they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.240]   and anyone might have need.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.840]   You notice here that God didn't choose generous people and save them and then so therefore
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.340]   they were generous.
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.560]   He saved sinners who were living selfishly and they became generous because the gospel
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.340]   changed their paradigm.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:12.180]   Their value system completely got overturned and money didn't have the same value that
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.420]   it had.
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:17.540]   So some people had more, some people had less, but the way that they viewed it radically
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:22.420]   changed and they began to use it for the gospel ministry.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:29.500]   You know what's really interesting to me is Apostle Paul writes one of the harshest letters
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.300]   to the Corinthian church.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:40.140]   So if you've ever studied the Corinthians, 15 chapters of Paul and he starts out nice.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:44.420]   You know, I thank God for you, you know, God's doing great work and I thank God for you.
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:50.100]   So he said maybe about six, seven verses and then he's like, and then the next 15 chapters,
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.380]   what is wrong with you?
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.340]   Like that's kind of like the tone.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.660]   I just summarized like what he says in 15 chapters, right?
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:01.180]   So you guys are divided, you guys are worldly, do you not know that you're a temple of God
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.380]   and the spirit of God dwells in you?
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.620]   Whoever destroys the church, God will destroy him.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.500]   Like even the communion that you have is not communion before God.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.680]   You know, the rich people are making the poor people and they're coming starving.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.900]   This is not honoring to God at all.
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:18.380]   Even in the way that you give worship that you say, oh, I have a gift of prophecy or
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.380]   I have a gift of tongues and it's creating all kinds of chaos in the church.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:28.740]   So 15 chapters of rebuking them and then right as he is done rebuking them, he concludes
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:34.060]   the letter this way, 1 Corinthians 16, 1 and 2, "Now concerning the collection of the
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:39.220]   saints as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:44.260]   On the first day of every week, each one of you is to put aside and save as he may prosper
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.620]   so that no collection be made when I come."
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:55.340]   I was like, wow, this guy, he spent 15 chapters rebuking them and then his conclusion is I'm
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:01.940]   going to collect some money when I come, get ready, right?
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:06.500]   This guy would not have been a good health and wealth gospel preacher because if you're
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:13.780]   trying to collect money, right, you don't rebuke them for 15 chapters.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:17.020]   You talk about how nice they are.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.100]   You know, you guys are doing such a great job and I know you got some problems.
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:23.860]   You guys are divided a little bit, but you know, you need to work on that.
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:28.500]   You got so gracious, you know, and you guys are really good people.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:33.380]   I love you people and I need to collect some offering.
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.460]   Like that's what he should be doing.
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.660]   You don't spend 11 chapters rebuking them, how the judgment of God is going to come upon
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.860]   them and then after he's done, get your money ready.
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.500]   I'm coming, right?
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:51.580]   It's just this guy's not good at this and the only reason why Apostle Paul could be
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:45:01.220]   so bold is because this was a man who was absolutely had clear conscience before God.
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.220]   Money was not dirty.
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:06.500]   Money was a part of the gospel ministry.
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:10.700]   We made it dirty because we didn't handle it correctly.
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:16.620]   But when we talk about lordship, when we talk about sacrifice, when we talk about commitment,
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.180]   like where does that show?
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:26.500]   The way you spend your time, the way you spend your money, how much of our finances are committed
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:31.700]   to our comfort versus the gospel ministry.
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:37.980]   Let me for the sake of time wrap up.
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:46.740]   There are people in the, I think I prayed or I told you that I've been praying, Lord,
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:51.500]   what should we do with the resources that you've given us as a church?
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:46:00.780]   Whether it's finances or manpower and it seems pretty clear to me that our primary commitment
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:05.420]   isn't to build a nicer church, to have better programs for our children and all of these
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:10.020]   things are good things and hopefully that we can deal with it as it comes.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:16.460]   But the primary calling of the church is one to worship God in spirit and in truth, right?
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:23.020]   To equip the saints with the living word of God, to build up the body of Christ through
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:29.000]   accountability and love, ultimately for the fourth vision, to spread the gospel locally
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.260]   and globally.
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:39.900]   But if we're not committed to the fourth vision, all three other vision unravels.
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:47.100]   Because if all our worship means is to sing loud on Sunday, if all our Bible study means
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:52.180]   to gain more information, if all we're doing in the church is to build a better community
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:57.940]   where people like each other, then all of it is for nothing.
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:05.340]   My prayer is that God would raise up some of us, that we would have the courage to pack
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:12.260]   up our bags and go places for the purpose of the gospel.
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:17.700]   But I also know that majority of us that that is not going to be the case.
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.780]   So some of us will go.
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.140]   Most of us will stay.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:28.940]   And if we stay, we need to stay purposefully.
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:32.780]   That we don't differentiate people from those who go, "Oh, thank God God is going."
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:36.460]   Those people with courage, and we're blessed by their testimony, and we encourage you from
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:40.580]   a distance, and we give a little finances to say that we're participating in your work,
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:45.340]   that we don't just look at them and say, "Thank God that's not us."
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:50.940]   That if they go, pray for them, support them, encourage them.
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:59.980]   And if we stay, stay purposefully, committed equally to spread the gospel, to make sure
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:05.340]   that this period of time that God has given us, whether it is 10 years, 1 year, or 50
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:13.040]   years, that the time that God has given us, that we would use it to spread His glory.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.140]   That at the end of our life, that we don't look at a pile of cash that we've amassed
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:21.660]   and say, "Well, I've done good."
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.940]   That at the end of our lives, on our deathbed, that we would look at our lives and say, "It
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:26.940]   was well spent."
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:34.900]   And that we can enter into eternity with a clear conscience.
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.980]   Believe.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.260]   Believe that Christ is our greatest treasure.
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.820]   Believe that Jesus is the true living water.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:50.160]   Believe that life is in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:59.040]   Believe that Jesus is, and He is the rewarder of those who diligently seek Him, then live
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.240]   accordingly.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:08.200]   Let's pray.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:13.480]   As our worship team comes up and takes some time to lead us, let's take some time to pray.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:18.880]   Think of very specific people that God has placed in your life to be a witness to.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.680]   Those of you who are college students coming back to campus, and I know you have a lot
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:26.600]   of things that you may be looking forward to, there's nothing more important that you
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:33.720]   will do during college than to be a light to the non-Christians around you.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:38.920]   That opportunity doesn't come after you graduate.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   Use that opportunity.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.080]   Redeem it for your glory.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.040]   So commit this year.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:48.080]   Commit your freshman year, commit your junior, sophomore, senior year to be a light to the
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.640]   non-Christians who are around you.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.200]   They're coming from all over the world.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:56.520]   I've met people from China on campus who have never heard the gospel.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.520]   We didn't have to go there.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.200]   They came here.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.960]   Be a light.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:06.660]   Some of you guys are in industries where it's very difficult to find Christians.
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:10.200]   You might be the only Christian that you know at your work.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.640]   Pray.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.640]   Pray for courage.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.240]   Pray for boldness.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.360]   Pray to be intentional.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.320]   You don't have to be weird, right?
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:23.600]   You don't have to be abrupt, but first pray.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.360]   Pray for God to open your eyes to see the need.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:31.320]   Pray for God to soften your heart to be broken for them, and pray for opportunities that
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.760]   you can have conversation.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:33.760]   Pray.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:39.840]   Some of you guys come from homes where you're the only Christian, or there's very few Christians
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:41.480]   in your home.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.800]   Be intentional.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.800]   Pray for them.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:50.880]   Pray that the next family time that you have, that God would open doors so you can share
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.000]   the gospel with them.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:58.200]   Every single one of us has somebody, maybe one, maybe groups of people, where they're
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:02.480]   waiting for you to open your mouth and be a light.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.720]   So let's take some time to pray.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.400]   Pray that God will give us the courage, God will give us the strength, that God would
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:11.100]   renew us so that we can be the light that he's called us to be.
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.860]   So let's take some time to pray for that as our worship team leads us.
