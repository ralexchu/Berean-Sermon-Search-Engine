[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Now, for baptism, we don't have a huge banquet, we don't have coordinators, we don't have
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:16.480]   flowers and things like that, but this is on a scale of most grandiose importance, amen?
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.440]   Because spiritually, it reflects such an important truth in our lives, that the people being
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.800]   baptized today are expressing and recognizing their faith.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.280]   That initially by faith, they heard and accepted and believed the truth that they are in absolute
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.720]   need, that they are by definition sinners and destined for wrath.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.840]   And upon that, they also believe that their only way of rescue, their only way of salvation
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.440]   is Christ.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.560]   And they're going to express today that they have placed such trust on our Lord and Savior
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.120]   Jesus.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.680]   And therefore, this baptism ceremony is reflective and iconic of the grand salvation that has
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.640]   been the plan of God for the ages.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.680]   Now, as we think about this salvation, this salvation that we have, the scripture uses
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.280]   so many different categories, definition, and emphasis.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.040]   For example, please take a moment to listen to these various terms.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.800]   And I'm going to do a this side versus that side, a comparison, because this is the way
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.000]   that the scriptures describe salvation.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.720]   You go from a state of completely being lost to now being found as we just sung.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.960]   You go from a state of being absolutely blind in darkness to having light shine upon you
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.260]   and you being able to see.
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.920]   You go from a position where you are unrighteous, evil, sinful, and guilty to a position of
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.680]   holiness, righteousness, justified.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.300]   You go from worthless to redeemed, having eternal value in Christ.
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.600]   You go from being abandoned as an orphan to being a child of God.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.200]   You go from being bound as a slave to sin to freedom in Christ.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.080]   You go from absolute deadness to new life in the Savior.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.840]   You go from hell to heaven.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.700]   Now, these are just some of the vast array of categories and definitions of what salvation
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.460]   is for us.
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.800]   So when we say that this ceremony depicts and pictures for us salvation, we're saying
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.440]   a lot, right?
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.720]   We're saying a lot.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.980]   Now as I mentioned to you those things, I would like to focus your attention.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.200]   As we take a moment to think about what salvation is, what are we being saved from, I would
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   like to highlight an important truth.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.040]   And the truth is this, whether you are a Christian or not, the feeling of being lost is there,
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.360]   right?
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.840]   Many people, especially in our day, have a sense of feeling of being lost, a sense of
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.440]   a personal identity, purpose, meaning, value.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.520]   These are things that people search for even if they are not Christian, religious, or affiliated
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.900]   with any kind of spirituality.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.600]   And that's interesting.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   But what's more, the other categories that I presented to you about blindness, and then
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.280]   moral depravity, unrighteousness, wickedness in the heart, guilt, and shame, I actually
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.080]   believe these are also things that people experience.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.240]   What's more, people across the board, if we took a survey and asked, "Have you ever felt
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.280]   abandoned, distant, unconnected relationally?"
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.960]   I have a feeling and sentiment that many people would feel that as well.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.360]   If we ask people, "Do you feel sometimes bound, like you don't have the power to do what you
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.520]   would like, that you don't have the restraint to stop yourself from doing the things you
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.640]   hate, doing the things you know are self-destructive and not good for you?"
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.120]   You talk to individuals who have addictions, you have talked to individuals who have patterns
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.600]   and habits of life that they cannot escape from.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.200]   And we ask them, "Do you ever feel bound?"
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.620]   I'm pretty sure they'll say, "I've had those feelings many times."
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.240]   And then, this is a sad state of affairs.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.560]   We are in America, the most privileged and vastly wealthy, I guess you can even say not
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.360]   just in current time, but across history, we're one of the most privileged nations across
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.240]   time.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.200]   And yet, when you take a look at the statistic of people who feel dead and who feel the temptation
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.400]   to even take their own life, I mean, it's shocking and frightening.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.320]   Now I'm talking a lot about feelings right now.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.720]   Feelings of this one side I depicted for you.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.720]   The feelings of the stuff that we want to be saved from.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.760]   And what I'm saying, it is almost a universal experience.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.640]   It is a feeling that we all share.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.920]   And then, we ask the question, "So of those things, what's the worst?"
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.520]   Of those things, what is our biggest problem?
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.520]   I believe people who are trying to escape all these feelings of lostness, blindness,
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.520]   guilt and shame, worthless, being abandoned, relationally isolated, being bound, enslaved
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.480]   and feeling dead, what they don't recognize is that their greatest plight is not those
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.920]   things.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.520]   What they need rescue from, what they need deliverance, what they need salvation from
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.320]   is not that.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.680]   Why?
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:53.800]   Because all those things are the fruit of God not being in your life.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.500]   Not having God is the scariest thing in life.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.560]   The most at-risk scenario and circumstance you can find yourself in is being apart and
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.480]   far from God who is good.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.040]   Take a moment to think about this.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.880]   Godlessness is your greatest plight.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.560]   Now, as I speak of this, for those of you who are joining us today and you are not Christian,
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.880]   and perhaps you've heard elements of Christianity being taught, that people want you to stop
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.800]   your habits of sin, you know, the standard stuff, smoking, drinking, partying, whatever
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   it may be.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.080]   I am trying to make a different case for you today.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.080]   It is not that I want you to escape from the vices of normal human behavior.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.720]   It is that actually we want to make sure that you understand that what you need salvation
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:56.960]   from is the kind of darkness where the light and life of God is non-existent.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.680]   This is what the individuals who are sharing today are going to speak about.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.400]   When they had their eyes open to see that the darkness in their life is not having a
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.720]   moment of, "Oh my goodness, what am I doing?"
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.800]   The darkness in their life is not just an absence of meaning.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:21.680]   The darkness in their life is when they realize God is far because they are far from the Lord.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.680]   You know what Scripture says in Ephesians chapter 2 verses 11 through 13?
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.400]   It says this, "Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh who are called
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.480]   uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision which is performed in the flesh by human hands,"
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.520]   remember this, here's the important part, "that you are at that time separated from
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:46.440]   Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenant of promise,
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:52.240]   having no hope without a God in the world."
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.840]   This is the most pitiful circumstance.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.200]   This is what we need to escape.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.560]   The contrast is in verse 13, it says, "But now in Christ Jesus you who were formerly
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.840]   far off have been brought near."
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.760]   Do you hear that?
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.480]   The greatest plight of mankind is your separation, your exclusion, and you being a stranger to
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:20.240]   God Almighty and you having none, none of the promises, none of the goodness that I
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.480]   talked about earlier, whether it be being found, having light, having holiness, redeem,
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.920]   being a child of freedom.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:32.240]   All those things are a fruit of God being in your life.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:38.160]   But the sad state of affairs is our biggest problem then is not having God.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.600]   And see, you realize then that earlier when I did this and I did this, although my arms
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:50.340]   are this far, the spiritual reality is I cannot even picture for you with my arms how wide
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.840]   and far this chasm is, right?
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.760]   I can't show you physically how far it is to be without God and to be with God.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.880]   And this divide is so huge.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.360]   Scripture goes at length and length to try to make you understand.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.080]   And if anybody in your life tried to make it smaller by telling you, "It's okay, all
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.720]   you have to do is come to church.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.460]   It's okay, all you have to do is read some books.
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.680]   It's okay, all you have to do is copy me," they're doing you a huge disfavor.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.680]   Why?
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.920]   Because that's not reality.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.120]   Because that's not the truth.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.680]   When we are separated from God, the chasm is enormous.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.480]   And the reason why I want to make this a case for you is because I find that there is an
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.440]   error amongst individuals that we all share.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.120]   Just as we share in the experience of the depravity of man, feeling, I'm going to go
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.320]   down it again, feeling lost, feeling blind, feeling isolated, rejected, feeling sinful
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.160]   and shameful, feeling like we're orphans, feeling like we're slaved, feeling like we're
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.560]   dead, and feeling like we're going to be judged for it.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.600]   If we all share in that experience, you know what happens next?
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.720]   We also share in a common practice trying to get out of it.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.640]   I'm going to repeat that.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:18.720]   If we all share in the experience of this arena of depravity and darkness, then you're
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.840]   going to find that we all also have a very similar pattern of trying to get out, trying
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.160]   to find a solution for that.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.600]   And what we find are people who are trying their best to say, "All I need to do is find
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.600]   meaning.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.360]   All I need to do is find a good leader.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.360]   All I need to do is get educated.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:41.080]   All I need to do is find some model that I can follow, find some kind of superstructure
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.600]   that can make me feel safe."
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.360]   But that is deception and falsehood.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.640]   That is not seeing the reality.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:57.520]   And what's more, that is an absolutely pitiful state, a great tragedy, if you will, because
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:04.280]   what that would amount to is an individual who is desperately in need, desperately hungry,
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:11.720]   desperately malnourished, dehydrated, thirsty, but all they're doing is chewing on air.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.560]   Think about this for a moment.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:19.880]   To assess the problem in an incorrect fashion is like an individual going to the doctors,
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.440]   and the doctor is starting to assess various symptoms.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.560]   "Oh, goodness, your skin.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.560]   It's all decaying.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.520]   It has mold and fungus on your body.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.960]   Oh, my goodness, your eyes.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.480]   Your eyes are horrible and your eyesight is gone.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.160]   Dear goodness, inside your liver are maggots.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.440]   Where is your voice?
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.880]   How come you don't have a voice?"
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.960]   To look at all these symptoms and realize there's decay, there's death, and then to
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.240]   only realize, "You know what the problem is?
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.640]   You're a zombie.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.200]   You're as good as dead."
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:00.480]   What good is it for a zombie to go into the hospital to get diagnosed for problems?
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.560]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:12.480]   Well, oftentimes there is an error by which we misdiagnose how far that chasm is.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.800]   Our greatest plight, as my case to you today, is that we have no God.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:24.760]   To be apart from the Lord is to have no life, and therefore the zombie analogy is appropriate.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.920]   Scripture says in John 1, verses 1 through 4, that "In the beginning was the Word, and
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.400]   the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.080]   He was in the beginning with God.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.400]   All things came into being through him, and apart from him nothing came into being that
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.520]   has came into being."
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:46.400]   Verse 4, "But in him was life, and the life was the light of men."
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.280]   To be apart from Christ is to be a zombie.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.000]   You're walking, but you are dead.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:01.160]   Now I say this because what God does for us is he enables us to see this plight.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.320]   And the reason why I bring this up is because I had the sweet opportunity to read all of
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.640]   their testimonies, and you are going to see this pattern where God has opened their eyes
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.960]   and given them the mercy to see, "I have this need."
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.560]   Some of them quickly saw as they were young.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.240]   Some of them had to learn the hard way.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.800]   They had to try, he's like, "Amen."
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.920]   They had to learn the hard way.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.520]   They saw their depravity, they saw the darkness, and what they did was decided, "Well, then
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.220]   I've got to do something."
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.800]   What they did was they put forth more of their effort.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.240]   What they did is they tried to put a band-aid on that decay.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.840]   What they did is try to pick out the maggots.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.640]   What they did is try, try to follow at least someone else's example for righteousness in
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:52.360]   their lives, only to realize, "I'm still chewing air."
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.760]   So here is my encouragement and challenge to you as I conclude this sermon and give
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.560]   it over to them.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.280]   Don't make that error.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:05.880]   If you realize you are in the kingdom of darkness, but there is a kingdom of light, you cannot
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:12.560]   demand that this king come over here and make your kingdom better.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.040]   You cannot demand, "Let me still be king over this darkness," but can you make this kingdom
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:23.080]   any better by adding to it a little bit more light, by adding to it a little bit more purpose,
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.460]   by adding to it a little bit more value?
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.280]   That cannot be done.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.640]   What does the gospel, what does it say?
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:36.400]   He says, "Let this completely, completely be broken."
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:42.260]   The individual who will come to Christ is going to say, "Lord, this kingdom is shot,
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.680]   and I am so broken I will lay down my crown.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.080]   I will no longer be king over this dark, dark place.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.200]   I'm not going to try to enter your kingdom of light still as a king.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.960]   I'm going to lay this down and tell you, 'Lord, I cannot improve this.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.160]   There's nothing to be salvaged.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.160]   It is condemned.'"
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.720]   And so the scripture says that when you put faith in Christ, you're going to then join
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:12.000]   with him in his death, that your old man is completely done away.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.240]   And that flesh that so bounded us is going to be condemned by Christ.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:22.080]   Only so that what you're going to have is not simply improved, is not going to be simply
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:28.000]   repaired, but you're going to have absolute perfect value, perfect identity, perfect meaning
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.760]   because your life is found in the resurrected life of Christ.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.760]   Amen?
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.480]   That is the Christian gospel.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:41.600]   You are not going from kind of bad to kind of good.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.960]   You're going to go from complete darkness to perfection in Christ.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.240]   And that is the hope that they have, and that's the hope that they're going to share.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.640]   Let's take a moment to pray and invite our first individual to come up and give their
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.680]   testimony.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:05.040]   Lord God, we want to thank you so much that in your grace and in your mercies, you give
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.720]   to us revelation.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.440]   You speak to us.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.960]   You open our eyes and you convict our hearts.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.640]   Thank you so much for that God.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.560]   And we recognize Lord that that is your love and grace to us.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.080]   Thank you so much Lord for the individuals here who are going to give their testimony.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.660]   God, what we see is just an overflow of your mercies upon them.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:32.240]   And I pray that with great gratitude in their heart, you will empower them to share of the
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.200]   work you have done in their lives.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.160]   And for all of us here gathered, would you work in our heart that as we hear, we will
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.640]   unite with them in faith, we will sympathize with them and be all the more edified and
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.640]   refreshed.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.840]   We thank you it's in Christ name we pray.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.840]   Amen.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.120]   So we have seven individuals who are going to be baptized today and they're going to
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.200]   come up now and give their testimony.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.600]   Our first sister to share is Eunice.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   Let's give her a warm welcome.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600]   Hi, my name is Eunice and I attend UCI and I'll just start on my testimony.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   When I was younger, I went to a Christian school and I wasn't the brightest kid, but
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   I made my way with the Garden of Eden.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.600]   And I was a little bit scared of the church because I was a little bit scared of the church.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.600]   But I was a little bit scared of the church.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.600]   And I was a little bit scared of the church.
