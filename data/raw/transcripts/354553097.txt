[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   We're gonna begin, let's, let me pray for us and then we'll start.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.560]   My goal is to get you out of here while it's still two something.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.560]   Okay, that's a good goal?
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.000]   Okay, hopefully before the big hand hits the nine, but we'll see, all right?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.240]   Let me pray and then we'll begin.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.880]   Lord, we thank you for just putting us together, not just in our small family units, but collectively
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.040]   at a church together where we can sharpen each other, where we can really grow together.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.040]   And it does take a village and we thank you for putting us together in this village so
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.360]   that we can really help each other raise our children up in the fear of the Lord.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.620]   We pray for your help today, that this would be a smooth meeting, that all the parents
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:00.400]   would really be at peace knowing that as a church we really do wanna see their kids grow
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.160]   in their faith and to bring you glory and honor in their lives.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.200]   And that as a church, education department, that we're working alongside them to, just
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.680]   to nurture and to, just to feed.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.920]   So we thank you and pray these things in Jesus' name.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.320]   So this is our first ever all education department, I guess, parents meeting.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:32.240]   We're gonna keep doing it this way as we get bigger.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.280]   Hold up real quick.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.080]   Okay, so this is just a little bit of a structure, just to show you what things look like.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.340]   Our family ministry, it's kind of broken up into the family ministry and the SO department.
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.280]   SO means students of the word.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.880]   I came up with that in 2002 and then I brought it to Berean in 2005 and then I came back
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.340]   and it's still stuck.
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.300]   So it has since evolved to seeds, vines, sprouts, saplings, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.640]   But students of the word is the moniker and the vine is our youth ministry.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.920]   We've since changed it to seventh to 12th.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.400]   So our sixth graders are actually staying behind.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.480]   So seventh to 12th.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.760]   Sprouts is kindergarten to sixth.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.420]   Seeds is one to four years old by September.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.360]   And then included in this, we have our awana and events and child safety.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.680]   So just so that there's a clarity in your heads as to what this is.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.120]   And I feel like the SO is appropriate because we really don't know how many of our kids
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.200]   in the education department really have a relationship with Christ.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.000]   And that is not something that is easy to discern at this age.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.400]   But most people who come to faith, come to faith before they hit 14.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.360]   So we are praying alongside you and investing alongside you that in God's time fruit will
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.360]   be born.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.000]   So this is a little bit of the structure.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.160]   These are all our teachers.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.280]   We have 30.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.080]   And the ones in the red are the ones who are serving with us on staff for the first time.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.720]   So the vine is a youth.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.900]   Sprouts is our Sunday school children's ministry.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.360]   And seeds is our nursery.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.760]   Okay.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.160]   Now what we've decided with this change with Pastor Mark, switch me and Pastor Mark switch
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.680]   in our BAM and youth hats.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.480]   We brought all the education department under my care.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.360]   And we have since decided to do our own Bible study.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.160]   And we're going to be doing that in the Philippines on Tuesday nights.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.680]   And so just sharing with you what our Bible study looks like.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.800]   We have praise.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.120]   We have inductive Bible study discussion.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.720]   And then we have a teaching section.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.520]   And normally if you guys are in your home groups or here on Wednesday, after the teaching
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.640]   session you break up into application.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.480]   With our teachers, everyone breaks up into departments.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.900]   And because we're also studying Philippians with your kids, it gives our teachers to contextualize
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.080]   it and make it the lessons age appropriate.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.440]   Obviously with seeds, it's hard to do any kind of inductive anything.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.880]   So we're keeping the seeds as it's been going.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.080]   And it's, we don't need to touch the curriculum per se for the seeds.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.960]   So but with every other group from kindergarten all the way up to seniors in high school and
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.540]   even the college ministry, we're all on Philippians.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.380]   And so this is also added motivation for you guys to review with your children.
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.380]   So that's what we're doing.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.360]   And every Sunday morning, our teachers are all going to get together in the Sprouts room
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.360]   and pray.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.080]   Pray for your service.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.720]   Pray for our kids.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.760]   And if there are any needs that come up, we will pray together for those children and
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.760]   their families.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760]   Okay?
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.920]   So please, do not hesitate to shoot prayer requests to us.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.040]   We will pray for them in the event that you're okay with it being private or public.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.320]   So the Philippians curriculum for the youth group and the elementary, the vine and the
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.320]   sprouts, everyone's going to get a worksheet sent home.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   Okay?
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.480]   And then the worksheet is going to usually be about four pages, including discussion
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:37.000]   questions and including study notes and including memory verse.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Okay?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.040]   Now, the worksheets are tailored toward high school and junior high kids.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.160]   So if your first grader gets a worksheet that's made for high school, junior high kids, obviously
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.800]   you're not going to be happy about it.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.680]   But the reason we're doing that is because I can't make 12 sets of worksheets.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.640]   I just make one for the youth.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.720]   And as a parent, you get to see it and then work through that with your child.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.320]   And so we're always going to be about two, three weeks behind the church, the adult church
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.480]   on the whole.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.760]   So you'll have had access to it.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.300]   You'll have studied it.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.160]   And then you can review it with your children.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   Okay?
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.960]   So we are trying to unify our entire education department.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.680]   I actually did some math.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.880]   Without any new families, let's say we don't bring in another new person in our church,
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.040]   our youth group is going to be about 70 in about five years.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.480]   Our children's ministry will be about 160 in five years.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:44.960]   And depending on how productive or how unproductive you guys are and how people inbreed and stuff,
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.420]   we might be at another 150 for the nursery.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.200]   So I'm not planning for this year.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.600]   I'm planning for the next five and then thinking ahead to the next ten.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.000]   So we do need to structure it.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.560]   Some of you guys might be thinking, wait, we have 20 youth group kids, but we have eight
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.560]   teachers?
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   Great.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.880]   Because if we add another 30 youth group kids, our teachers are ready to take that on.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.120]   So that's without any new families coming in.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:19.820]   So one thing that we do ask for is there's going to be a lot of unorganized stuff.
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.680]   Because we're trying to prep for the next five to ten.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.400]   So one, if you're like, well, this is so unorganized, you can complain to me.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.400]   But that's fine.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.640]   And then I'll just pray sanctification on your life.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.480]   But just be patient with us and help us.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.320]   And what I don't want are most of our children's ministry, youth group department, teachers
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.920]   to come from young adults.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.900]   I would rather have us as families help families.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:53.080]   So as a family unit, if you have a desire to serve in the education department, please
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.080]   let us know.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.280]   I mean, we do have criteria.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:02.600]   But our desire is for it to be the families leading our education department.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.600]   Amen?
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.600]   Okay?
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   And that's hard.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.040]   Because you guys are like, I need to spend time with the Lord.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.040]   I'm tired.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.240]   But rest doesn't come by inactivity.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.620]   Rest comes from doing and serving in a way that rekindles the why in your life.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.860]   So the worksheets, fourth grade and up, we'll be doing those, the worksheets in class on
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.860]   Sunday.
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.620]   K through third, the worksheets are going home with you.
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.220]   And I'm going to be putting them up on the family ministry page.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.140]   Just curriculum, the PDF.
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.540]   So you get it every week.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.320]   So you know what your children are doing.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.020]   But this is not meant for the kid to do this for homework.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.220]   Are you guys following me?
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:47.180]   It's for you to see what we're doing as an education department and then tailor digesting
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.280]   it for your child.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.300]   And the seeds, it's going to continue with how it's done.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.060]   And we're going to get to that when we introduce each department.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.060]   All right?
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:03.440]   And as of September 1st, I'm going to be the pastor overseeing the youth ministry.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.360]   So the children's ministry, I've been preaching to them for about a year's time.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.680]   But the teachers are now going to rotate through the children's ministry.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.160]   And I'm moving to do the youth on Fridays and Sundays.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.240]   And as the youth teachers have shared or the parents have shared, I do have big shoes to
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.400]   fill.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.560]   Pastor Mark really did a good job ministering to those children.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.580]   But I'm moving into that role.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.320]   And so this is what our youth group will look like on Friday nights.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.960]   I'm going to be doing a Bible just surveys.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.800]   So the children will be able to know what's where in the Bible in a way that's easy to
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.840]   remember.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.680]   So we'll start with Bible and then Old Testament survey and then New Testament survey in a
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:51.200]   way where they'll get to know what each of the books of the Bible is about and then try
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:57.560]   to help them navigate through just the whole of Scripture so they could inductively study
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.680]   it on their own at 13, 14, 15, 16.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.280]   Hopefully that is amenable to you guys.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.520]   Sunday we're doing a Philippians.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.960]   And then when we have praise and prayer, we're taking a break because we don't want to get
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.280]   off the schedule.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.280]   So Philippians is what we'll be doing on Sunday.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.560]   So for you, you should know what your kids are learning that Sunday because you will
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.520]   have prepared it at home on your own two weeks prior.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.500]   So this is an encouragement for you to be more involved with your child's spiritual
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.880]   education without adding anything.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.720]   So it's just like let's maximize what we're already at.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.040]   So our boys are going to be broken up this way.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.160]   And I actually have the teachers stand here because we do have some new families.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.760]   Ryan, Matt, Sky, Sam, Kate.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.680]   Amber's in, I think she's, there's a conference going on and she's there.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.680]   But oh, she's not here.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.720]   Oh, Sam's not here either.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   Okay.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:00.880]   So Ryan Chang right there in the burgundy, he's going to be the teacher and small group
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.560]   leader for Charles, Jamie, and George.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.960]   Matt Yee, he was one of the reasons we started children's ministry.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.880]   So he was in like the second grade when he came to Berean and I had him then.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.880]   So he was our fourth grade youth group student because we had fourth to seniors and three-year-olds
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.020]   to third grade.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.160]   So our church was even more chaotic then, believe it or not, our education department.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:31.020]   But Matt is a product of the labor, the baton passing labor.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:38.760]   And now he's full circle and he's going to influence either positively or negatively
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.440]   the next generation.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.840]   Sky has been a staple at Berean youth.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.720]   So she's going to be taking Faith, Hope, Pauline, and Priscilla.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.520]   Sam Ho, who you guys know, but she's not here.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.760]   Taylor, Edelise, and then Julia.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:01.460]   Kate, who's Ryan's wife, will be Amy Charity and Mary Mobley's small group leader Sunday
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.820]   school teacher.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:08.060]   And then Amber, who is one of our most recent college graduates, she'll have Audrey and
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.600]   Irene.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:18.100]   And this is a pretty good ratio, but any new students that come in, we have more than enough
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.480]   just love and energy and space to cater to them.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.620]   So please pray over them, youth group teachers.
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.520]   So every Friday night they're going to be here ministering to your children.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.300]   So please remember them, pray for them.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.300]   Okay, I'm going to ask you guys to take a seat.
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.300]   Yay.
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.300]   Woohoo.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.660]   And I do want to introduce the Sprouts.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.500]   And I'll go through this relatively quickly because there are some detailed things that
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.740]   we do need to talk up in terms of safety and stuff like that toward the end.
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.140]   So this is our staff.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:59.540]   I don't know if you guys can see it clearly, but we have 13 staff in the Sprouts department,
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:04.300]   which is our children's ministry.
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.580]   And then the class breakdowns, can I have you guys come up, the teachers?
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:16.540]   Because like I said, we do have a few new families here so that they know who's who.
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:23.660]   There's a big group.
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:31.260]   So my philosophy is the more people doing less, the better.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:37.220]   So we have a lot of teachers and so that the teachers take turns really preparing the lessons
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:42.960]   and there is a lot of love and care that goes into individual students.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.360]   And we do have probably, there's going to be about 50 to 60 kids just in September.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.780]   But kindergarten, the kindergarten students, Mara's done a great job this past year.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.540]   So she's taking the kinders again.
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:14:00.860]   So Mara, Chris, and then Nick Yu is going to be helping with the kindergarten students.
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.260]   The first graders, as you guys can see there.
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:08.940]   So if your child is going to be a first grader in the fall, Josh, just raise your hands.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.860]   Josh, Kiani, keep your hands raised.
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.300]   Kiani, John Yang, and Gloria who's not here, they're going to be the ones taking care of
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.940]   the first graders.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.540]   Second grade students, Joe and Michelle, these two, they're going to be the ones in charge
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.380]   of the second graders.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.460]   Third and fourth grade, it's a combined class.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:32.640]   Melissa Wong, who's been here, she is now the longest tenured Bereans teacher.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.620]   She overthrew Matt Chong.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.940]   And I recruited her back in like '08, '09.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.820]   So she's stuck.
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.300]   And then Stephen Mose is also going to be doing third and fourth grade.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.700]   And Florence Yu, she's right there.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.560]   And Chris are going to be with the oldest children.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.380]   And so give them a round of applause.
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.220]   They're going to be the ones who've loved on your children.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.500]   We have 100% engagement.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.180]   So they all came back.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.780]   And so we added just three more teachers.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.820]   So they're going to be doing the children's ministry.
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:16.700]   You guys can go ahead and take your seats.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.080]   So this is what Sunday school looks like for the children's ministry.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.660]   And I will upload the PowerPoint to the Berean Family Facebook page.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.060]   So you guys can just access it and look it over on your own.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.580]   1045, we'll do a teacher huddle and prayer.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.300]   1115, we have a praise and offering.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:42.820]   And I do want to emphasize because we do have a number of families coming at 1130, 1140
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.060]   regularly.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.820]   And that's not a one-time thing.
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.900]   That's regularly.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.900]   And you guys know that the service starts at 1115.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:55.540]   And Pastor Peter always says, "Your faith to the next generation is caught more than
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.540]   it is taught."
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:01.140]   Meaning, they're not going to always listen to what you say, but they're going to observe
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:06.660]   what you do and pick up what the values and the priorities are in your family by that.
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:12.140]   So if your family is regularly coming at 1130, that means the praise time for your family
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.020]   indirectly gets communicated as not that important.
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:23.060]   So if you are coming here for yourself at 1115, you need to check your kids in by 1105.
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.860]   And just another, I mean, this is the only opportunity I have.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.100]   So I'm not coming down on you.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:32.540]   But like we do have parents outside hanging out 1120, and the kids can hear the praise
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.300]   starting and the parents chatting and giggling in the back.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.920]   So just know that our kids see everything.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:47.860]   And so that's something just as an encouragement, what you value is caught by your kids rather
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:48.940]   than taught.
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:54.100]   And so my encouragement is help them prepare their hearts for worship to understand that
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.900]   Sunday morning is priority for the family.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.900]   Amen?
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.900]   Can you just give me a little, yeah.
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.900]   Some of you guys are like, "Amen!"
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:05.900]   Yes.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.700]   1115, so there's a 20-minute, usually a 15-minute sermon.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.860]   And then there's an activity or an application with the class, memory verses.
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.340]   So they've broken up into their Bible study classes.
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.180]   There's a review and closing praise.
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.300]   And then there's the "Because He Lives" at 1245.
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:30.220]   And so the parents, if the Sunday's done at like 1230, and just because you're socially
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:34.180]   like a little bit like, "I don't want to hang out with people," don't come and grab your
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.580]   kid out of class.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:41.900]   And so please just respect the 1245 time.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.140]   And then we do have a sponsor child in our Sprouts.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.740]   The kids are asked to bring a dollar every month.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:53.100]   And we ask you not to give them a dollar.
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:58.460]   They have to somehow earn it so that they understand, "I am doing this for this person
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.700]   who's in Ecuador, Luis.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.140]   I'm meeting him next week with our teachers.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.540]   I'm going to his house.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:08.460]   So I'm going to share with your children what situation, like what his living situation
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.340]   is, et cetera, et cetera."
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.060]   So just that's a first of every month.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:19.500]   You will get email reminder, little message reminders just to send a dollar with your
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.500]   child.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.500]   If you want to...
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.660]   Like, some parents are like, "You know, I don't want to think that far.
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.660]   Here's 10 bucks.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.140]   Don't bother me for the year."
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:36.500]   We want your child to learn every month what it means to intentionally pray for and take
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:41.860]   care of a child that is not necessarily related to them.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:46.140]   I'm going to give you guys an opportunity to ask questions at the end.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.940]   Right now I'm going to ask Jenny Kim to come up and share about the seeds.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.940]   All right.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.940]   I'll do the slides.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:55.940]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.940]   You can hear me.
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:03.940]   So I don't need a mic.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.940]   Go, go, go, go.
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.940]   Try, try, try.
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.940]   Go now.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:10.940]   Go now.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:11.940]   All right.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.940]   Thank you, everyone.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.940]   So I'm Jenny.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.980]   For those who don't know, some people call me Jenni at Berean.
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.340]   I'm here to just present on behalf of our seeds.
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.040]   So I want to start off with our roster.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:29.440]   So as you guys can see up here on the screen, our class sizes are getting much bigger.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.460]   So last year we were projected to...
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:36.060]   By last year, I mean this school year, we're projected to end at the end of August with
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.540]   77 students.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.860]   So you can see that that number is growing.
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:45.140]   Every year since we've had our ministry, it's grown about 10 to 15 students.
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.700]   And that's not counting our newcomers.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.380]   That's just our committed families.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.220]   Because I know a lot of you guys are having your seconds or your thirds or more.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.760]   So we want to make sure that we're ready.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.420]   So we always have a running roster going.
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.260]   So we wanted you guys to take a look.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.340]   Now when you see the class D and E, I know that'll be a little bit confusing.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.540]   What that is talking about is really everything that's in class C. But we call it D and E
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.540]   because of their age.
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.140]   So we split it per age.
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:18.820]   And so that you know the class sizes, we do have newcomers coming every single week.
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.860]   So just anticipate that that number will continue to grow over time.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.860]   So we're going to have 86.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.860]   A lot of kids.
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:25.860]   All right.
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.860]   We used to think 50 was big.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.980]   It's like, it's a lot more than that.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:34.460]   So with our growing number, obviously we went ahead and we added new teachers into our group.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.020]   For those of you who don't know the teachers by name, they're all up there for you.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:44.820]   And what I'm doing is I used to be in class C with the other leaders, but I'm being transitioned
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:50.880]   to class B because now we need to class, we need to split class B between girls and boys.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.800]   Not so much for first service because first service we don't have a lot of students coming
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.460]   in, but more for second.
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.260]   Today we had 16 kids, right?
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.420]   And so we split the boys and the girls.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.900]   Because they're transitioning from a monthly lesson that they learn every single week of
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:09.380]   that month in class C to having a new lesson, a new memory verse every single week.
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.500]   So that can be a really big transition for the kids.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.340]   And so we want to give them a little more focus, a little more attention when they're
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:20.480]   in class B before they get to class C. I'm sorry, class A. So you know the breakdown.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.420]   What we cover in class C is we kind of go through the Bible.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.500]   We go thematically.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.300]   So Jesus is big and strong.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.300]   God is good.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.300]   Things like that.
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.300]   Right?
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.300]   Or I'm sorry, God is big and strong.
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.300]   So is Jesus.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.620]   But yeah, we go over that.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.620]   Okay.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:34.980]   So we go over that monthly throughout the year.
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.060]   And we have one memory verse each month.
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.060]   Okay?
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:43.860]   We go over Old Testament once they get into class B. And then in class A, they go over
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:44.860]   the New Testament.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:45.860]   Okay?
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.020]   So that you know the themes of that.
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.620]   So with all of our teachers, because now we're at 11, right?
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:56.100]   We also have a host of responsibilities that we've split up between us.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.100]   Okay?
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.800]   Obviously, as you know, Sarah is our head honcho.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.100]   She does an excellent job with ministry, with the ministry.
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.820]   So she's our principal.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.820]   Okay?
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.260]   And I'm in charge of the safety portion.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.180]   Praise is with Jane and Rachel.
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.460]   We have volunteer staff relations.
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.460]   Okay?
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.540]   With Andy and Carla.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.820]   So we monitor the schedule, the rotation, all that.
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.980]   Make sure everyone's, you know, with all the commitments that we've made in the year that
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.260]   we are sticking to that.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:28.180]   Newcomer relations, since we're having a huge surge of newcomers, we've needed more focus
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.180]   on that from our leaders.
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:34.780]   So, praise, obviously, you guys see the fruit of that through the YouTube channel.
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.940]   Media is handled by Mel and Kat.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:41.020]   They handle the newsletter, any parent forums, things like that that we need to get out to
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.020]   you.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.180]   And prayer for your little ones is handled by Crystal.
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.820]   Okay?
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.180]   So this is the schedule for both of our services.
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.940]   So that you guys have the breakdown as well.
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.940]   Okay?
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.820]   I know most of you are pretty accustomed to the breakdown.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.500]   I don't see a lot of new families here.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.740]   So if you guys are, you know, the old timers, all right?
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.060]   So you guys kind of have already got this down pat.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.500]   But just so you know kind of how that's broken down.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.860]   All right?
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:08.860]   Okay?
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.060]   And we just have some important reminders that we want to make sure that we let everybody
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.060]   know.
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.060]   Okay?
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.260]   First is that with communication, we always use our Facebook page.
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.140]   So please make sure that you're checking that regularly.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.140]   Okay?
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.020]   If there's any kind of notifications that come to you, make sure that you do that.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.620]   I know some of you do not have Facebook, and that's completely fine.
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:30.940]   If you don't and you didn't know about this, that we regularly use our Facebook page, just
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.580]   let me know so that we can add you into the emailing list.
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.580]   Okay?
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.580]   And we'll make sure that you guys are there.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.580]   All right?
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.580]   Safety training.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.100]   This is not obviously mandated for our parents.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.420]   But I've seen parents attend our safety training, and they're really pleased with what we've
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:48.180]   had, you know, put in place for the safety of their kids.
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.900]   So we do highly encourage our parents to go ahead and take safety training if you guys
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.380]   want to see what we have in place.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.460]   All right?
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.920]   As far as reviewing lessons and memory verses, I know this is something that we've touched
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:02.100]   upon a lot in the past with a lot of our parents that have been, you know, coming to SEADS
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.100]   for a while.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:07.660]   But obviously for us, you know, our philosophy is that the teaching starts at home, and we're
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.820]   here as a supplemental resource to reinforce those lessons that you guys are constantly
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.780]   reviewing and, you know, going over with your kids.
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.140]   So we just want to encourage parents, you know, as much as you can, please try to take
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:24.140]   time to review the memory verse, make sure that you try to explain in your own way.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.900]   Because sometimes when it comes from the teacher, it's not the same as when it comes from mom
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.900]   or dad.
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:28.900]   You know?
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.380]   You guys know your kids the best, so you can explain it the best.
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.260]   And so it's really helpful in that way to partner in that effort.
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.460]   Okay?
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:44.820]   We also want to talk about on the next slide� is there a slide?
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.020]   Ooh.
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.420]   So let me just tell you what the slide says.
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.420]   Okay?
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.580]   I don't know what's missing.
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:54.580]   So snacks.
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:59.140]   I know some parents don't know, but we do ask that parents pack snacks for their kids
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:03.700]   every week for SEADS so that we can go ahead and give it to them during the snack time.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.260]   Should your child forget, no worries.
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.460]   We just look at the back of their tag.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:11.020]   If you guys said snacks, okay, we give them what we have in our SEADS office.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.620]   But we have that for any families that might have forgotten that week.
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.260]   You know, it was crazy in the morning, right?
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.100]   You can't get the snacks packed, right?
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.100]   It's fine.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.100]   You know we got snacks, right?
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.420]   We'll make sure your kid does not go hungry, all right?
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.780]   And so don't worry about that.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.620]   But if you guys could pack that, that would be great.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.500]   The other thing we always tell parents is no peanuts, please.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.740]   We have some kids that have really severe allergies.
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.580]   We wouldn't want to have to take out an EpiPen or something.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.180]   You know, I don't want to do that.
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.860]   So if you guys could maybe, you know, stay away from the peanuts, that would be great.
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.980]   Or nuts in general.
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.380]   And then so labels.
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:49.700]   If you guys could make sure you label your snacks, you know, the snack packs or the sippy
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.860]   cups or your backpacks.
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:56.140]   We have a lot more students now, especially with 85 plus, right?
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.140]   It's going to be even crazier.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.460]   And a lot of them are starting to have the same stuff.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.300]   So we're like, who's is this?
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:06.780]   I know Uriah has the same stuff as like Eleanor, so I'm always checking is it milk or water,
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.780]   right?
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.340]   But if you guys could help us and do a label, that would be great.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.340]   Okay?
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.340]   Okay.
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:17.140]   And if you guys have not potty training kids, sometimes there's accidents, right?
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:21.660]   So if you want a Ziploc, like an extra set of clothes, we will just tuck it into their
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.940]   cubby and we'll make sure we take care of you.
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.940]   Okay?
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:30.220]   And then if you want a parent resource binder or folder, it's just $5 to class A and B,
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.220]   C, no charge.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.220]   Okay?
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.980]   If you could cash, check or Venmo or PayPal, Sarah, that would be great.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.980]   And that's it.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.980]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:38.980]   >> Church.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:39.980]   >> Church.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.980]   What?
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:41.980]   >> Venmo, church.
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.380]   >> Oh, Venmo, church.
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.380]   Not Sarah.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.380]   Venmo, church, guys.
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.380]   Okay?
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.380]   Excuse me.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.380]   Thank you.
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.380]   Thank you, Kat.
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:59.100]   [ Applause ] >> The next thing we're going to be talking
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:05.300]   about is we're going to change up our check-in process a little bit.
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.900]   What we want to do is protect our kids to make sure that they're safe.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:14.260]   And so if you guys have noticed, midpoint in the year, we stopped allowing cars to park
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.260]   there.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.260]   Right?
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:20.320]   So our kids, you know, so that area is actually a lot more free.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:26.140]   But we are going to change up the just check-in just to make it a little bit more efficient.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.700]   Brother Joshan is going to come up and just share how it's all going to work out.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.700]   So Joe.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.700]   Hold it.
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.700]   Hello?
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.700]   Joe is in the back.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.700]   Hello?
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.700]   Hello?
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.700]   Hello?
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.700]   Joe is in the back.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.700]   Hello?
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.700]   Testing.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.700]   Hold on.
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.700]   Okay.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:43.700]   So -- >> Is Josh going to demonstrate?
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:44.700]   >> I'll just talk loudly.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:50.740]   Over there, if you take a look at the front, there's going to be on the left and the right
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:55.300]   side of the entrance a check-in stand that Josh is holding right now.
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.300]   Okay?
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:01.580]   And basically on the check-in stand, what you're going to have is whether you are in
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:06.500]   seeds or in sprouts, you can check them in.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.860]   Any of the check-in stands will check in both.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:09.860]   Okay?
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:14.260]   After you check them in, you're going to walk them into the entrance where it says sprouts
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.100]   and seeds entrance.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:21.860]   And then only for sprouts, if they're late, if they're late, we ask you to check them
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:27.020]   in in the check-in kiosk and then walk around and come in through the back way.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.180]   All right?
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.260]   That's pretty much it.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:40.820]   So I'm going to actually show you what that check-in process looks like.
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:49.860]   There we go.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.860]   Okay.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.140]   So it's going to look like this.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.380]   Essentially all you have to do is enter your phone number.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:03.380]   So let me give you an example.
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:10.620]   Okay.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:14.540]   So I did the Mowgli's because there's five of them.
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.940]   He did the Mowgli family because there's lots of examples to use.
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:24.700]   So similar to the check-in that you do for breeze for a members meeting, it's the same
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.700]   thing.
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:31.100]   All you have to do is check them and the check mark means that they're checked in.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:38.980]   If you're only going to check in three, select three and then click on done.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.300]   And then after that, they'll be checked in.
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.820]   Sorry, it's lagging a little bit, but they're checked in.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:49.020]   So for the check-in process is going to be, ignore that though.
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.180]   For the check-in process, that's all it's going to be.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.280]   It's going to be based off your phone numbers.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.880]   So we pretty much have everyone in the system.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.100]   All they have to do is you have to just enter your phone number.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.100]   Okay.
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.860]   For checkout, can we go back?
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:07.140]   Oh, for the checkout process, essentially we're just going to have them come in, pick
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.500]   them up the way they're normally are.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:15.340]   But we just ask for now to just please keep the entrance way as clear as possible.
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:20.660]   And then there will probably be changes maybe in the future.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.660]   It'll be TBA.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.540]   Did you guys all hear that?
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.540]   No?
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.540]   Okay.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.220]   So the check-in process is going to be what Joe demonstrated.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:36.700]   The checkout is going to be the same as we've had it, but we may change it.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:43.740]   Only request is don't crowd around and socialize and fellowship just around the front door
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.880]   to kind of crowd the area.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:52.320]   And so collect your child and move them and yourselves to a different part of the church
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.840]   where space is a lot more readily available.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.360]   Okay.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:04.040]   So okay, we'll hold off on questions until this last part.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:13.480]   So we actually have a SOEvents ministry, Iwana Reformation Night, and then we have VBS and
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:21.080]   whatever other, as our church gets bigger, this will only continue to grow alongside
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.660]   of that.
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:31.680]   So VBS, usually we have it in July, Reformation Night, usually on the night of October 31st.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.240]   And Iwana, we are actually starting that for the first time this fall.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:43.240]   So it's going to be our Guinea Pig Iwana held on Thursday nights.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   What is Iwana?
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:50.920]   It's approved workmen are not ashamed, coming from 2 Timothy 2.15.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:57.080]   So we're adopting much of what is done in the national Iwana.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.240]   So students are divided according to their age, grade levels, and BCC will begin our
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:06.880]   first year of Iwana with just two of the groups, kindergarten to second graders, and then the
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.320]   third through sixth.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:13.280]   This is what it will look like starting September.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.280]   Thursdays 7 to 8.30.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.800]   6.45, children arrive.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:23.080]   7 o'clock, we have a large group in games, depending on the age of the children.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:28.120]   Small group, large group, games in small group, and then 8.30 is when the children are picked
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.120]   up.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:34.000]   Right now, we're not opening it up to outside, non-Berean families, mainly because we want
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.160]   to figure out how to run it for our church.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:44.160]   And so if you guys are familiar with Iwana, it is a lot of incentive-based memory, just
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.080]   rote memorization, memorize verses, play games.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:53.160]   It is a lot of fun, but we do want to try to tailor it to, it's not just, you're not
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:58.120]   just learning God's word for candy and for points and for toys and prizes.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:03.740]   So we do want to tailor it to our church's core values and needs.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:12.760]   So we are going to work with this year and try to figure out what's the best way to continue
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.760]   going forward.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.280]   So as of now, we are not opening it up to outside families.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:24.040]   If you guys see here, we are always in search of people to help.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:29.400]   So if you guys have the heart to do this, you can talk to Jane Shin.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:34.880]   Christine and Hannah Michelle Chong are the admins, and we have Becky, Laurel, Bia, and
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:39.880]   Mama as the leaders of the children.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:45.120]   And they're all the leaders, so far a lot of the leaders' wives, and hopefully we can
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:52.140]   transition other parents to come in and also participate over the course of time.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.620]   And we have Rachel and Lindsay helping with the games.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.380]   So if you, it doesn't mean we can't use your help.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.340]   If you'd like to volunteer, please let Jane Shin know.
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:05.600]   If you don't know who she is, you'll find out soon enough.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:10.520]   If you need her email address, it's on all of our programs, okay, for just to contact
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.340]   Jane Shin, okay?
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.960]   So help us help you.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:20.260]   So what we are hoping for for Rwana is for the parents who are dropping off their kids
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.400]   to be fully involved, to help teach, plan, and organize.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.960]   Help us help you, okay?
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:31.840]   So this doesn't work if it's not implemented also at home.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:36.040]   And lastly, before I open it up to questions, we do have our safety training, and right
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:40.700]   now we are in a lot of discussion on how to improve this.
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:46.840]   As of right now, it's a lot of child protection-related things, like who is able to take whom to the
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:52.680]   bathroom, who can change diapers, what we require of all of our, the people who are
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.680]   working with the children.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:59.480]   But we do at some point wanna incorporate even like some degree of disaster training,
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.200]   some degree of emergency protocol.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   And so we are in the works for that.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.800]   Please do not bombard our email addresses with like concerns and stuff.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:14.720]   We are preparing for that and trying to figure out what's best for the church, not just for
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.680]   any particular family.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:22.840]   But we do have the next safety training, September 15th at 2 p.m. here.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:27.920]   And if you are a parent, my encouragement would be to come to this, because at some
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:34.080]   point, because we're asking you to get involved with our education department, you can't just
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.200]   work with your child, right?
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.400]   And so the sooner this is done, the easier it is for us to move you around.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.800]   There's a lot of people at our church, last minute they wanna like sign up to help with
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.280]   the VBS and Reformation Night and things like that.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:54.040]   But because we do have a policy in place, you have to be safety trained, so we can't
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.760]   take on, like we can't take on a lot of the people.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:03.760]   So our encouragement is we do offer this quarterly, and when you can, please take advantage.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:10.040]   And so it'll, time frame will feel like today, just two to three-ish.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.300]   So if you can, please sign up and participate in this.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:20.120]   If you have any questions concerning our safety training, you can talk to Jane Shin, okay?
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:26.280]   Now I do wanna open it up to questions that's related to all the education department.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:31.300]   I don't have all the answers, but there are people here who probably have the answers
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.300]   that I don't.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:41.120]   And so any of the parents, if you guys have any questions or concerns or anything, what
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:44.440]   do I do if I don't have a Facebook, et cetera, et cetera, like anything.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:49.960]   If you don't, if no one raises their hand in 10 seconds, I'm gonna like pray.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.280]   Yeah, Tommy.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.920]   (indistinct)
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:37:00.800]   Although, the curriculum?
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.400]   Okay.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.400]   (indistinct)
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:35.220]   >> So, this is what your children are going to be getting sent home.
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.160]   It's going to be on the Facebook page.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.160]   Here's lesson one.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.880]   I'm going to scroll up.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:46.680]   It's just an overview of Philippians.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:53.880]   So we're looking at like just Paul's journey in Acts 16 to how the church in Philippi gets
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:59.000]   started with an outline.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.280]   Most worksheets are going to be four pages, but because this is an overview, I felt like
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.760]   our kids needed to get a little bit of context.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:12.200]   So the workbook instructions, they're going to be asked to read an assigned passage, read
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:18.480]   over the prep questions, read over the discussion questions mentally, and/or write down the
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.920]   answers for Sunday and review the memory verse.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.720]   And then here, this is what the curriculum's going to look like, chapter one, verses one
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.720]   to two, lesson one.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.480]   Remember the last time you wrote a warm, love-filled letter to someone?
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.880]   It probably started with an affectionate "Dear" blank or a resounding "Hello," et cetera,
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.880]   et cetera.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.720]   So this was a letter from Paul with different translations.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.880]   Oops, see, this changed.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.280]   This is the Word document.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.280]   I have a PDF.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.680]   It's fine.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.640]   But who sent the letter?
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:52.920]   What title did they give themselves with the discussion of what a doulos is, a bond servant?
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:57.320]   If you guys haven't picked up on it, in Acts 16, the slave girl follows him around calling
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.320]   "Douloy, douloy, douloy."
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:06.040]   And so Paul, this is the only other letter outside of Titus where he writes "bond servants."
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.360]   And so I thought that was interesting.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.880]   So this is going to be just a little discussion on that.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.200]   And then discussion questions, describing your own words, what a slave does, how he
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.840]   serves, lives, what is a saint, okay?
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:26.880]   Looking at the past context of a slave, how would you define grace and peace in your own
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.880]   words?
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   And then discussion questions.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.720]   When we become Christians, we are automatically given the title and rights of sons and daughters,
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.720]   prince and heir.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.760]   Will we also inherit the title doulos of Jesus Christ?
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.720]   How do these titles affect the way we can and ought to live?
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.760]   So just questions for our children, regardless of their age.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:49.800]   So our kindergarten teachers are not going to whip these questions to class.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:54.560]   So our kindergarten teachers are actually very good at contextualizing for their age.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.640]   They'll probably take one question and go off that for the whole hour and then do show
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.380]   and tell and then eat snacks, okay?
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:09.600]   So depending on the age, they will go either very deep or just light, okay?
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:14.560]   So you as a parent, when you see this at home, you didn't go through, the teacher didn't
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.160]   go through every single question.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.600]   And it is not homework.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.320]   Some overachieving church parents, so that their child never flunks church, they do all
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   of this.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:29.160]   And we're so blessed by that, but that is not necessarily holiness, nor is that required
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.160]   from our church.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:35.240]   This is a benefit and a resource for you, not something that we're going to check, okay?
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.280]   So you're going to be the one checking.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.840]   And then a memory verse, Galatians 2 20, and that's just our first lesson.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.960]   And all the other lessons are going to be four pages with the same format.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:50.440]   Text, question, question, discussion, memory verse.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.200]   And so I don't know how long I can keep this up, but we'll try to figure this out.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:59.760]   Because our education department, one thing that we don't have in modern day Christendom
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:07.640]   is Bible-based curriculum for children that just, because it's a lot of topic-based stuff.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:13.240]   And it's not too early to start them on inductive study and focus on just the word of God.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.280]   And I'm assuming you guys would agree with that.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:21.040]   It's just, there's no way we can produce curriculum that is age appropriate for every age.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:27.720]   So as of right now, until we deem that this is not practical, we'll just keep it this
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.720]   way.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.720]   But thank you, Tommy.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.480]   So this is the curriculum.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.960]   I have it done for Philippians.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:39.000]   This was easy because I did this with our Berean students a decade ago.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.480]   So I just edited it and modified it and updated it a little bit.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.880]   So hopefully we can do this.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.880]   Yes?
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.280]   Is it going to be passed out with the children or?
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:54.080]   It's going to be passed out to your children who are in Sprouts and Youth, not the seats.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:42:01.040]   I didn't, like, get to the school time.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.240]   But then some parents, some of the kids are going to need it for their class.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.240]   Oh, okay.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.240]   Oh, thank you.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.240]   Yes?
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.240]   So the seats are still safe and I didn't order them for the same.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.240]   Right.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:19.720]   So we're teaching out of the NASB, but as you guys can see on this thing, we're using
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:25.240]   what basically are, like, the whole gamut of our church uses, well, ESV, NIV, NASB.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:29.020]   I don't know what other translations are commonly used, but these are the most common ones.
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:35.640]   So all the pastors are teaching out of the NAS, but for the NAS, for children, it is
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.080]   very difficult to read.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.160]   But we understand that.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:44.440]   But a lot of that is we want to help them read it and then help them read it rather
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:49.200]   than just make a children's interpretation of it.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.800]   So we'll see how it goes.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:58.160]   Our memory versus we've heard it's very wooden in the NAS, but as of right now, I think we'll
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.160]   try it.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:03.960]   And if we need to adjust it and if you guys, like, throw a hissy fit and just have a mass,
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:10.000]   like, complaint, "We bring back NIV," or something, then we will possibly say no.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.640]   But we'll figure it out.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.640]   For Cs, it'll be NIV and then NAS.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:23.780]   We do, we did have, we purchased some NASB children's Bibles, which they came out with.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.780]   It's just pictures.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.800]   It's just, it's nothing different.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:32.160]   But we are going to try to keep with the NASB, but use all three of the commonly used translations.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:36.760]   >> Does the stuff allow you to memorize it?
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.760]   >> Of course.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.080]   So the kids can memorize in the NIV.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:45.760]   But just for uniformity's sake, we'll say we're going to use NAS.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.260]   Good question.
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.260]   Anybody else?
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.260]   Yes, Marsha.
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:55.260]   >> So for the high schoolers, the fact that you can tell if they're at least one grade
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:44:02.260]   from the 7.0, does that mean they're going to take it home?
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:03.260]   >> Yes.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.820]   So they're doing this in class.
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.840]   Obviously they're not going to be able to do all of it.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.520]   So they are going to take it home.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:17.180]   But my hope is that, see, biblical information dispensation is not our job.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:21.380]   Ours is to see what their heart's needs are.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:28.660]   And though the platform is this text, if in the class our student has like an important
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:36.060]   issue, if they get stuck on if God is sovereign, how can he allow A, B, and C, I want to encourage
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:42.620]   our teachers, it's okay to put the text aside a little bit, have them do it at home, but
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.660]   really address the student's question.
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.220]   Because those are valid questions.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:51.740]   And so, yeah, we don't ever want to be like, what do we do in class?
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:57.980]   So it's -- but it usually, like, if they pay attention in class, usually it's done.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.100]   This is eight pages because it's the overview.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.420]   Usually it's just four.
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:06.260]   And it's just usually two pages of activity and study.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:12.720]   And then the first and last page are not -- you go through it real quick.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.720]   Anybody else?
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.720]   Yes.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:25.020]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:30.940]   If you have a question for your department or your teachers, who do we ask?
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:35.300]   So our point person for our seeds is Sarah.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.180]   Our sprouts is Gloria Choi.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.180]   She's not here.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.440]   Gloria Choi.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.220]   And our youth group is going to be Ryan Chang.
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.140]   I'll actually -- I'll include that on the slide.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:52.940]   Sarah, Gloria, and Ryan are our main contact people for the parents to -- and if you shoot
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:57.860]   me an email, I'm not going to, like, look -- like, just be judgmental.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.980]   I'll just forward it to them.
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.140]   But they're your people.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:09.840]   Ideally, the less I am directly involved in any of the departments, the more effective
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.620]   I will be able to minister as a pastor.
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:16.040]   So our goal is to set this up for five years ahead.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.140]   And so like I shared before, we do need a lot of your patience.
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:24.820]   We do need a lot of your help to set up something where even, like I -- even if we don't add
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:27.540]   a new family, our church gets big.
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.340]   And that's a challenge.
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.620]   And space becomes a problem.
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:37.540]   And so it's -- we're trying to do this to set it up so that we can sustain this long
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:38.540]   term.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:41.780]   So -- but for now, I mean, those are the people.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.780]   Maybe one or two more questions.
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:43.780]   Yes, Janet.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.780]   >> When do you move up the church?
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.220]   >> Ah, good question.
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.940]   September 1st, everything happens.
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:50.940]   Everything is changing.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.340]   And it's a Sunday.
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:56.700]   So I will officially start in the youth group September 1st.
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.780]   Nobody's moving up, actually, to the youth group.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:05.100]   But our kindergarteners will, like, come in to our sprouts for the first time on September
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.100]   1st.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:13.260]   And we'll have things September 1st, usually till August of the following year.
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.420]   Any other questions?
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:19.100]   Pray for us.
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:25.140]   I think there's a feeling of being overwhelmed in all the teachers and feeling of, like,
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.140]   what do we do?
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.220]   There's a lot of work to be done.
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:30.500]   And so right now, it's our transition stage.
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.820]   And so please pray for us.
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:38.580]   And if you guys want to know what our prayer requests are, you can ask.
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:45.340]   But ultimately, we want to build a church as a whole that really honors God, honors
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:50.600]   his word, and really focuses on just disciple making here and abroad.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:57.460]   And so whatever our role can be with our children, we'll try to have that same vision, okay?
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.060]   Cater to the younger kids.
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:01.180]   All right?
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:05.180]   If you have any more questions, please just email somebody.
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.660]   Or I mean, you can email me.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:11.140]   And we'll go from there.
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.140]   All right?
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:14.260]   We're only going to have these parents meetings maybe once a year.
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:17.340]   So you guys, I don't like meetings.
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:18.500]   And I don't like long meetings.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.140]   And so that's probably good news.
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:23.100]   So if you don't have a Facebook, you're going to be out of the loop.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:28.300]   If you want to just set one up and then just say, like, Mickey Mouse, and then you email
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:32.580]   me and be like, this is Tim Irving.
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.820]   But I put Mickey Mouse.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:34.820]   Right?
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.620]   We'll just secretly add you on the slide.
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:37.620]   All right?
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:41.420]   And then we will not tell anybody who Mickey Mouse is.
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:42.420]   Okay?
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:48.380]   So, but we do need, like, because there is, all the other channels are very difficult
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.460]   for us to just organize and, you guys understand, right?
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.940]   So if you don't have Facebook and you don't want to get it, and that's fine.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:59.060]   But just remind us to remind you via email.
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.500]   All right?
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.500]   So yeah.
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.500]   We'll dismiss.
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:03.500]   Let me pray for us.
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:08.380]   And then we'll dismiss this PowerPoint.
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:11.660]   And this first lesson, I will put on the family ministry page.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:12.660]   Okay?
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:15.420]   So you could just kind of check it out.
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:16.420]   Okay?
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:20.700]   Lord, we thank you for just your kindness to our church.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:25.300]   I pray that our church will not become an idol, that our children will not become our
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:30.260]   life's purpose, but that we would all face in the same direction, that we would all seek
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:33.340]   to build your church, whether we're seven or 70.
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:41.300]   So I pray for your help just to be able to discern what is practical and what is godly,
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:50.660]   to help us to discern what is good from what is better, and help us to really work toward
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:59.860]   enabling and equipping our children to fight battles in a godly and an effective way.
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.420]   And Lord, we need help.
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:02.860]   They need help.
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:08.460]   And Lord God, we pray that you would raise up just men and women of faith through this
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.340]   church as you see me pray.
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:11.340]   Amen.
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.340]   All right.
