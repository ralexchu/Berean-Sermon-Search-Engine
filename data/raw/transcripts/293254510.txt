[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   (no audio)
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.720]   - I'll introduce myself.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.720]   I'm Valerie.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.200]   I am a parent.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.040]   I have two kids, Micah and Calvin.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.080]   So one's named Sprouts and one is named Z.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.420]   And then I have one husband named James.
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.060]   (laughter)
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.900]   - Why, why?
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.680]   - Yes, and we've been at Brandy's for a really long time.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.180]   We've been at Brandy's since I was in high school
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.600]   and I'm 36 now, so it's like a long time.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.380]   So it's really cool.
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.400]   We never ever had a seat next to Z.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.600]   We had seats before because there were only like 20 people
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.960]   and we have like four kids,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.620]   but it's really crazy that we have this now.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.260]   And he's in that bathroom a long time.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.740]   (chatter)
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.900]   (chatter)
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.060]   (chatter)
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.220]   (chatter)
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.380]   (chatter)
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.560]   (chatter)
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.720]   (chatter)
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.880]   (chatter)
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.040]   (chatter)
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.200]   (chatter)
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.360]   (chatter)
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.520]   (chatter)
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.680]   (chatter)
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.840]   (chatter)
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.000]   (chatter)
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.160]   (chatter)
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.400]   (chatter)
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.560]   (chatter)
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.720]   (chatter)
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.880]   (chatter)
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.040]   (chatter)
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.200]   (chatter)
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.360]   (chatter)
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:53.120]   (laughter)
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:08.160]   - I'm Jenni, I'm married to Brian,
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.740]   and I have one child, his name is Uriah,
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.260]   and he is in the Feeds magazine.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:29.420]   - I said I've been here for like a really long time.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.640]   - I remember when I first came, you were in overalls.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.160]   (laughter)
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.840]   Well I'm not saying that she was like that young,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.680]   but she was literally in overalls.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.940]   (laughter)
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.100]   And it's all coming back.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:59.280]   - I started coming, like fresh things,
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.780]   not from during the holidays.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.700]   So I was 19, that was a long time.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.780]   (laughter)
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.940]   (chatter)
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.100]   (chatter)
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.260]   (chatter)
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:40.660]   - Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you so much
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.160]   for the privilege of being able to serve
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.740]   the body of the brain, or dying.
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.220]   Really having a heart for our children,
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.980]   a desire, Lord, to see them grow,
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.900]   to come to this state of knowledge,
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.320]   and what your son did in our birth in particular.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.060]   God, I pray that that will resonate with us
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.320]   more on a daily basis, God, that will shape
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.480]   who we are, and shape how we are doing ourselves.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.560]   Our trajectory, really, for the rest of our lives.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.000]   I pray that that would shape us, Lord,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.120]   in our service to our church.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.800]   Lord, that you would help it to be grounded
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.240]   in you and in your work.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.200]   And Lord, I pray that as we cover safety,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.760]   Lord, oftentimes it can seem like a logistical matter,
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.460]   but I pray, Lord, that you would help us, Lord,
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.920]   to really convey with the Spirit why we go over
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.800]   these principles, Lord, and how we desire
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.720]   to serve the body best, Lord, by instituting
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.920]   these policies, God.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.240]   I pray that you would help us, Lord,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.000]   to be a blessing to our church, Lord,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   in making sure that these policies are held
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.520]   and adhered to.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.720]   And I pray, God, for all of the people here
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.400]   in this room who have hearts of service,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.080]   or that they desire to be rendered in you.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.260]   I pray that they would continue to walk low
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.500]   in you, God, that they would really do their best,
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.020]   Lord, in their walks, God, and to be intimate
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.660]   in hellish in you, so that that would bleed
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.460]   through their service, God, that the children
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.180]   would be able to see who they are, Lord,
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.700]   and how they desire the Lord to emulate them
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.540]   in whatever way.
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.620]   So, would you be with Val and yourself today
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.420]   as we present this, God, to them?
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.500]   I pray that you would be with us in Jesus' name.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.200]   So, first, we just wanna thank all of you guys
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.600]   for coming, and we will try and get through it
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.280]   as quickly as we can, okay?
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.760]   The first thing we really wanna go through
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.280]   is just the stewardship of children,
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.840]   and all of us as volunteers have a particular
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.920]   responsibility for these kids.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.820]   And, I mean, we have kids, but we really see them
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.100]   as gifts that God has entrusted to us,
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.300]   and we entrust those most precious gifts
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.700]   to you guys, who are volunteering with them,
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.420]   or maybe watching them.
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.900]   And so, it's really a ministry.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.740]   The goal of having these children
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.060]   is that they would know Christ.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.460]   That is the end goal for us as parents,
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.160]   and we hope that that is the end goal
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.680]   for you guys as volunteers,
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.720]   is that you would love our children
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.480]   just as Christ loves our children,
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.240]   just as we love our children,
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.160]   and that it's really setting an example for them
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.120]   of just being a Christian,
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.120]   of what a genuine Christian looks like,
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.600]   and whether that's playing with them,
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.160]   whether that's teaching them,
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.340]   and whatever context that you are,
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.920]   that is our goal, is that they would see Christ
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.540]   in genuine faith in each one of us.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.660]   So that means it's not just like
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.020]   you're just babysitting them,
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.340]   but there is an overarching purpose
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.500]   as to why you're there.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.660]   So it's ministering to the children, praying for them,
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.460]   supporting and encouraging us as parents,
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.260]   who are primarily responsible for their discipleship.
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.180]   So ultimately, it is our responsibility as parents,
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.500]   and you guys are really coming alongside
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.340]   and helping us in that goal,
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.540]   and so we really do appreciate that as parents.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.980]   We hope that you don't ever feel like
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.380]   we just take babysitters or anyone
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.060]   who's working with our children for granted,
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.520]   but that is such an important thing for us as parents,
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.660]   to entrust you with them,
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.620]   and that is something we're working together for.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.060]   And really seeing our children as worshipers
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.660]   with an eternal destiny, either heaven or hell,
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.680]   and that they are souls to be cared for,
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.500]   and that in the end, we want them to know Christ,
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.300]   we want them to be saved.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.460]   So just really having that kind of perspective
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.780]   going into whatever service that you may have
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.820]   with our children, just want to put that on there first.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:11.020]   Okay, so there are a lot of procedures
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.140]   that we're putting into place,
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.740]   just because there are just so many people
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.660]   that are volunteering.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.880]   Like I'm looking at you guys,
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.100]   and I really don't know most of you guys,
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.460]   and you guys are the ones who are watching our kids.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.940]   So in one sense, as a parent, that's really scary,
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.340]   because you guys are the ones interacting with them,
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.860]   but I don't know who you are.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.500]   And so we're trying to put these procedures in place
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.700]   just to make things safer,
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.900]   just so that we know at least people are members,
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.780]   people know what kind of safety procedures
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.520]   across the board as a church that we have.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.700]   So the basic general screening procedures,
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.180]   there are two types now.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.380]   If you are a general, like one-time special events,
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.180]   which includes like one-day conferences,
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.220]   or our retreats, or VBS, family ministry events,
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.220]   Reformation Night, Bible study, babysitting,
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.740]   things like that, it's like one time,
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.220]   you're not doing it consistently,
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.140]   like seeds or sprouts or your staff number,
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.840]   then this is the general procedure now.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.620]   You have to be a church member for at least one year,
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.000]   you have to fill out that general application
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.620]   that is online, and you have to attend the safety training,
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.780]   which we're still deciding how often you have to retake that
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.940]   but somewhere between three to five years.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:32.260]   And the process is different than if you are a current
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.700]   SO staff teacher or volunteer, like in the ministry.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.140]   So if you happen to already gone through the process
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.120]   of being a SO, like teacher or volunteer,
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.860]   then this is probably like,
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.300]   you were definitely already like in, right?
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.200]   But if you were the other way,
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.280]   it doesn't work the other way.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.000]   So you would have to go through a more rigorous process.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.920]   And that would be, you have to fill out, oh, oh, oh, okay.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.080]   And this is just for in general,
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.060]   like there are kids, like youth group volunteers
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.080]   that will happen to join at certain times.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.200]   So you as a volunteer should know, okay,
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.400]   if I happen to be like babysitting,
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.280]   and I know that this person is babysitting with me,
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.880]   either they are a church member,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.260]   they have to have followed all those previous requirements.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.940]   And if you know they haven't,
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.220]   they should not be with the kids, okay?
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.380]   So you cannot recruit them to babysit for Bible study
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.340]   or whatever it may be,
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.380]   unless you know that they meet these three requirements.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:38.140]   And if you're not sure, then you should ask Pastor Mark,
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.620]   you can ask Jane now, you can ask me, you can ask Jen and I,
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.340]   because they have to have these requirements
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.120]   where they are not allowed to babysit children,
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.240]   they cannot be volunteering.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:54.760]   The same goes for youth and youth group volunteers,
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.840]   and they have to fill out a permission form
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.760]   by their parents, and then they have to be supervised
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.320]   by an adult at all times.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.400]   So if you have a youth group volunteer with you
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.740]   at Reformation Night or at BDS,
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.640]   they have to be with an adult.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.660]   They can't be just by themselves.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.440]   And especially for junior high or children junior high,
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.440]   they should have a parent with them.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.440]   And they cannot have any kind of supervisory role,
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.520]   and they can't take any minors to the bathroom.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.040]   So just so that you know that
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.640]   if you happen to be in that situation,
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.160]   and you're like, oh, they're in my team,
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.040]   like for food team, or they're in my team
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.000]   for like, we're playing a game,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.640]   and they're like, oh, I'm gonna take this kid
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.760]   to the bathroom, they're not allowed to, okay?
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.260]   So just so that you know that.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.740]   Then if you ever wanna become part of the SO staff,
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.140]   teacher, TA, or volunteers, you have to be a church member
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.380]   for one year, if they have a more rigorous application.
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.940]   You have to fill out a background authorization
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.420]   or reference check form, and have,
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.340]   and Officer Joe does all of the reference check,
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.700]   background checks, and he keeps them very safe
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.100]   and very secure, 'cause he's an officer.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.820]   And there's a safety training,
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.540]   and there's CPR training for any nursery leads
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.020]   in any of the three areas.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.940]   They also have to renew their commitment every year,
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.140]   update their application,
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.260]   and re-sign the background authorization form,
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.000]   so that if at any time we feel like there's something weird,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.200]   that we can back her up.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.660]   Okay, so that's just a final thing.
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.020]   And just for your personal, you know, peace of mind,
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.420]   all information is confidential, nothing is disclosed.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.980]   Nobody knows what's on those,
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.980]   except for who needs to know those things,
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.100]   and usually, unless Officer Joe sees something like that,
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.460]   like, okay, this is a concern,
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.980]   then he will tell the proper pastor or leader to,
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.940]   you know, to do their own care.
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.220]   Okay, so I'm gonna go into the children's health
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.060]   and background form.
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.260]   So this is a form, or a questionnaire,
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:11.260]   that we have all students within our ministry,
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.100]   within our SOAR ministries, right,
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.500]   that's seeds, sprouts, and vines, fill out.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.620]   And it must be filled out either electronically
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.820]   or in paper form, okay?
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.060]   I think for seeds, we have it all in Google Docs.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.420]   Well, we transitioned to that right now.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.060]   So the only times that we have it in paper form
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.940]   for our students now is if they're a newcomer
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.820]   or they're just a one-time visitor.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.260]   And so that's how we keep them now.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.220]   Now, it's really important that we know
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.660]   what's in these forms specific.
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.940]   I know, at least to our ministry,
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.980]   a little bit more stringently than others,
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.380]   because we need to know, okay,
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.420]   do they have any kind of allergies, right,
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.060]   food restrictions that are tied to that,
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.300]   any type of medical conditions, you know,
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.180]   that they may have where they can't, you know,
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.020]   play on the ground, they might get in their head,
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.540]   it's not good for them.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.460]   You know, any kind of diaper preferences,
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.740]   you know, or bathroom preferences.
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.900]   Some parents will not let our volunteers
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.500]   take their child to the bathroom, and that's okay,
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.500]   because that is their preference.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.460]   You know, we want to respect that.
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.020]   We can have their contact info if we should.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.540]   We need to let them know, you know, about an emergency
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.820]   or anything that might have cropped up
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.300]   that they would probably want to know about.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.900]   And we want to also make sure that
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.060]   if there's any discipline issues,
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.540]   some parents like to deal with the discipline directly
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.300]   rather than have a teacher or one of our volunteers
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.340]   to do that, and that's perfectly fine.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.380]   You know, each family has their way of, you know,
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.940]   raising their children, we want to respect that.
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.180]   So it's really important, and you're gonna hear me say,
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.900]   if you guys are volunteering for seats,
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.260]   you'll hear me say all the time,
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.820]   check the sticker on the back, does it say it's okay?
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.620]   Did you check to see if there's any type of allergy to meat
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.980]   or egg or peanut butter, all those things.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.260]   We keep all that in mind,
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.740]   even when they sit down at snack time,
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.300]   so they're away from people that might have
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.300]   a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, right?
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.940]   'Cause some parents don't know, right?
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:01.420]   And then that happens, so something to consider.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.940]   - And something, if you're babysitting,
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.020]   'cause I know there's a lot of people
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.700]   who are babysitting this time around,
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.780]   if you're there, you should probably ask the parents
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.780]   or whoever to have them pack their own snack,
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.420]   or have someone post on their Facebook
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.300]   to pack their own snack so that you don't have any issues
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.100]   with this, like, allergy, like, what they can or can't eat,
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.980]   just like, each child has their own, like, stuff.
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:28.700]   - So arrival and departure procedures
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.060]   for our seats ministry, which is our nursery ministry,
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.180]   we have everything by electronic stickers,
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.900]   so whenever you see the kids come in,
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.020]   or you see the kids running around,
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.020]   sometimes they'll have this big white sticker on the back,
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.660]   right, that's impossible to take off.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.700]   I know parents have told me they've laundered it,
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.940]   and it's like forever, per box, stickers, right?
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.580]   But we have that for them, and then Sprouts,
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.180]   they actually have to physically sign in,
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.980]   their children have to sign their children out as well.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.100]   We do make sure that we check to ensure
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.140]   that we have that information,
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.140]   Sarah is really vigilant about making sure
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.660]   if there are any parents that have been coming out
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.220]   for a while and we haven't filled that out,
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.580]   we need to make sure that that's filled out
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.580]   so we know how to care for the child.
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.900]   It's also important that children are only released, right?
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.420]   On the sticker you'll see at the absolute bottom,
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.540]   and you'll see on the sign in and out sheet for Sprouts,
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.980]   who the child can be released to.
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.260]   So we're pretty hyper-vigilant about that,
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.100]   I think the only time we allow our leader
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.180]   to take them to their parent is if it's taking
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.460]   a really long time, we don't know what's going on,
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.100]   and it's only the head person,
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.180]   so it would either be Melissa Long, or it would be Sarah
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.620]   that would take the child directly to their parent
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.980]   if something should happen.
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.060]   A security camera, so in case you guys don't know,
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.220]   we have security cameras in the main sanctuary,
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.380]   we have them, one's right behind you,
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.660]   we have them recording 24/7 in our church,
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.380]   because this kind of came from our old office
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.380]   that pretty much had an open door all the time,
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.900]   and then we found that there were some people
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:55.900]   that weren't attending their trip
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.940]   that were coming in to use our restroom, right?
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.660]   And then suddenly certain things would go missing,
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.940]   so we put those in place just to make sure
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.900]   there wasn't any kind of vandalism or theft,
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.620]   but also mainly for the safety and security
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:07.620]   of our children, right?
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.060]   So you'll see them in the main sanctuary
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.180]   and also in the ministry areas.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:16.580]   And then the healthy childhood policies,
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.380]   so we have this posted actually at the front
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.980]   of each ministry welcome area,
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.980]   and we do that just to notify parents
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.520]   that should you see that your child is sick,
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.820]   that we will let them know,
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.340]   or just to abide by that policy in general.
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.460]   So we always say, we wanna make sure
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.780]   that we let them know,
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.220]   because sometimes they have a lot of kids,
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.140]   and they may not always know the exact health condition
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.100]   of each child they have, right?
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.260]   So sometimes, I know for us in SEEDS at least,
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.620]   we'll see a child that has really bad runny nose,
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.180]   and we're not sure, but we check with the parent
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.420]   and we'll text them or we'll call them,
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.140]   be like, "Hey, do you know if they're okay?"
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.140]   Sometimes they have no idea,
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.340]   or they just pop a fever in SEEDS.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.280]   That's happened.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.040]   Or suddenly their kid is laying on the floor napping,
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.400]   and then we realize later they had hand, foot, mouth, right?
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.160]   And so this stuff happens, right?
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.200]   We don't know what they interact with outside
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.000]   in their environment when they're in the playground,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.520]   or when they're interacting at daycare,
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.560]   or whatever might be the case.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.040]   So that's stuff that we want you to look out for,
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.160]   and we want you to be able,
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.720]   not to feel like you can't tell the parent,
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.920]   'cause you don't wanna disturb their worship.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.880]   There's that element too,
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.240]   but they're also gonna wanna know if their child's sick.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.680]   They're gonna be like, "I have to worship.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.380]   "Please tell me my child's sick later."
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.040]   They're gonna wanna know that.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.900]   So it's really important that you keep an ear out for that,
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.580]   that you have an eye out,
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.780]   and that you inform the parents as soon as possible.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.500]   - Yeah, and you want to make sure
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.820]   if there is like, really like they're sick,
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.620]   like whatever context you're in, babysitting, whatever,
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.060]   and you see if it is sick,
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.100]   you need to tell the parent,
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.700]   because you don't want to infect everyone else that's there.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.820]   And so it's like really gross.
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.760]   (laughing)
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.600]   Right, so.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.400]   - 'Cause we have 60 kids in nurseries,
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.060]   so when you infect one, right, it spreads like wildfire.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:06.400]   - So the two caregiver rule.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.000]   This is a very important one, okay?
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.120]   It means that at least two qualified adult caregivers
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.120]   should be present in each classroom,
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.560]   studying, whatever it may be, at all times.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.560]   And this consists of one male and one female,
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.860]   or two females.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.240]   It is never two males, ever.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.020]   It is never one male.
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.680]   It is always two people,
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.720]   one male and one female, or two females, okay?
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.600]   And we consider adults to be the age of 18 or older.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.640]   Just putting it out there.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.720]   Okay, and this is just because,
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:54.520]   just as a caregiver for your own protection too,
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.680]   that you're not ever alone with a child,
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.480]   and you're giving someone ever reason to question
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.400]   why you're alone with that child.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   So especially if you are babysitting in someone's home,
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.420]   always have two people.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.640]   If you're in Sprouts or Seeds or wherever you are,
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.200]   even if you're just playing with them,
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.800]   don't be alone with them.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   Just always have someone else with you
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   so that they are, it's just safer that way, okay?
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.760]   And then you always have backup too.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.960]   If you don't know what you're doing,
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.520]   or something emergency happens,
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.760]   there's two of you.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.060]   So one can save the child, one can go or get help,
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.640]   or whatever it may be.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.060]   It's just safer in pairs, okay?
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:44.320]   So this also has to do with the restroom procedures,
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.880]   because these are also important.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.640]   So for Seeds, diaper change must be authorized by a parent.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:56.360]   So if a parent did not say that you could change
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.680]   their diaper, you cannot change their diaper
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.000]   without asking their approval,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.960]   or if I'm saying, "Here, change my diaper,"
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.040]   you need to make sure that they've authorized it.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.480]   For Sprouts, for older kids that are kindergarten age
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.000]   or older, who can go to the bathroom,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.280]   they can go to the bathroom by themselves,
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.200]   they can pull their pants down and all that stuff,
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.200]   it's one female or one male can take them,
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.720]   but you have to leave the door open, like a jar.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.040]   So you can't just be in the bathroom closed,
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.560]   so if you're in this bathroom, the door has to be ajar.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.520]   They can go and use the restroom by themselves,
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.800]   but the door has to be slightly open.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.680]   And again, you have to have authorization from the parent.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.080]   If they need help, you have to have gotten permission
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.320]   in order to do that.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.360]   And if they didn't, then you need to go and call
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.200]   that parent to come and assist their child.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.320]   Youth group students, again, do not take children
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.160]   to the bathroom.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:59.520]   Okay, so use of seeds and sprouts bathrooms.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.240]   In each area, there are seeds and sprouts,
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.120]   there are bathrooms specifically designated
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.480]   for seeds and sprouts.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.840]   Male volunteers and teachers are not allowed
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.960]   to use those bathrooms while sew is in session.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.920]   So I think there's like signs around here,
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.840]   so it's between like 10 or something.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.800]   No male volunteers are allowed to be using that.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.640]   You have to use the sanctuary or upstairs bathroom,
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.400]   upstairs cafe bathrooms.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.680]   And non-sprouts adults, so like even me as a parent,
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.400]   are should not be using those bathrooms, okay?
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.320]   So if you see a parent wandering in here,
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.960]   like, "Oh, I gotta go pee," just run to the other bathroom.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.200]   They're not allowed to be in here.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.680]   All right, so I'll go ahead and go over the accidents
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.280]   that might happen within the ministry.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.880]   Sometimes there's injuries that occur.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.120]   Some kids get a little bit feisty
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.520]   and they start running around
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.680]   and then they bump into each other's heads, right,
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.320]   when they're running around the room.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.520]   This has happened, you know?
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.800]   And so any type of injury, no matter how minor or major,
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.200]   we always wanna make sure that we have
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.960]   an injury report form filled out, okay?
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.040]   You'll find that in the binder,
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.120]   and if you don't know where that is,
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.600]   you can go ahead and talk to the lead within your ministry
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.960]   and they'll go ahead and direct you to that form.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.840]   We always make sure that we fill that out in its entirety
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.440]   and we give a copy to the parents
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.040]   so that they're aware of the situation
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.280]   and we keep a copy for our ministry.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.760]   And we do that because you never know
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.920]   what could happen from two people colliding, right?
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.960]   I've had kids collide and then it turns into
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.640]   a worse issue later, or I think I've actually,
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.840]   I'm not gonna spout this, I think, like,
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.400]   you know, I've had a couple of cousins
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.280]   collide and one of their teeth, like,
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.160]   hit their other cousin's head, right?
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.920]   And it was, like, really, like, frightening for me, you know?
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.160]   So you wanna make sure that you let the parents know
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.360]   right away, right, because they need to go and seek treatment
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.280]   for their kid's mouth or for the head, you know,
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.580]   if it got hit really hard.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:55.080]   Even with, you know, little things, minor things,
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.600]   you don't know if it'll grow to bigger things,
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.440]   so it's really important.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.080]   Now, if they have, like, this little cut
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.640]   and they're like, oh, I need a band-aid,
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.400]   I don't want you to write a major report for that, okay?
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.920]   They might have already had that, right?
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.800]   But if it's something that happens within our ministry,
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.000]   and, you know, we need to let the parents know
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.800]   and just make sure that parents know.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.680]   Okay, so going over first aid and emergency procedures.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.720]   So if you don't know where the first aid kit is located,
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.680]   make sure that you ask your ministry leader,
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.800]   because each ministry has it somewhere within that room
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   or within that space, okay?
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.640]   It's important for cuts, or not for cuts, I'm sorry,
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.520]   for cuts or anything that requires any type of first aid,
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.880]   so make sure that you know where that is.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.800]   And we also have emergency procedures posted
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.000]   in every, I think at the front of every ministry area.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.160]   So if you don't know where that is,
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.160]   make sure you take a look at that
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.240]   'cause it really varies yourself with that as well.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.800]   And we have an AED, actually, for people who don't know,
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.240]   we have a defibrillator.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.920]   In our church, it is actually,
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.200]   right when you enter into the main sanctuary
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.600]   and you see that table right in front of you,
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.200]   and you turn and there's that drink stand
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.760]   that everyone puts their drinks on, right?
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.360]   The AED is right next to it.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.600]   It's a big, it's not big, actually.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.880]   - Yeah, it's like a red box. - It's kind of a small,
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.040]   red box. - Yeah.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.920]   - And so if you ever need to use a,
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.440]   you need the AED defibrillator,
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.960]   you can go ahead and get it off that wall there, okay?
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.400]   All right, so church boundaries.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.160]   So in general, just so you guys kind of know
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.320]   where kids are not, where kids are and are not allowed,
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.920]   they are not supposed to be in the kitchen at any time
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.000]   because we've got knives in there,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.120]   we've got sharp objects that we don't want them
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.680]   interacting with, right?
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.560]   Kitchen or alleyways because we don't have
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.040]   a lot of visibility there, right?
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.200]   They should not be in those areas.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.760]   We want them to stay within the building
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.480]   as much as possible, whether that's at the cafe area
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.160]   or any type of general area where there's a lot of people,
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.040]   especially you, right, as a parent,
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.360]   if you are a parent, right?
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.160]   It's important that you're there.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.160]   It's really important that if you are going to have
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.600]   your child's piece of playground that you make sure
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.360]   that they are being monitored by an adult,
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.560]   whether it's a friend of yours or yourself,
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.800]   make sure that you have an adult there with them.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.000]   We absolutely do not want children riding in vehicles,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.400]   and we'll get to that in a bit with the field trips
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.920]   and the liability form in the next slide,
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.520]   but make sure that they are not riding in your vehicles,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.880]   especially alone with you, okay?
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.960]   And make sure that you're staying in view of people
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.380]   at all times, like you said, that two-caregiver rule,
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.680]   that should be something that if I know that I'm alone
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.800]   with the child, even though I've been at church forever,
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.640]   right, I want the accountability just like I want
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.240]   the accountability for everybody else, right?
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.640]   So first thing I do is I make sure that another person
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.320]   knows I'm either in there or with me,
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.320]   and then I notify the parent, hey, I'm here with your child,
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.760]   'cause there are times when I come into a room
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.720]   and I'm like, oh my gosh, you're young, right?
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.560]   And where's your mom, right?
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.920]   And that happens 'cause the kids love open space, right?
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.520]   They will go, right, where they can go,
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.960]   so make sure that you always stay in view of people
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.440]   and don't leave them unattended,
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.480]   make sure you notify their parent right away.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.420]   - Yeah, and right now, it's like there's a lot of kids
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.200]   like running throughout the building,
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.960]   sometimes they're out like right in front of here,
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.700]   so if you just happen to see a kid by themselves,
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.420]   like just as a, you know, helpful adult around,
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.480]   like ask them where their mom and dad are
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.440]   and try to return them back to their parents,
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.320]   because ultimately, it is responsibility of parents
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.400]   to keep track of their children,
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:13.040]   but the reality is that they are oftentimes
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.480]   running around by themselves, but they shouldn't be, okay?
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:21.480]   So just, I guess, help them out, help us out, and yes.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.600]   - Well, for the seats, kids, I've asked the parents
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.200]   to leave their stickers on their back
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.440]   so that when they're running around,
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.160]   if you don't know who their parent is,
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.000]   their phone numbers are on that sticker,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.400]   so you can text the parents.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.240]   - Okay.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:38.080]   All right, and last thing I wanna go over is field trips,
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.560]   all right, in general libraries.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.320]   So field trip waivers must be completed
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.320]   before any child or student, specifically,
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.920]   are allowed to go on any type of excursions,
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.800]   and especially if they're gonna ride in any vehicle,
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.360]   stand in place for a trip to them, okay?
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.680]   We definitely ask for you to use caution
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.040]   when giving students car rides.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.800]   I always say make sure you have authorization
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.600]   and permission from their parent, you know,
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.200]   or at least notify them, let them know,
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.800]   hey, these people are riding in my car.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.800]   I think it's really important
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.400]   that we keep ourselves accountable to that.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.680]   Do not, try your best, I know emergencies arise, right,
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.120]   try your best not to be alone with a student in the car,
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.840]   because that is something that we don't want to have happen.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.240]   Like, instead of the caregiver role,
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.280]   make sure that we have that accountability,
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.440]   or if you're the driver,
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.400]   that there's a group of students with you,
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.080]   there's none of this one-on-one interaction, okay?
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.640]   And then also make sure that, you know,
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.080]   one thing that we require is that
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.200]   you prove liability for an assignment
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.680]   and we want them to not be put on these rides.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:41.120]   - Okay, so character and conduct.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.320]   All right, so we kind of touched upon this in the beginning,
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.000]   but, so there's that kind of character and conduct,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.080]   but there's also just, you know,
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.880]   general conduct with kids.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.120]   All teachers and volunteers
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.960]   must wear their name tags while serving.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.000]   So this is within, like, on church on Sunday.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.960]   You'll notice that this SO ministry has orange name tags,
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.080]   and that's to identify that they are serving,
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.720]   that they're supposed to be there.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.920]   And so if you are serving within one of these ministries,
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.600]   you should always be wearing your name tag while you're there.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.160]   Use appropriate language and discipline with the kids.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.320]   Again, the whole point of this is
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.840]   we are trying to show, you know,
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.920]   the love of Christ to them,
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.880]   and, you know, there are times when they are not behaving,
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.840]   they are, you know, sinful children to,
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.920]   you know, they're gonna be fighting,
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.160]   or they might talk back, they might do something,
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.680]   you know, whatever it may be.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.680]   But we're not yelling or speaking harshly,
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.360]   and just really explain to them
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.800]   why they're being disciplined,
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   exemplify forgiveness, and to just pray for them,
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.760]   and really use that as a ministry opportunity to,
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.360]   you know, just talk about, you know,
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.360]   and then, like, sharing the gospel with them.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.160]   There's many times when, you know,
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.080]   my kids have, like, done something,
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.320]   fighting over something really lame,
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.040]   and then, you know, it's a really good time
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.200]   just to talk about, you know,
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.920]   selfishness, or pride, or just, you know,
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.240]   loving someone else, and those kinds of things.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:12.200]   So, really use those things as opportunities for ministry.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.560]   And, again, like, just politely ask all non-volunteers
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.920]   to remain outside of ministry rooms during service,
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.880]   which a lot of times happens that people wanna come in
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.120]   because they're like, "The cute kids,
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.040]   "and I wanna play with them,
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.800]   "and I know that one," or, you know, whatever it may be,
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.160]   but they are not allowed in these rooms
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.680]   while the ministry is happening,
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.160]   or going on during service,
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.320]   so just tell them they can go play with them.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.160]   Okay.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:46.280]   All right, so I wanna go into the thing
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.280]   that no one ever wants to talk about, but it happens,
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.040]   and I'm just going to preface this with the fact that,
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:55.440]   you know, all of the things that we have in place
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.480]   are in place for a purpose,
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:01.760]   but we cannot perfectly protect our kids from everything.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.640]   They will get hurt, and things will happen.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.960]   That's all under God's sovereignty,
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.440]   but all the things that do happen that are bad,
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.200]   and evil in the world, they are a result of our sin,
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.720]   and they do happen.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.880]   I really like this quote.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.480]   I was reading this book called
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.640]   On Guard, Preventing and Responding to Child Abuse at Church,
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.560]   and it's by Pastor Deepan Briju
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.560]   from Capitol Hill Baptist Church.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.720]   And it says, "Keep in mind, though,
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.440]   "that no adult can perfectly protect their kids
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.320]   "from evil in this fallen world.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.200]   "Even homeschoolers who spend the majority
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.640]   "of their time at home or at church
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.400]   "can't avoid the long tentacles of the internet
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.920]   "and social media that reach beyond the walls of our homes
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.600]   "and into our children's lives.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.280]   "The sad reality is that no matter how careful we are,
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.480]   "some of our children will be abused,
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.160]   "and it will likely happen right under our noses.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.920]   "We'll be fooled, and we'll hate the fact
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.280]   "that we were not with it enough to catch the perpetrator
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.360]   "before he or she did harm.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.720]   "A realistic perspective on life in a fallen world
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.520]   "is not that we can perfectly protect our kids,
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.800]   "but that with wisdom, carefulness, and planning,
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.600]   "we can reduce the risk."
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.160]   And that's really why if we're doing what we can,
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.880]   we can put all these procedures in place,
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.920]   we can put policies, but if things will happen
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.960]   that are out of our control.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.360]   And so, just putting that out there
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.600]   before we talk about inappropriate relationships
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.880]   with students, it does happen,
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.280]   and in our church history, this has happened.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:32.240]   And so, I'm putting it out there
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.720]   that if you are working with youth group kids,
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:39.240]   if they're older and you can have deeper conversations
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.600]   with them, but they are still children, they are not adults,
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.680]   and your goal as a person who's working in ministry
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.000]   with them is not to create this deep relationship
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.560]   with them necessarily, but it is to be a minister,
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.040]   to be a teacher, to be a light to them,
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.840]   and so not to abuse that kind of relationship.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.400]   And again, the whole thing is not to be alone
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.240]   and create environments where possible things could happen,
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.720]   so have another adult with you,
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.880]   just like as Jennai said, as an accountability.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.660]   Always touch appropriately.
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.720]   Teachers, volunteers may not request a child
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.440]   to remove garments other than jackets or shoes.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.000]   Physical affection such as hugs or kisses
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.920]   do not solicit them from the kids,
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.840]   even though a lot of times we do,
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.280]   because we may know their family or their parents,
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.480]   but within the context of the church setting
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:41.100]   and you are caring for them as a caregiver in the church,
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.440]   refrain from doing that, 'cause then other workers
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.960]   or people, volunteers, might think,
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.560]   "Hey, that's okay, I can do that too,
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.680]   "because she's doing that or he's doing that,"
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.380]   but really, within this context,
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.480]   we should not be doing that, so don't ask for hugs,
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.700]   don't ask for kisses, and don't ask for them
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.160]   to sit in your lap unless they just,
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.520]   really don't want to be back into you
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.400]   and they sit on your lap,
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.240]   which is a lot of times that happens.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.000]   Or even piggyback rides or wrestling,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.560]   which is what a lot of kids seven through 10,
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.000]   "No wrestling, I'm gonna wrestle you,"
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   but just refrain from those kinds of things,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.480]   if possible, within this environment.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.200]   If you think it's okay and their parent's okay
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.560]   with that outside of it, then sure, okay,
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.200]   be cautious and wise about it,
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.160]   but within this context of church,
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.600]   just refrain from that.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:38.480]   Reporting inappropriate behavior or abuse.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.480]   So, on one end, it's possible that as caregivers,
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:48.360]   people can possibly use that role in that relationship,
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.000]   and I'm saying, we're putting this out there
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.520]   'cause it happens, if you Google search,
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.680]   like right now, church molestation,
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.280]   there's a bunch that just happened.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.000]   Saddleback Church, it just happened a few months ago,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.720]   like their youth pastors and volunteers.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:09.240]   The same procedures that I based all the things on
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.040]   for Rock Harbor, a pastor there
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.720]   was molesting children at that church,
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.520]   and that was like five years ago.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:21.440]   It happens, and it's sad, and that's the reality of it,
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.640]   and so I'm just putting that out there
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.960]   because it does happen, and I don't want us
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.640]   to be unaware and caught off guard
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.200]   'cause a lot of people prey on the fact
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.680]   that in churches, we trust one another,
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.040]   and that's a good thing, but we don't,
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.840]   yeah, I don't know, you don't understand, okay.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.280]   So, I don't want it to be like we create this environment
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.840]   where we're like always questioning, oh, this could be,
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.560]   but I don't want us to be naive either
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.920]   that it doesn't happen, okay,
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:52.000]   and that it could happen not only from other people,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.800]   but even in people's own homes, okay.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   So, any behavior that indicates that a child
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   may be inclined, or any, that someone is inclined
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.880]   to abuse, molest, or otherwise harm any child,
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.520]   especially when under the care of the church,
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.600]   or any indication that a child under the care of the church
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:18.280]   is being abused, molested, neglected, or harmed by someone,
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.640]   first see if that seems like innocent, okay.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.000]   Just, you know, just might be inappropriate,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.680]   but they don't know, so just privately, you know,
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.080]   talk to the person, encourage them,
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.080]   hey, remember that safety training, you know,
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.880]   we went to, like, not to be alone, or not to, you know,
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.280]   just, you know, just out of love, out of just, you know,
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.160]   care for that person, you know, you can approach them,
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.320]   and if you continue to see, perhaps, a pattern of behavior,
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.560]   then, and there's reasonable suspicion,
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.160]   then report it to the appropriate lead,
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.160]   like Sarah, or Mel, or Pastor Mark, or Matt,
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:58.200]   or just, you know, an appropriate pastor
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.520]   that you think that you can trust with that information,
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:02.360]   and what to do.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:11.360]   All right, so special restrictions.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.400]   All right, these are just special instructions
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.000]   for, like, if you're working for BBS, or Reformation Night,
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.800]   especially Reformation Night is coming up,
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.200]   like, these kids are crazy,
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.520]   they're, like, running around, like, everywhere,
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.120]   so students should always be supervised,
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.400]   and they shouldn't be, like, running around outside,
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.600]   or anywhere in the building, like, by the playground, too,
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.960]   like, by themselves, so if you see that they are,
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.720]   grab a parent, or, you know, make sure
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.560]   that someone is out there with them,
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.720]   and for Bible study babysitting, which we talked about,
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.800]   if you need a replacement, contact Pastor Mark,
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.040]   and make sure that whoever is replacing you
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.520]   has met the requirements,
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.160]   and if there's just not enough people,
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.680]   I just spoke with the Pastor Mark and the staff,
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.880]   is that the parents of that Bible study group
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:01.640]   need to find, or, like, babysit, okay,
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:05.080]   so if there's only one of you that showed up that day,
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.000]   and you need someone, then you need to tell, like,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.040]   the lead of that group, and tell them,
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.720]   we need somebody, one of you, to be with us
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.920]   while we're babysitting,
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:17.280]   because that's our responsibility as parents, yes, Laura?
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.240]   - Sorry, I have a question,
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.800]   so regarding the Bible study babysitting,
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.480]   is that the responsibility of the host,
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.200]   Bible study host, to ensure that that policy
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.800]   is being followed?
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.760]   - Yeah, so Pastor Peter and Pastor Mark
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.840]   are gonna email all the Bible study leaders,
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.200]   but yes, they can, it's, you know,
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.000]   and whoever, I guess, is, like, kind of leading
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   that Bible study babysitting, like, thing,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.400]   is, like, finding volunteers and stuff like that,
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.280]   like, you should probably coordinate with that person
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.560]   and make sure that they know, yeah.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.560]   Again, keep the two-adult policy,
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.360]   especially for bathrooms,
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.480]   and if there's not, yeah, enough babysitters,
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.840]   ask parents to rotate it.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.840]   And don't ever feel bad about that,
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.960]   because, you know, like, we wanna protect our kids, too,
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.560]   and we don't want it to be, like, also,
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.920]   if you're babysitting, like, such a,
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.920]   like, you're by yourself with, like, 12 kids,
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.440]   which would be, like, terrible.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.880]   That's in, like, one little room.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.720]   So, you know, don't do, don't be like,
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.440]   I'm gonna be a martyr, no, like,
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.680]   do this, but, you know, get another parent in there.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.880]   It's one week, it's okay,
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.440]   put it on a rotation if you have to,
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.480]   but that's our responsibility as parents.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.360]   Um, okay, that was fast, was that good?
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.200]   Okay, good.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:36.880]   Yes!
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.200]   Okay, all right.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.240]   Phew, that was so terrible.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.960]   All right, so basically,
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.720]   there's two things you need to do.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.400]   Make sure you sign it onto that clipboard,
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.560]   and make sure your email address is there,
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.120]   'cause if you did not get this in electronic form,
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.640]   I can send it to you.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:03.640]   And so, give us back the paper copy if you don't want it,
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.760]   but if you really, like, love it,
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.800]   then go ahead and take it home with you,
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.960]   or else just leave it on the side.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.040]   And then the other little slip of paper
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.440]   is the teacher acknowledgement form,
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.960]   so read that and sign it,
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.320]   and then put it back on the table.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.280]   If you don't sign it, that means,
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.080]   and I literally kept all of these from every training,
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.440]   so if you don't sign it, that means, like,
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.160]   I did not know you were here.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.520]   And then you're gonna have to redo this,
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.960]   which you usually don't have to,
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.840]   so, like, for, like, five more years.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.320]   So just make sure you sign it
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.640]   and turn it in on the table before you leave.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:43.640]   And if you have any questions, comments, suggestions
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.280]   on how to improve our safety,
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.040]   like, you guys are there, like,
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.880]   on the front lines doing stuff,
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.440]   so if you see something that we're missing,
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.960]   then let us know, you know,
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.920]   'cause we're always trying to improve.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.320]   We're trying to figure out what we need to do better,
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.520]   so if you have a suggestion or anything,
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.360]   just, like, let us know what we can do to.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.560]   I know for, just to speak to that, too,
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.920]   I feel like, in general, I've noticed
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.320]   our church is not really big on speaking up,
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.240]   but we want you to.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.240]   I know that Sarah and I, we've been able to get
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.640]   a lot of great suggestions from our volunteers
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.240]   and implementing them to great measure,
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.840]   so I really, we really appreciate it,
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.120]   and we want our ministries to get that.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.600]   Okay, so does anyone have any questions?
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.040]   - Yeah, so two child, or not two child,
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.240]   two adult policy to go to the restrooms,
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.840]   so, 'cause in the home groups I've been in so far,
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.000]   they normally have, like, a room where the old kids are
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.640]   and the restroom's outside, so, and so far,
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.400]   when I've done, like, the restroom thing,
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.240]   somebody had to stay in the room with all the kids,
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.960]   while one child had to go out to the restroom,
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.400]   so would you have all the kids follow you
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.240]   to the restroom then?
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.600]   - Well, it's two, so it's one female that can take them.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:51.440]   - Okay.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.920]   - But, so, just basically, never have a male
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.760]   take them by the toes.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.600]   - Okay.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.440]   - Yeah.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.280]   - Yeah.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.440]   - But if it's one male, one female,
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.440]   would the male stay in the room with all the kids?
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.280]   - Um.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   - So what I suggest is just keep all the doors open,
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.920]   so you go to the bathroom and to the room
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.280]   that you guys are babysitting in, just keep it open,
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.000]   because really, what you're helping them to do
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.420]   is put them on the toilet, but you can kinda step back
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.360]   and let them do their thing, but also keep watch in both.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.200]   - Great.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.640]   - Yeah, any other questions?
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.800]   - That's a really good question.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.520]   - So you only, like in here, we only need to leave
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.000]   the door ajar if we're physically going into the bathroom.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   - Yeah, but they can, yes, the kids should know themselves.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.480]   - They can do it by themselves, you just open it.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.320]   - Okay.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.240]   - And Steve's is different, 'cause we keep our bathroom door
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.240]   open at all times, we have a door stopper,
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.120]   so it's open at all times.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.520]   - It's never closed.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.760]   - And our male volunteers have only step in there
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.600]   if they're clean.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.000]   - Poor male volunteers.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.640]   (laughing)
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.640]   - We love you guys.

[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.360]   (laughing)
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.800]   - It's a good thing, 'cause we don't have to
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.640]   open to the bathroom.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.080]   - They do love it, they're like, "Somebody food!"
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.320]   (laughing)
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:08.120]   - One of the little ladies wants to step out.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.120]   - Yeah, any other questions?
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:14.400]   Yeah, do we need to fill out a application for volunteering,

[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.400]   - Oh, maybe I wasn't on that.
