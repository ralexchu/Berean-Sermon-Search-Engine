[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [no audio]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.500]   with the announcements. Okay, if you can please turn your Bibles to Romans chapter 2.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.000]   I'll be reading from verse 2 to verse 4. Okay.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Romans chapter 2 verses 1 through 4. Okay.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   So those of you who are gone in the summer, those collegians, we've been
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   preaching through the, or studying through the Book of Romans.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   So we're only at chapter 2, so you didn't miss a whole lot. But again,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Romans chapter 2 verses 1 through 4. Reading the ESV.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   "Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges, for in passing judgment
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   on another you condemn yourself, because you the judge practice the very
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   same things. We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   practice such things. Do you suppose, O man, you who judge those who practice
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   such things, and yet do them yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Or do you presume on the riches of His kindness, and forbearance, and
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?"
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   You know I forgot one thing, next Sunday we do have a members meeting. That's what I forgot
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   to tell you. So we have a members meeting after the Second Service
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   next week. Okay, I won't read it again, but it's the next Sunday.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And then we have some announcements to make about our church. I mentioned it in the
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   First Service, but I didn't mention the Second Service last week. We are an escrow with our
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   new church facility. It is only about five minutes down the street over
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Red Hill, past Main, left turn. And so there is plenty of room
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   for our children. Our main reason for purchasing, obviously
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   we are starting to outgrow this facility, but our children have already outgrown
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   the facility. So they are busting at the seams over there. And so we
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   found a location that we are an escrow. We found
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   parking. Okay, I'm not going to get into detail. I'll tell you the details
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   at the members meeting. But just to kind of give you a heads up, that's what's going on. And if everything
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   goes well, we're hoping at the latest by May
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   or June next year that we'll be able to move into the new facility. Okay, so
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   please keep that in your prayer. We'll give you updates as things are
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   going along. But again, we are an escrow with that building, just to give you a heads up.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Now let's pray. Alright, so Romans chapter 2.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Heavenly Father, we bless you and thank you Father for this morning.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   We ask Lord God that your word would truly speak to us.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And everything that you've intended in these words through
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   your Holy Spirit would open our eyes and cause us
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   to hear from Christ. That we would deeply fall in love
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   with Him. That our worship to you may be simply a reasonable response
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   considering your great mercy. So we ask Lord
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   God that your Holy Spirit would guide and lead us, convict us, encourage
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and refresh us. In Jesus name we pray, Amen.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   You know this week I was reading an article from Wall Street Journal
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and something really caught my eye. It was interesting, I think related to what we are talking about today.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And instead of butchering it, I'm just going to read what they said.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And please try to pay attention and I hope you grasp
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   what they are saying. A recent study suggests that acetaminophen,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   okay I'm going to butcher that, acetaminophen
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   found in Tylenol. Did I miss something?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   What did I say? Alright.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Oh really? Oh, so you guys know
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   all this already. Acetaminophen.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   How do you guys know all this?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So it's just common. Okay, I'm the fob. Alright. Acetaminophen.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Alright. A recent study suggests that acetaminophen
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   found in Tylenol, Excedrin and a host of other medications
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   is an all purpose damper, stifling range of strong feelings.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Throbbing pain, the sting of rejection, paralyzing, indecision
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   along with euphoria and delight all appear to be taken down a notch
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   by the drug. Did you catch that? They said that the
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   new study found that not only does it help in blocking certain
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   kind of pain, but it also blocks certain kinds of euphoria and delight.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And I was reading this, I thought this was
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   kind of interesting because that kind of
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   describes our generation where everything, every decision that we make
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   a lot of times is to kind of avoid any kind of discomfort or pain and as a result
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   of that we don't experience the joy that comes with life either. Everything has just kind of
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   become mundane. That's true in life, but especially when we're talking
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   about the Gospel of Jesus Christ. If we take
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   the bite out of the Gospel, where we make it
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   palatable to as many people as possible, then you may have more and more people
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   coming through the door, but at the end the punch of the Gospel, the power of the Gospel is taken
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   out. A Gospel that is preached
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   that is more concerned about offending the offender than properly
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   representing the one who has been offended, our Holy God
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   is not the Gospel of the Bible. And it is not the Gospel
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   that has the power to deliver us from our sins.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   A Gospel that only soothes, but it doesn't convict or cut,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   neither brings true joy or victory.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   You know one of the greatest revivals that we see in the Old Testament,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   at least I personally perceive in the Old Testament,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   is not with the Israelites, it's with the Ninevites. Again,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   we can argue as to what was the greatest revival, but remember the story of Jonah.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Jonah is a reluctant prophet of God,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   he runs away from Him, and God basically strikes him, he is swallowed by a
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   whale, he comes back, he repents, and then sends him back into the city.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And a huge revival breaks out because of his preaching.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Now again, you have to remember that this was a reluctant prophet. I'm just going
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   to read this passage for you, and hopefully you can catch my point.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Jonah 3, 3-5, "Now Nineveh was an exceedingly
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   great city, three days journey in breath."
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   I wanted to highlight this, it takes three days to just even cross the city.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   "Jonah began to go into the city, going a day's journey."
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Meaning he's only gone through a third of the city, when
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   he begins to cry out, "Yet forty days Nineveh shall be
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   overthrown." And the people of Nineveh believed God, they called for a fast
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them to the least of them.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   It says because of Jonah's preaching, again
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   he didn't even go through the whole city, it says it was a three days journey, he goes through
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   one third of it, and you would think that there would be an elaborate
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   presentation of what Jonah said. What was it that he said that was so
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   powerful that the whole city would come to repentance and fast, even
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   the king would decree a fast for the whole city. All it
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   says is, he says, "Yet forty days Nineveh shall be overthrown."
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Man, that would be so easy. Right?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   You know, my job would be so easy if all you had to do is, you know, forty
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   days. Can you imagine? Nineveh probably didn't even say this
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   with that kind of excitement because he didn't want to be here. He didn't even want them to hear
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   this because he wanted judgment to come. And simply by warning
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   them. Forty days, judgment is coming and everybody
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   freaks out and they believe him and they end up repenting and revival breaks out, at least for that
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   period. I've always wondered why. What was it
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   about what he said and how he said it that brought this kind of revival? Why did they take
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   him so seriously? My guess is, ok this is not biblical, this is just my guess
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   that maybe some of the people who were on that boat
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   that saw him being thrown out, coming back spit out, and
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   then you know like they saw all this miracle and said, "Man, your God is the real God."
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   That some of these guys came to the city before him
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   and they were telling the story about what this guy's God did and then all of a sudden
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   he comes into town and is like, "Remember that story we were talking about? That's the guy."
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And then he comes in and is like, "Forty days, you're going to die. Forty days,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   you're going to die." He's like, "Oh my gosh, he's serious. I've seen what
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   happened with him." And revival breaks out as a
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   result of that. We look in the book of Acts.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   You know Peter's first preaching in front of the very same
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   people who crucified Jesus. His message in a nutshell
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   is, "You crucified Jesus, who was proven
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   to you by God with signs and wonders, and yet you crucified
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   the Author of life." You would think that people would get offended, "How dare you
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   say this? Do you not know what we did to this Jesus that we can do to you?"
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And I think Peter was expecting probably to be crucified.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Why not? If they can crucify his Master, I mean who is he?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I think he was fully ready to do this.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   But it says in Acts 2.37, it says,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   "Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, 'Brothers, what shall we do?' And Peter said to them,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   of your sins.'" In our generation, the Gospel
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   has been peddled and it's been passed out where people don't understand
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   why it is that we desperately need Christ crucified.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Why we need to constantly remind people over and over again why justification
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   can only be by faith. Because
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   we made the Gospel so palatable to so many people
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   that the bite, that the warning of the wrath of God
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   is not understood. You know,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   in the previous section, Paul goes through details
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   in verse 18 all the way to verse 32 about the sin and why the wrath of God
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   is coming. And so the group that he is talking to in
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   chapter 2, are these groups of people that are looking at this and says,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   "Yeah, you know that's right, these people need judgment.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   They worship in idols. They are practicing all kinds of sexual immorality.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   You know, they are haters of parents, covetous, malice,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   murderers, deceitful people. Of course they need the judgment
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   of God." But what Paul is doing here in chapter 2
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   he is going further than that. Just like if you went to a hospital and
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   you have a wound on your leg and you've kind of bandaged it up. You go to the
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   doctor and the doctor takes a look at it, "Oh, it's just a superficial cut."
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   But he looks at it and says, "This thing goes deeper than that. There may be a broken
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   bone underneath there." So he takes it into the x-ray and he sees
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   not just the surface but deep within. And he needs to examine
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   that to be able to properly assess what the problem is so that they
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   may have to have surgery. They may have to get the bone fixed correctly.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   That's exactly what he is doing in chapter 2. He is examining
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   beyond the surface. Today he is going to be examining
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   these self-righteous people. These are the people who
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   read chapter 1 and it was in full agreement. Of course the judgment
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   of God is coming. And God releases them to their own sins. Of course they
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   need this. And they are sitting there, "Yes, God, go get them."
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   But he is exposing the inner sin of the self-righteous.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   And we are going to be looking at four different things that he says here.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And again some of these points overlap but for the sake of clarity
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   that we can kind of understand what he is saying. He is revealing four separate things
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   about the self-righteous. And why they
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   are also under condemnation. So he begins by saying, "Therefore
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   you have no excuse." Even though you may look at
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   chapter 1 verse 18-32 and say, "You know what? That's not me." But he says,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   "But Paul is saying, 'Yes, it is you.'" Your sin may not look
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   like the pagans of chapter 1, but your sins are just
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   as hideous and you are in just as much need as these people.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   So the first thing, a self-righteous person
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   is always more concerned about the sins of others than their own.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   One, a self-righteous person is always concerned more about the sins
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   of others than their own. Remember
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Luke chapter 18, 1-13, Jesus is giving this parable
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   about this Pharisee and a tax collector who goes up. And this
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   is what the tax collector, this is what the Pharisee, how he prays.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   In verse 11, "The Pharisee standing by himself prayed thus, 'God,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   I thank you that I am not like other men.'"
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   That's the first thing that the Pharisee says, "Thank you God
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   that you didn't make me like these tax collectors, like these other sinners,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   that I am not like these other men, extortioners, unjust,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   adulterers, and even this tax collector.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   that I get." He looks at what he is doing externally and he feels justified
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   before God. And a self-righteous person is
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   always more concerned about the other person. Remember last week we talked
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   about how we have a tendency
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   to get bothered by other people's BO more than ours.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Let me change the illustration to bad breath.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   We are a young church so we are trying to get the illustrations to fit.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I think as an illustrator, it may be crude but I think it will help us understand.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   A self-righteous person is like an individual who just has
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   bad breath and it just stinks and every time you tongue it, like other people notice it but they don't know.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   You know what I mean? But there is
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   only one thing more worse than sitting in front of somebody who just has
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   stinky breath and they don't know and every time they open their mouth they are like, "Oh, you want to say something but you don't want to be
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   crude." What's worse than that is somebody who has bad breath,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   they don't know it but they are disgusted with yours.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   You know, they cringe every time you open your mouth and they let you
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   know it. Your breath stinks!
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And he says, "Oh my gosh!" See, that's
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   the self-righteous person who is absolutely convinced the problem is
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   you. And that's what he says. He begins by saying,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   "Oh man, every one of you who judge, that you are
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   constantly in judgment of other people and you are not aware of where you are
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   with God." We have a tendency
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   again, every time this type of person will always hear a sermon and they are always thinking,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   "That person needed to be here." You know? "My wife
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   needed to hear this. Thank you pastor for this sermon." You know?
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   "Can you do it again next week when I bring my friend? Because they need to hear this."
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   "They need to hear this." "The singles need to hear this." "My husband needs
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   to hear this." It's an individual who is always hearing sermons
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   for the purpose of other people.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   This type of person is dangerous when they know the Bible.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Because the Word of God, instead of being a lamp unto their feet, it becomes a flashlight.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Where they are just constantly. The Word of God is to flash and show
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   you what's wrong with you. So they know the Word of God, but it's always used
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   not to judge the thoughts and intentions of their heart, but to judge
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   the thoughts and intentions of your heart. So he said, "First and foremost,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   a self-righteous person is always preoccupied with
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   other people's sins. Secondly, a
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   self-righteous person believes in the judgment of God.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   They just don't believe that this judgment is for them."
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   In Romans chapter 2, verse 2, it says, "We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   who do such things." So in other words, we're in agreement with this.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   We believe in the judgment of God. Now I know that
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   one of the reasons that when we go out and share the Gospel with people and they say,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   "How can I believe in a God who brings judgment and 9/11 and famine
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   and all this stuff?" I've never met an individual who doesn't
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   believe in justice. Never.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Let me give you an example. If you're driving a car and you're just
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   driving under the speed limit. You're not doing
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   anything crazy, but somebody's ticked off because you're not going fast enough. They come
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   around and they give you the finger. Right? This finger, right?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   They give you the finger and they're ticked off and they cuss you out and they go
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   speeding past you. And then all of a sudden, because he's speeding, there's a cop
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   up ahead and pulls him over. And as you're driving by,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   do you say, "Oh, I feel so bad for that guy." Is that
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   your thought? Karma, right? You say judgment.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Yes, he got what he deserved. Right? You don't
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   come by and say, "I feel so bad for him." You know what I mean? "I wonder,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   you know, he must have been having a hard day." That's not our natural
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   inclination. Right? Something probably more serious than that. Some of you guys
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   may or may not remember OJ Simpson.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   How many of you guys know who OJ Simpson is? Wow.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Okay. I would think everybody would know. But OJ Simpson basically
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   was a superstar football player of my generation.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   He was like the Michael Jordan of football. That's the best way to describe him. Right?
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And so, in 1994,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   in November, he was accused of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Brown, and possibly her boyfriend, Ron Goldman. Both of them were brutally
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   murdered. And they thought, you know, they did some
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   background check and found out that they thought OJ Simpson did it. And it was
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   huge. And I was living in Irvine at that time, and his wife, Bronco,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   that they were chasing, they went past by 5 Freeway, and everybody went out on the
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   bridge to watch him at that time. Well, the trial went on
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   for about a year. And again, you have to imagine, it's like
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   watching Michael Jordan. Like, "Oh, he got accused of murder."
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   And so the whole year, they were going through these things, and they found out, they found
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   traces of his blood in the car. They found the glove
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   that had blood in the back of his house.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   They found a shoe that had the imprint on it.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   And they didn't find the shoe itself, but they found a picture of him wearing that shoe
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   while he was interviewing somebody. And so, all this evidence, anybody who watched
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   the trial, look at it and say, "How can this guy not be guilty?"
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   But after the end, in October 3rd, 1995,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   they came out and said he was innocent.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Yeah, everybody was dumbfounded. How can that be innocent?
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Now, there was a lot of stuff going on at that time. It's kind of like the environment that is today,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   maybe even worse. That LAPD was found to have corruption.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   They were beating people. And there was this hatred toward the cops that was unfair
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   in particular to the African American community. And so,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   they were concerned that if they indict this guy, that there was going to be
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   another riot, and it's going to go crazy and all this stuff. And there was a lot of political things behind it.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   But basically, he got away with murder.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   I don't remember anybody being interviewed saying, like,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   "We live in such a great country that even after you get
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   murdered, you can live free. This is a great country."
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Every single person, "How can a murderer
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   be set free?" And there was a, again,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   everybody lost confidence in the justice system because the justice system was
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   supposed to punish the wicked. I haven't
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   met anybody who doesn't believe that justice needs to be carried out.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   But the problem is, we don't see
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   ourselves in that position. And that's what the self-righteous
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   person is. He says, "You believe in the judgment of God." And rightly
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   falls on people who are like this.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   But they don't believe that that's them. Do you remember John chapter
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   8, 4-7, where Jesus is standing there and a bunch
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   of Jews bring this adulterous woman and basically
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   put him in a trap. She's an adulterous woman. According to
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Old Testament law, you're supposed to stone her. So here's this Jewish rabbi
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   that everybody is praising. Maybe he's the Messiah. And they're going to say, "You know what?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   We're going to put him in a trap. If he says to kill her, he's going to be guilty of murder, according
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   to the Roman law. If he says don't kill her, he's going to be
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   guilty of breaking the Mosaic law. So either way,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   he's going to be in trouble. But Jesus
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   being Jesus, right? They didn't know who they were messing with, right?
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Jesus says, "He who has no sin, let him
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   cast the first stone." You know what's interesting
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   to me? You know what happens. They all drop their stone and they walk away. That until
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   that point, they didn't even think about it.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Until Jesus called them out and says, "Are you in a position
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   to be able to judge her?"
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And for the first time they turned around and said,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   "That's a good answer. That's a good answer." That's the only way he could have gotten
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   out of it. And they turn around and they disappear. See,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   the second thing that he says, a self-righteous person, that they demand justice.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   But it's not for them. It's for those people.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Thirdly, a self-righteous person, ultimately Paul says, is a hypocrite.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Because they practice the same things that they condemn others.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   In verse 1, "In passing judgment on another, you condemn yourself
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   because you the judge practice the very same things." He said, "You do
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   these things." Again in verse 3, "Do you suppose O man, you who judge those
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   who do such things, yet you do the same things that you will escape
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   the judgment of God." Now this person
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   is probably sitting here answering, "What are you talking about? We do the same thing."
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   These guys are idol worshipers. We never worshiped an idol.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   These guys are lustful people committing adultery, all kinds of immoral acts.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   That's not us. In fact, when Paul probably said this
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   and they read this, they were probably thinking to themselves, "Thank God I'm not like these people." Like the tax
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   collector. "Thank God I'm not like these men." But Paul says, "No, you are
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   exactly like them. You do what you accuse them of doing."
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   He said, "By the same judgment that you judge them, you will also
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   be judged." See if you can recognize
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   the hypocrisy of this statement. And I've
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   actually heard people say this and defend this.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And again, this is not to offend you. And I want you to be able to catch
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   the hypocrisy in this, in this generation.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   All white people are racist.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   So you're like, "Oh,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   I hope you caught it. All white people are racist."
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   What's wrong with that statement?
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Your school just started this week, so this is a test.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   All right? All white people
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   are racist. What's wrong with that statement? That statement
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   itself is racist. By saying that,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   you indict yourself. That's a racist statement that you
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   make. I hate judgmental people.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Okay, now you're getting it. All right.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   I can't tolerate anyone who's intolerant.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Okay, you may chuckle, but that's
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   the mantra of our generation, especially the young generation.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Intolerance will not be tolerated.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   The hypocrisy in that statement itself.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   See, a self-righteous person doesn't recognize the hypocrisy in himself.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   He can make these statements, do these things, accuse
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   other sinners of their sin while being completely blind
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   of their own. See, Jesus
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   in Matthew chapter 5 is describing what the character of the
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Kingdom of God, the people of the Kingdom of God is like. And He
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   tells His disciples that your righteousness must exceed that of the
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Pharisees. And this is, I'm not going to read all of it, but this is some of the things that
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   He says. Matthew chapter 5, 21-22, "You have heard that
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   it was said to those of old, 'You shall not murder, and whoever
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   murders will be liable to judgment.' But I say to you that everyone who
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Whoever insults
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   his brother will be liable to the council, and whoever says, 'You fool,'
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   will be liable to the hell of fire."
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Now if you were paying attention to that very closely you would have said, "Wait a second.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   You're equating me with a murderer because I had hatred toward my brother?"
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   That's exactly what He says. That's exactly what He says.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   In fact, He goes further than that. Matthew 5, 27-28, "You have heard that it was said,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   'You shall not commit adultery.' But I say to you that everyone
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   with her in his heart." You're talking about an individual who remained faithful
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   to his wife for years and years and years, but because he had lust
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   in his heart that he is guilty of adultery as well?
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Now how is that fair? What kind of a
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   kingdom would that be fair? A murderer and somebody who hates
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   his brother, an adulterer who cheats on his wife, and somebody
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   who looks at a woman with lustful thoughts, he says, "Just as guilty as an
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   adulterer." How can that possibly be fair?
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   What Jesus says later on in Matthew 15, He says, "Hear and
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   understand this. It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   a person, but what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person."
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   In other words, what is He saying? Defilement is not something
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   that you just did or do. Defilement is who you
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   are. And because you are defiled,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   defiled things will happen. You will proceed to do and act out
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   things that are defiled because that's who you are. That's what Jesus was saying.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   That our sins go much deeper than what you
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   see on the surface. Adultery is a lot deeper than
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   just the act. Murder goes a lot deeper
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   than just the act of carrying it out. It is
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   our own corruption. And that's why in Matthew 23,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Jesus says, "Woe to you, scribes and pharisees, you hypocrites!
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   weightier matters of the law, justice and mercy and faithfulness. These
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   you ought to have done without neglecting the others. You blind guides, straining
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   out the gnat and swallowing a camel."
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   See a self-righteous person is always putting on display what they are
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   doing. This is what I've done and why aren't you doing
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   it? This is what I did in the past and how come you're not doing it?
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   A self-righteous person is very aware of the sins of other people,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   but they don't understand how hypocritical they are and
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   how deeply this sin is embedded in all of us.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Until we are broken over our sins,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Christ will mean little. You may love the church.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   You may love things of the church. You may love activity of the church, but you
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   will not love Christ until you recognize our brokenness
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   before a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Isaiah in the Old Testament among the Jews
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   arguably, and people can argue, who was the greatest prophet? Say Elijah was the greatest prophet.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Some may say Jeremiah. Some may say Elisha. And some may say
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Isaiah. Whether you agree with that or not, Isaiah is definitely
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   on the top of the list. And yet Isaiah
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   in order for God to prepare him for ministry reveals
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   to him his glory. And when he is in the presence of his glory, what happens
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   to Isaiah? He recognizes his wretched sin.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   And he falls to the ground. "Woe is me.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Woe is me." And that is the first character
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   of an individual who is walking in the presence of God. He is very
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   aware of his own sins. He is terrified
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   and he says, "Woe is me. Woe is me. I am a man of unclean lips.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   From a people of unclean lips. How can I possibly
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   be in the presence of this holy God?" An individual who is
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   meeting with God cannot be proud.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Because when you are in the presence of this glory, all of a sudden
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   every single person who thought he was clean recognizes his
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   uncleanness. And then he no longer is worried about other people.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Because he is concerned about himself.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   "Woe is me. Woe is me."
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   See, a self-righteous person is not aware of his guilt before God.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Or if he is aware of it, it is very superficial. It is something that happened in the past.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Justification is something that happened one time. But now
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   look at me. See, justification by faith
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   is not just past. It is present and it is future.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   That every single day, if I am not under the mercy of God,
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   I can't even come to him in prayer.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   I won't even understand his word.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   My flesh will naturally take me to the world. It is only
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   because he has been merciful to me that I can hear his word and understand.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   An individual
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   who does not recognize the corruption in his own heart
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   will live the rest of his life frustrated.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Frustrated with other people. Only if they change. Only if the church
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   changes. Only if we did this this way and that way. But he has never
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   broken over his own sins. Or it is very superficial.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   So that is why finally he says in verse 4, "Or do you presume
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience?" Not knowing that
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance. A self-righteous
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   person doesn't realize his desperateness and what the gift of God
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   really is. Gift of God
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   is the ability to be able to repent and for God to forgive. That's his gift.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   That he opened this door that we can come to him in confidence.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Again, you and I live in a generation where if something is
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   preached and you feel guilty about it, that that's not, that can't be from
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   God. Because God is about getting rid of guilt. Any kind of
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   burden. And that's why we preach a gospel where we almost skip the guilt
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   and go to forgiveness. We talk about, hey
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   this is who we are, we need forgiveness, and boom we are over here. Remember
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Paul, those of you who have been studying through 2 Corinthians with us? He writes
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   this very harsh letter to the Corinthians and he just unleashes on
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   them. He writes 2 Corinthians as a follow up because so many of them got
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   hurt from his letter. They were deeply hurt because
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Paul didn't hold back. I mean again he was like a doctor
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   on revealing their wound. And they are pumping
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   it up and he said, "Wow, this disease is much deeper and it's
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   spread much further than I thought." And so the whole 1 Corinthians he's
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   taking the bandages off and he's showing them this is your problem.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And so they were deeply hurt. Some of them were actually
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   fighting back. Maybe he's not an apostle, you know. He's
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   impressive in his letters but his appearance is nothing.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Paul writes this letter in 2 Corinthians he says, "You know what when I wrote this letter and I saw
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   how it hurt you I regretted it for a little bit. But
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   now I don't regret it. And the reason why I don't regret it is because it led you to
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   repentance." This is what he says, 1 Corinthians 7, 9, 11.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   "As it is I rejoice not because you were grieved but because you were
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   grieved into repenting. For you felt a godly grief so that
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   you suffered no loss through us. For godly grief produces repentance
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   that leads to salvation without regret. Whereas worldly
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   grief produces death. For see what earnestness this godly
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   grief has produced in you but also what eagerness to clear yourself, what
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment."
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   He says, "He brought this guilt upon
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   you to reveal to you where you stand before God that it would lead you to
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   repentance." He says, "Do you not know the fact that the reason why
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   I'm revealing this sin to you and why I'm calling you a hypocrite and why I'm
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   telling you all of this is because God's kindness will lead you to
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   repentance." Remember David?
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Man after God's own heart. I mean he's, up till
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   his sin, I mean David was the man, he was the man, God's handpicked
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   chosen leader of his people.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   But when you think of the sin that David commits
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   it's beyond comprehension. Because the man he
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   kills and his wife that he ends up committing adultery and
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   taking her for himself. This is a man that the Bible describes
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   as one of the great men who were so loyal to David he was willing to
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   take a knife for him. He was one of those men who ran around protecting David
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   when King Saul was after him. He was loyal to him. He was willing to die for
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   David and it was that guy and it was his wife that he committed
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   adultery and it was that guy he ended up killing.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   And it's beyond comprehension.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   But in Psalm 32, 3-5 you see the mercy of God on David
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   and this is how David describes, "For when I kept
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   silent my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   For day and night your hand was heavy upon me, my strength
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   was dried up as by the heat of summer." In other words,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   God put his finger on David because of his sin.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   He said, "My bones were wasting away."
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   He felt the pressure of his sin. Night and day it was heavy upon me.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Your strength, my strength dried up as the heat of
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   summer. And what Paul is saying here is do you
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   not recognize that that's God's kindness. The person
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   that we ought to be worried about is somebody who is living in sin and compromise and
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   feels no guilt. And just
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   I'm ok, you know God is so gracious and He is loving. He says,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   "No, it's God's kindness that leads you to repentance."
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   As a result of that he says, "I acknowledge my sin to you and I did not
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   cover up my iniquity. I said I will confess my transgressions to the Lord and you
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   forgave the iniquity of my sin." If we just superficially
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   just kind of sweep it under the rug and we live the rest of our
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   lives and we don't recognize the gift that we have in Christ is that the real gift of
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Christ is that He forgives us. He leads us to repentance.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   And repentance leads to life.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   In Psalm 51, 1-5 when David finally confesses
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   and repents and is forgiven this is what he says, "Have mercy
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   on me O God according to your steadfast love, according to your abundant mercy
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I know my transgressions and my
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   sin is ever before me." Now I want you to
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   look at what he says. He's not just confessing and act.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   He's not just confessing what he did.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   He said, "My sins are ever before me against you and you only have I sinned and done what is
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   evil in your sight so that you may be justified in your words and blameless
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   in your judgment." And then verse 5 look what he says, "Behold
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   I was brought forth iniquity and in sin did my mother
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   conceive me." It looks like wait is he blaming
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   his mom? Is he blaming his parents, his grandparents
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   for his sins? No. David recognizes
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   how deep his sin goes.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   He wasn't just a sinner when he committed the act. He said he was
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   born into this. He was born as a sinner.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   In fact he came even in the womb and he goes even further than that.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   And how deeply corrupt we are in our hearts
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   that even in our righteousness it becomes ugly because it becomes
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   self-righteousness. And until a sinner is in the presence
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   of a holy God and recognizes our desperate position
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   the gospel
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   loses its power. It just becomes
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   a doctrinal statement. It just becomes something to recite
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   something to memorize, something to repeat. But it doesn't have the power
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   to change us. To cause us to come and worship God
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   in reasonable response. Because we have
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   treated our sins lightly. That we just kind of covered
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   over it. Of course I'm not perfect.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Of course we're not. Where do you draw the line? How do you live perfectly? At least
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   I'm not like them. And as a result of that our
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   repentance was shallow and superficial.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And that's why Paul, I mean his whole goal is to bring
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   them to justification by faith. But in order to properly
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   get us to justification by faith we need to realize why
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   it was the only door. Why it is the only option
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   for a sinner. Why this is the only way. And
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   as long as we are pointing fingers at other people. As long
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   as we feel righteous and compared to the other sinners. As far
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   as long as we don't recognize a corruption in our own hearts
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   we won't recognize His kindness
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   that has opened a door. And is inviting us
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   to come in. Come to the throne of grace with
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   confidence. Come in.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   So every time we have a communion. Like we have communion
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   next week. That we recognize that
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   every single one of us comes as a broken sinner.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Now if there's one thing that I've learned in the 30 some years that I've
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   been a Christian. I thought when I became a Christian
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   I mean you know I know some people say, "Oh you know I don't know exactly when I got saved and it
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   took a while." And mine was unlike that. I know exactly when I got saved because my life
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   got flipped upside down. And I was so passionate
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   I was so eager. I wanted to live for Christ and
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   even if I die early that's okay with me because I wanted to live for Christ. I wanted to do all this.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   I'm going to make my scripture. Make disciples. Plant churches. And do all of this.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   But after 30 some years of walking with God. If there's one
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   constant thing that I learned over and over and over again
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   is just how incapable I am without
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   God. That this sin that He forgave me 30
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   some years ago. Just how deep this sin goes.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   That it wasn't just an act.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And that the only way
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   the only way that I would have any hope
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   is that the Son of God would cover me.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   That He would cover me from the wrath of God.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   I pray that as we continue to study through the book of Romans if there's anything
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   in these chapters, three chapters, I want to ask you a practical question.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   When was the last time that you were really broken
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   for your sins? You know we spend a lot of time talking about
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   frustration why other people are not repenting. Why other people are
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   not doing the right thing. Why other people should be doing this and this.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   And why church would be so much better if they did this and if we
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   did this. But when was the last time you were broken over your sin?
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Or is it typically
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   I know I'm not perfect but at least
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   I'm doing this. I know I'm not perfect but I'm not
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   like that. And as a result
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   we don't really understand the preciousness of what
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   we have in Christ. Let me ask you guys to take a minute to pray
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   with us. And as I ask the praise team to come up. Take some time to pray but this morning
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   I'm going to ask you not to pray for anything else but yourself.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Not to ask anything else. Are there sins that you swept under the rug?
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Maybe you don't really recognize the desperate need
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   that we have of Christ. Not to pay bills, not to
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   have a good family, but just to live.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   That I'm desperately in need
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   of Christ this morning. Whether you've done well
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   or bad or whether you've lusted or didn't or whether you did quiet time or didn't
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   every single one of us stands condemned before God without the blood of Christ.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   So I want to ask you this morning
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   to honestly come before God and say this prayer, "Lord,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   search me and know me. See if there's any hurtful ways in me. What is it in me
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   that I will not allow His kindness to lead me to repentance?
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   That I've allowed my own logic, my own self-righteousness
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   to justify my own sins?"
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   To come before the Lord and ask Him, "Lord, I pray that
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   Your Word would judge the thoughts and intentions of my heart." So let's take some time to pray
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   and pray for nothing else but to come before God and convict me
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   of my sins. That I may see
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   the glory of what Christ has done for me. Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
