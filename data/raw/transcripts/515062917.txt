[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.580]   You can turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11, verse 23.
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.920]   Hebrews chapter 11, verse 23.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.000]   And we're going to be reading up to verse 26.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.800]   So it's really going to be a two-part sermon about Moses, which will go down all to 29.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.900]   But I'm just going to read from 23 to 26 because those are the verses that we'll be dealing
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.280]   with this morning.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.280]   Reading out of the NASB, it says, "By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.180]   months by his parents because they saw he was a beautiful child and they were not afraid
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.820]   of the king's edict.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.800]   By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.240]   choosing rather to endure ill treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.160]   pleasures of sin.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.760]   Considering the reproach of Christ, greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.680]   was looking to the reward."
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.680]   Let's pray.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.900]   Heavenly Father, we pray for continued grace and guidance.
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:14.160]   May your words speak to us, cause us to understand your intention, not only to know, Father God,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.040]   the historical events, but what you desire for us.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.880]   Lord, search us and know us.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.460]   See if there's any hurtful ways in us that our worship that we give to you may truly
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.840]   be acceptable before your eyes.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.400]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.680]   Alright, so now we're at Moses' example of faith, the cloud of witnesses that he has
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.000]   established before us in chapter 11, not only to show us what happened in the record of
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.680]   the redemptive history in the Old Testament through the nation of Israel, but specifically
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.000]   in application, he says, "Considering the cloud of witnesses that has gone before us
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.040]   that we would also endure and live a life worthy of the calling that he has given us."
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.420]   This, just to give you a brief introduction, is probably somebody that we know better than
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.360]   anybody else in the Old Testament, simply because so much was written during his lifetime.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:12.880]   His lifespan is mentioned in the book of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.680]   And so he was the leader and establishment of leadership, giving of the law.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.880]   In fact, he's so prominent in the Old Testament that during the time of Jesus, they would
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.620]   call the Old Testament Moses and the prophets.
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.560]   So Moses and the prophets basically summarize all of the Old Testament.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.440]   We call it Old Testament, they called it the laws of Moses and the prophets.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.600]   That's how prominent he is.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.520]   You know, one of the interesting things is that Moses is credited to be the author of
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.840]   the first five books of the law, the Torah, the law.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.040]   And within that law, Moses describes himself in Numbers 12, 3 as being the humblest of
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.120]   the world on earth.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.680]   And so a lot of people poke fun of him because he wrote that about himself.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.000]   And it's like, "Oh, he couldn't help it because God dictated that, and so he was just writing
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   it.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.360]   So he didn't really mean it, but God told him to write it."
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.680]   And so a lot of people don't know what to do with that, that it was kind of a humble
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.680]   brag.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.040]   Like, "I'm the humblest in the world."
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.240]   It just kind of doesn't fit.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.920]   But I really think that he meant what he said, but the way that we take it is humble, kind
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.800]   of like, "Oh, you know, I'm no good at anything.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.600]   You know, you're better than me."
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.680]   I don't think that's what he's talking about.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:37.500]   I think he really was humbled because he's described as an individual who met God.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.280]   And even though it wasn't face to face, as God was passing by, he saw his glory and he
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.480]   got humbled.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.280]   In the presence of something magnificent.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.560]   So there was no other human being that was given that kind of vision, that kind of direct
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.720]   access to God that Moses did.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.280]   Moses received a law from God himself.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.400]   So when he says he was the humblest in the world, that wasn't a humble brag, right?
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.080]   Or they call it a bragamony, right?
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.960]   It's a testimony, but you're really bragging about yourself.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.320]   He said, "No, I think he was actually humbled."
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.760]   And that's what he means by that.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.120]   That in the presence of God's glory, he realized who he was.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.480]   And that's naturally what happens when people are confronted or in the presence of a God
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.240]   that they could not possibly imagine, they become humble.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.500]   And that's why a Christian who is filled with pride is an oxymoron.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.640]   Because naturally, when we are confronted by his glory, we become humble, right?
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.600]   Not we humble ourselves, we become humble.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.000]   Because there's nothing higher than him.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.640]   In the presence of him, we all tend to shut our mouth, right?
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.640]   Just like Isaiah, "Woe is me."
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.820]   That's the natural response of a sinner in the presence of God's glory.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.180]   And I think that's what he meant when he said he is the humblest, because he had access
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.280]   to God that other people did not have.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.080]   Moses lived 120 years, and of the 120 years, his life is divided into distinct three parts.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.320]   40 years in Pharaoh's house, 40 years as a shepherd, and 40 years leading the nation
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.920]   of Israel to get into the Promised Land.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.240]   So it's almost like he lived three very distinct lives.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.040]   You know, when I title my sermons, I usually don't put a lot of thought into it.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.080]   I just kind of put, you know, "Faith of Jacob," right?
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.680]   And that's usually, I don't really put a lot of thought into it, because I don't know how
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.440]   many of you look at it.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.040]   But I actually had a sermon title, and I changed it, because I think really, it's really captured
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.960]   his life.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:46.040]   Moses' story is from rags to riches, to rags to riches, to rags to riches, right?
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.360]   And so I think that kind of captures his life, because he was born as a slave, the rags,
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.640]   and then he was raised in Pharaoh's home, to riches.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.880]   And then because of what happens, he ends up going out as a shepherd, to rags.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.900]   And then God calls him and raises him to be leader of Israel, to riches.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.520]   And then they come out into the desert, and they wander because of their sin, to rags.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.860]   And then when he dies, God raises him up to his riches.
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.040]   So it's rags to riches, rags to riches, to rags to riches.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.500]   I mean, you know, most people, like even just one, if you're born really poor, and then
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.240]   you buy hard work, or whatever God did, and raised you up, that's enough to write a book
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.580]   about, right?
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.600]   Or somebody was really rich, and he made some dumb decision, and ended up living in poverty.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.280]   That's enough to write about.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.740]   But Moses' life is rags to riches, to rags to riches, to rags to riches.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.260]   You know, I did it the other way, right?
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.040]   And so his life is very interesting.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.400]   And as we've been talking about, by faith, and we know that there are very specific people,
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.820]   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Joseph, and how God's redemptive plan, God's sovereignty
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.260]   is orchestrating these things.
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.380]   And Moses' life is no different.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.980]   And I think not only Moses' life, but our life can be summed up in Romans 8, 28.
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.740]   It says, "And we know that God causes all things to work together for good, to those
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.460]   who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose."
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.700]   Every single one of us, right?
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.980]   You might be able to identify when you became a Christian, right?
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:24.560]   And I realize that my testimony is not average, you know, because I know specifically what
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.540]   date, what time, right?
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.620]   And I know exactly what happened.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.060]   I remember what the room looked like.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.380]   I remember what it was like at night.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.380]   I remember my emotions.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.700]   I remember coming down.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.700]   And I just thought that that's kind of how everybody became a Christian.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.740]   But I realize that most people just kind of are in the environment of Christians, and
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.940]   at some point, something happens, but they can't pinpoint exactly when that happens.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:52.940]   However, you came to Christ, whether you remember the specific date and time where you made
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.220]   that decision where God opened your eyes, or whether it was a gradual opening and you
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.100]   said, "Yes, you know, God really is real, and I want to follow him."
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.660]   However you came to Christ, there was a ton of other things that was taking place in order
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.060]   to bring you to that point.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.660]   You know, when I became a Christian, I thought my spiritual journey happened in 1983, you
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.580]   know, because that's when my eyes got opened.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:22.340]   So I didn't really connect the dots until years later I realized how much of my family
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:28.780]   and how the gospel came into my family through my grand...not my grandfather, my great-grandmother,
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.980]   because I asked my dad, "Who first became a Christian?"
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.820]   And then I found out it was my great-grandmother, and then that was the line that it came through.
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.980]   And then my grandfather was a pastor, and then my father was a pastor.
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:44.780]   And I didn't see this heritage until years later I realized all of that took place in
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.300]   order for me at that particular time, and all the other stuff, even the stuff that I
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.540]   was angry about, all of that stuff took place in order to bring me to that point where I
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:58.900]   was hungry, and when I desired God, you know, when he put that desire in me, that it was
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.340]   orchestrated to get me to that point.
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:06.740]   Every single one of us, whether you recognize it or not, there's tons of things, some things
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.980]   that you think are negative, some things that you think are positive, where God divinely
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.900]   orchestrated in order to fulfill his purpose.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:20.520]   So the sovereign God is working past, present, and even future.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.300]   So there's a purpose for this pandemic.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.780]   There's a purpose for persecution.
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.500]   There's a purpose for everything that's going on right now.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.820]   Sometimes we understand it, sometimes we don't understand it.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.460]   But God's redemptive plan is in his sovereign hands.
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:41.020]   He is deliberately orchestrating and moving and acting in order to fulfill his purpose.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:46.800]   That's why he can write the book of Revelations and tell us this is going to happen.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.980]   He's not just guessing and looking down the line and saying, "Well, if these happen,"
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.300]   and he just happened to be a great, great fortune teller.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.180]   He's looking down the line, "If these things can happen, if these people react this way,
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:02.180]   and this country does this, so many missionaries go out, at this particular time, this might
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.180]   happen."
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.100]   No, he's telling us that's what he's going to do.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.560]   He's telling us what he's going to do, what his plan is, right?
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:15.340]   So when we look at his redemptive plan, that's exactly how God's redemptive plan unfolds.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.440]   These are not random events that happen to happen because there are some good Christians
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.540]   or good people who reacted to God a certain way, and so therefore it triggered this and
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.620]   triggered that.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.540]   All of that stuff humanly is happening, but behind the scene, God is fully in control
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.740]   and orchestrating every part of this.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.840]   We see that first and foremost with Moses, right?
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:42.020]   It says in verse 23, "By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:47.100]   his parents because they saw he was a beautiful child and they were not afraid of the king's
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.100]   edict."
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.900]   First and foremost, he said it wasn't even Moses' faith.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.700]   Whose faith is it?
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.540]   His parents, right?
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.180]   Moses wasn't born and then he realized, "You know what?
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.620]   God has a special plan for me."
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:05.060]   By faith he told his parents to hide him so that he can be raised in a fairer home.
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:10.620]   This faith journey started way before he was even born.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.960]   In fact, it goes even further than that, right?
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.860]   You know the story, right?
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.100]   The Hebrews are growing in huge numbers.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:27.200]   The new pharaoh came in who completely forgets about Joseph and he decides to enslave them,
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.420]   but these slaves are just, you know, remember we talked about how Joseph, even in trouble,
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.660]   God's blessing was upon him and he was increasing in favor?
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.300]   And that's exactly what's happening with the nation of Israel.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:43.100]   Even as they are enslaved, as it was prophesied and told Abraham hundreds of years before,
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.620]   and it's actually happening.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:49.580]   And even in their suffering, God's blessing is upon them and they're increasing in number.
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:54.740]   The new pharaoh becomes paranoid that they're going to be too huge to be able to control.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.180]   So he has this idea, he sends out an edict and says, "You know, these midwives who are
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.940]   going to deliver these babies," he orders them to kill all the male Hebrew children
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.180]   that are born.
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:10.960]   The midwives in Exodus chapter 1, 4-5 said because they feared God more than Pharaoh,
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.380]   that instead of killing these children, they allowed them to live.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.880]   And so obviously the pharaoh gets angry and calls the midwives and says, "Why are you
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.100]   not carrying out my edict?"
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:24.780]   And they could have been killed by that, but by God's wisdom they said, "Well, we can't
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.180]   get there fast enough because these Hebrew women are delivering so quickly.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.740]   As soon as we hear of it, the baby's out and they're gone."
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.700]   Which is probably true, and that's why they were growing in number.
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:45.140]   So it wasn't even the parents' faith, even the midwives.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:52.300]   So they make an edict, they tell all the soldiers to go find the baby boys and kill them themselves,
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.240]   since they can't rely on the midwives.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.460]   So that's when his parents, by faith, because they feared God more than Pharaoh, more than
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:04.540]   their own lives, they hide him and then eventually they put him down and then they send him out.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:10.380]   But you know what's interesting is, if you look at verse 23, it says, "By faith Moses,
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.260]   when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents."
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.300]   Why?
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.700]   Because they saw he was a beautiful child.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.900]   Because he was a beautiful child.
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.820]   And they were not afraid of the king's edict.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.460]   All because he was a beautiful child.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.780]   What about the ugly ones?
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.820]   He was preserved because he was beautiful.
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:37.540]   Remember when we do inductive Bible study, if something just doesn't sound right or it
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:44.220]   doesn't make sense, before you jump to the commentaries, look at the different translations.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:50.980]   We're studying the NASB, and the versions that I look at are usually NIB, ESV, and King
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.980]   James.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.580]   And the reason why I look at those translations is that all three, those translations have
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.140]   different philosophies in their interpretation.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:05.260]   NASB being the literal, NIB just kind of trying to make sense of doing both.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:12.140]   ESV is kind of somewhere between NIB and the NASB, and then King James is, "I don't care."
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.460]   This is just what it says.
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.340]   So when you compare the translations, you'll see there's something going on in the Greek
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.700]   that couldn't be translated exactly the way we understand it.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:27.740]   If you look at this verse, the NIB says it this way, "By faith Moses, Moses' parents,
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:32.540]   hid him for three months after he was born because they saw he was no ordinary child."
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.220]   Now that doesn't sound exactly like beautiful.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:41.260]   And in the King James it says, "Because they saw he was a proper child."
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:45.220]   So clearly there's something going on in the Greek that doesn't sound the same in the English.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.220]   And so the word in Greek is "asteou."
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:55.300]   And the word "asteou" basically means someone who is sophisticated, someone who is honorable,
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.020]   someone who may be set apart, different than the others.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.220]   Not simply aesthetically beautiful.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:08.460]   He wasn't like, "Wow, look at this, how symmetrical his eyes and nose are, and so he must be preserved."
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:14.740]   There was something about the child that set him apart from the other children.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.260]   And I believe it wasn't vague.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:23.540]   Just as God made it very clear to Abraham what was about to happen.
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:28.860]   He says, "He prophesied from the very beginning of this covenant promise that you're going
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.620]   to be in captivity for 400 years, and when you come out, that I'm going to make you prosperous."
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:40.780]   So this event is the beginning of the nation of Israel, what was prophesied from the very beginning.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:49.700]   And so that covenant promise is being passed down from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to Joseph,
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.280]   and now to Moses.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.180]   In Amos 3, verse 7, it says, "Surely the Lord God does nothing unless he reveals his secret
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.060]   counsel to his servant, the prophets."
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.100]   And I believe that's exactly what was going on.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:09.020]   The prophecy was being passed down that God was going to use Moses to deliver the nation
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.340]   of Israel.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.100]   So his parents knew it.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.060]   And eventually Moses will find out about it, and then he will also carry this out.
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.780]   John Calvin says of this particular passage, this is what he says, "The parents of Moses
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.780]   were not induced by his beauty to be touched with pity and save him, as men are commonly
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.780]   affected.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.940]   But there was some sort of mark of excellence to come engraved on the boy which gave promise
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.140]   of something out of ordinary for him."
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.180]   So again, it wasn't just aesthetically, because he was aesthetically beautiful.
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:45.500]   God's sovereign hands was upon him and his family, because not only was he to save Israel,
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.840]   establish Israel, but through that, God was going to save mankind.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.580]   So the promise that he made in Genesis, that a child of the woman who's going to come crush
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:59.260]   the head of the serpent, that's what we're studying is the history of God fulfilling
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.980]   that promise right after the fall.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.340]   He's coming, he's coming, he's coming, he's coming.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:08.580]   And then, but before that happens, the nation of Israel needs to be established.
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.540]   So you could see kind of God orchestrating.
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.940]   When you see just the, you know, what happens with Moses is 40 years, 40 years, 40 years,
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.740]   you don't, you know, you still see God's sovereign hands, but when you see it collectively, that
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:26.140]   everything that is happening, the good and the bad, God works together all things for
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:31.260]   good, all things for good, not some things we understand, some things that say, "Oh,
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.420]   that's good."
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:38.420]   Even the things that we think are horrible, God is working all things for good to accomplish
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.220]   his sovereign purpose.
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:46.380]   In fact, you know, what's interesting is Exodus chapter 2, 6, 3, 8, it describes for us how
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.540]   he ended up in Pharaoh's house.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:56.620]   So the parents put him in a crib or a little box and, you know, pass him down through the
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.180]   river and it goes down and his older sister Miriam, who was somewhere around 11 or 12
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.460]   years old, no one knows exactly, but they're guessing that that's about how old she is.
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:10.580]   She follows the basket and then sees the Pharaoh's daughter was taking a bath down and then she
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.100]   sees the basket, opens it up and sees a child.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.620]   And here's the encounter that's recorded in Exodus chapter 2, 6, 3, 8.
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:21.180]   When she opened it, the Pharaoh's daughter, she saw the child and behold, the boy was
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.860]   crying and she had pity on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrew's children."
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.980]   Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, right, his sister, meaning Miriam, "Shall
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:35.420]   I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women?"
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.860]   I wonder who she was thinking about when she was suggesting this, right?
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:44.620]   Clearly, you're Pharaoh's daughter, you can't, you know, nurse this child.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:52.380]   You want me as your servant, get somebody to help you raise this child?
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.940]   Obviously she's thinking about her mother, the mother sacrificing and let the baby go
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.100]   and God in his sovereign hands, right, causes the baby to be raised.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.100]   Look what it says.
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.420]   "She may nurse the child for you."
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.060]   Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go ahead."
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.820]   So the girl went and called the child's mother.
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:13.780]   Then Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away and nurse him for me and I
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.620]   will give you your wages."
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.060]   Right?
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:24.540]   Not only does she get to nurse her own child, she's going to get paid by Pharaoh's daughter
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:30.020]   to raise her own child that she sent down the river probably thinking, you know, and
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:36.580]   worried and God sends the baby back with money, right?
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.660]   And so the Pharaoh's daughter basically says, "Raise him until I don't have to deal with
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.420]   his snots," you know, and then changes diaper.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.140]   Of course, they didn't have diapers back then.
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:49.540]   But basically do the hard part, okay, and then bring him back when I can enjoy him.
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.980]   So we don't know exactly how old because it doesn't tell us, but my guess is, you know,
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:59.460]   anybody who's raised kids around five, they become easier, right?
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.980]   And then just skip the teenage years, you know what I mean?
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.220]   Then get to the adult.
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.820]   We don't know exactly how many years, but it was enough.
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:11.740]   And I'm pretty sure Pharaoh's mom was not eager to send him away.
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.580]   So she probably held on to him as long as she could.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.740]   But can you imagine the education that he must have gotten from his mom?
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.500]   Because his parents already knew that he was special, right?
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.740]   To what degree, we don't know.
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:27.860]   But to the degree that God made it plain to them that he was beautiful, he was set apart,
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.860]   right?
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:34.540]   And then they find out a little bit later that he knew a lot more than what we thought,
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.780]   right?
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.300]   So God sovereignly, this is not planned by man.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:44.380]   Like in the midst of the Pharaoh trying to kill this child, Pharaoh's daughter ends up
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:49.660]   bringing him into, right, into the very thing that he was trying to eradicate.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:55.620]   He ends up bringing the child into his home, paying the mother to raise this child, right?
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.780]   Only God can orchestrate something like that, right?
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.180]   God's completely sovereign.
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:08.300]   And it is in this sovereign God that Abraham had faith in.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:15.340]   If the God that you worship is a tiny God, right, it will be reflected in the way that
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.540]   you live.
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:24.180]   You will trust him when he is trustable, when he makes sense, when your future is laid out,
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.100]   when everything makes sense, the bills are paid, and everything is done that I can take
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:34.300]   care of, and only the things that I have no control over, it's like, "God, I trust you."
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.100]   Because you don't have ability to trust yourself because everything is done.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:44.300]   So that's why when we get sick, we lose our job, when desperate things happen, God's like,
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:49.460]   "God, we need you, but every other time I can take care of myself."
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.180]   It's because we have a very small view of God.
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:58.140]   See, when you look at redemptive history, God is far beyond what you and I could possibly
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.860]   imagine.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:05.980]   And God has orchestrated all of this, and it is this God that Moses knew.
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:11.140]   And that's why it says in Psalm 24, "By faith Moses, when he grew up, refused to be called
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.820]   the son of Pharaoh's daughter."
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.820]   Now think about what that means.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.660]   His parents were slaves.
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:24.660]   They're not just low middle class or lower class, they're slaves, they don't own anything.
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.140]   There is no future for a slave.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:31.140]   You can work hard as you can, and you might be given some responsibility, but as a slave,
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.740]   there is no future for you, for your children, your grandchildren.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.220]   As long as you're a slave, the harder you work, you just work, that's it.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.740]   But he says, "Because he believed in this sovereign God, he refused to be called the
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.420]   son of Pharaoh's daughter."
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.380]   The son of Pharaoh's daughter, what it would have meant to be raised in Pharaoh's home.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.380]   That means everything that you and I can possibly imagine he had.
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:02.380]   I would think his position is better than Pharaoh, because Pharaoh has to rule the country.
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.820]   Pharaoh has to take out the laws.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.380]   He has to worry about people trying to overthrow him.
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:12.140]   If you're a child in a Pharaoh's home, you get to enjoy everything that the Pharaoh has
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.140]   without the responsibility.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.540]   So I think that's a better position than the Pharaoh.
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:22.140]   He had everything that a human being could possibly imagine, and he says he refused to
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.820]   be called the Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to endure ill treatment with the people
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.420]   of God than to enjoy the passing pleasure of sin.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.780]   You can look at that and say, "Oh, he was very nationalistic.
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:39.820]   He was so proud of being a Hebrew that he was willing to identify with the slaves rather
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.460]   than with Pharaoh."
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.440]   If you look at it on the surface, we may think that that's what's going on.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.540]   He was just a very proud Jew.
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.620]   No wonder the Jews see him as the highest among the Jews.
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:55.740]   But it says, "Considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.740]   Egypt, for he was looking to the reward."
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.420]   Clearly, it wasn't just nationalism.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.280]   He saw beyond nationalism.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:13.260]   He said his reproach of Christ was greater than the treasures of Egypt.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.820]   Now we're going to get to this in a bit about what he means by the treasures of Christ or
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:21.940]   reproach of Christ, and he was looking forward to the reward.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:28.220]   But Acts chapter 7, 22 to 25, actually explains a little bit more in detail exactly what Moses
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.820]   knew.
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:35.740]   And it describes the background behind why he was able to trust in this God and forsake
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.780]   the riches and identify with these slaves.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.460]   This is Stephen.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.500]   Right before he gets stoned, he basically gives redemptive history.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.900]   This is what's going on, and he basically is preaching the gospel.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.780]   And in the gospel preaching, he mentions Moses, and this is what he says in verse 22.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:59.700]   "Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and he was a man of power in
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.440]   words and in deeds.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.780]   But when he was approaching the age of 40, it entered his mind to visit his brethren,
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.860]   the sons of Israel.
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:13.100]   And when he saw one of them being treated unjustly, he defended him and took vengeance
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.520]   for the oppressed by striking down the Egyptians."
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.520]   And look at verse 25.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:21.220]   "And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance from
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:25.300]   him, but they did not understand."
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.580]   When did the calling of Moses happen?
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.940]   Was it before or after this event?
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.460]   When did the burning bush happen?
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.460]   Way after this.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.180]   40 years after this.
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:48.300]   But Stephen describes and says, when he stood, and he stood with the Hebrews, he said he
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:55.980]   thought, he thought that the Hebrews would have understood that he was called to deliver
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.660]   Israel.
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:04.740]   But what surprised him was, instead of thanking him, next time he comes out and says, "Well,
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.660]   you're going to kill us too?"
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:12.260]   And he realized that they did not know, and they weren't embracing him as a leader.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.540]   And that's what discourages him and causes him to run out to the desert.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.820]   Doesn't that cause you to see the burning bush incident very differently?
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.980]   Because when he's at the burning bush and God says, "I want you to go and tell Pharaoh
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:30.740]   to let my people go," and Moses says, "No, no, no, not me.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.900]   My brother is the one who can talk.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.900]   You don't want to use me."
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.700]   And they said, God became angry.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.380]   He got angry because Moses was humble.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.900]   It kind of puts a different light to that.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.260]   Moses was not simply saying, "No, I'm humble.
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.260]   I'm not good at this."
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.540]   It's like, because Moses knew that there was a calling in his life.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.340]   So by the time he gets the burning bush, God was calling him back.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.540]   Now is the time.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.400]   You thought it was going to happen 40 years ago, but now is the time.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:08.120]   So when Moses said, "No," he was, in a sense, "I don't want that responsibility."
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:12.720]   And that's why God became angry, because that's the reason why his parents did what they did.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.320]   That's the reason why he was preserved.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.880]   That's the reason why he was raised at Pharaoh's house.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.040]   All of that to prepare him.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:24.880]   But he was discouraged because his countrymen didn't embrace him.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.440]   But obviously, God had different plans and he raised him, and he reconnects with this
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:36.400]   God, and because he believed in the sovereign God, he did what was completely unnatural.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.900]   It's unnatural.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:43.000]   It's unnatural for a man, humanly speaking, who grew up in Pharaoh's house, to reject
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.840]   all of that and identify with these slaves.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:56.480]   If I was to drop this key, what do you think is going to happen?
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.480]   Anybody surprised?
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.480]   I'm going to do it again.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.800]   Did it again.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.760]   Maybe if I keep doing it, something else is going to happen.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.760]   What?
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:14.000]   Maybe if I do it 100 times, maybe one of the times, at least one time, 1%, right?
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   I'm stubborn.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   I'm going to keep doing this until -- oh, did it again.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.080]   None of you are surprised.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:26.240]   I can do this 1,000 times, and 1,000 times, we expect this to drop.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.000]   But if this doesn't drop and it goes up, how will you react?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Right?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.320]   He's a good magician.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.120]   Because you're going to think something's going on.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.440]   But I know him.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.320]   I've never seen any magic trick before.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.240]   I know this guy.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.240]   Something's going on.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.240]   Gravity?
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.240]   Oh, shoot.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.240]   Are we losing gravity?
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:53.240]   Are we going to die?
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.280]   Something's going to cause you to examine what happened.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.520]   Why did that happen?
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:06.280]   All of redemptive history is the key going up instead of down.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:14.360]   All of redemptive history is going against the natural events, and to look and say, what's
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.360]   going on over there?
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.840]   Why would that happen?
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.700]   Why did he do that?
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.800]   Whether God did it supernaturally, or whether he orchestrated certain things, and why certain
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:28.400]   people responded in a way that was unnatural, all of redemptive history is a revelation
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:34.760]   of God's glory that causes mankind to look at that and say, why did that go up?
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:43.720]   Why did Moses forsake everything he had to identify with these Jews and live a difficult
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.440]   life?
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:50.660]   The only answer that was given, he considered reproach of Christ greater than the treasures
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.660]   of Egypt.
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:55.440]   He was looking for the reward to come.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:02.240]   He knew this sovereign God, and he believed that the promises that he made was much greater
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:10.120]   than anything that he already had in Pharaoh, because whatever he had in Pharaoh was temporary.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.080]   Whatever treasure that he had with him is temporary, but what God was going to give
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.880]   him is eternal, and that's why he says he was looking forward.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.580]   It wasn't simply because he was nationalistic.
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.100]   It wasn't because he was a noble man.
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.080]   It was simply because he had faith.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:34.280]   He believed that the treasures that were coming was much greater than whatever he had in Christ.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:41.880]   You know, even as believers, sometimes our lives don't look any different than natural
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.920]   law, because we do things that just come naturally.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:51.840]   You know, after being a pastor for so many years, I can watch the cycle, and it's predictable
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.400]   people's behavior.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:00.640]   What happens when you first come into college, eager to get out, enjoy life, enjoy freedom,
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.880]   and then you regret it your second year, right?
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:08.440]   Then you got to catch up, then you become a sophomore, sophomore, sophos, moranos, wise
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.440]   fool.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.440]   That's what that literally means.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:15.200]   You just have just some, just enough information to make you a fool, right?
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.400]   And then by the time you get to third year, you start to gain knowledge.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.960]   You're a junior, but you're not a senior yet.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.920]   You don't quite know, but you're starting to know, and you're realizing, like, oh, shoot,
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.000]   I better get my act together.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.360]   And then by senior year, you take 20, 30 units to get out, right?
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.360]   You need to finish up.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.080]   You need to catch up.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:39.920]   You get out, you become a BAM member, and you're trying to struggle, and real life hits
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.420]   you.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:48.240]   And then you look fondly to your college life, only if I was back then, and then so I'm guessing
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:54.000]   if you are a baby BAM, that your advice, whenever you see college students, is like, you ain't
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   see.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.800]   And you can't stomach college students' complaints, and you got it easy, because life has hit
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   you, right?
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:11.400]   Nine to five, it's nine to five every day, all day, all week, all year, all decade.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.140]   All life.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.640]   And you're just starting.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.760]   Hello.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.760]   And that hits you.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.360]   It hits you hard, right?
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:30.120]   And then after that, you start, you know, really, if you're a single adult making money,
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.960]   you have more money than you'll ever have, right, unless you become filthy rich, but
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.880]   most people, that's because you don't have a lot of responsibilities during that period.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.280]   And you have all the freedom that you want, because you're not married, you don't have
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:48.720]   kids yet, and everybody envies you, right, worldly speaking, right?
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.960]   But there's no other groups of people in life that is eagerly waiting to get out of that
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.520]   than the singles.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.520]   When is my turn?
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.760]   When do I get to the next stage, right?
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.640]   Lord willing, you get to the next stage, you get married and have kids, right?
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.000]   So if you don't have kids, it's like, when do we get kids?
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.480]   And then that's what you live for.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.440]   And then when you do have kids, it's like, oh, my gosh, when are they going to grow up?
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.440]   Right?
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.720]   And then when they grow up, it's like, I wish they were kids again.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.680]   This cycle of life, it's like, that's natural.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.760]   You observe year after year after year, it's just a matter of you transitioning to the
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.800]   next stage, and another person comes, they go through the same thing, another person
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   comes.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.480]   And that's why Solomon says there's nothing new under the sun.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.320]   But guess what?
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.640]   Even sometimes the way we live our Christian life is predictable.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.300]   It's predictable.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.920]   Because religion is predictable.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.920]   Because we want to belong somewhere.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.520]   We want to have a sense of purpose.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:34:00.160]   And so some find it in politics, some find it in religion, some find it in Hinduism,
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.580]   some find it in Buddhism, some find it in Christianity.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:07.400]   But the root reason is because they want to belong somewhere.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.560]   So this is my community.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.900]   So it's predictable.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:15.020]   Year after year, you observe, you know, you get certain kind of personalities gravitate
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.340]   toward this, and certain people are like that, and certain people are like this, and it's
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:21.760]   so predictable.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:27.400]   But what is beyond reason is what Christ did.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:32.280]   Because he didn't just tell us to love, because everybody, by natural law, a mother loves
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   a child.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.280]   That's natural law.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.560]   That's just what happens.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.660]   You love the people who love you.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:38.660]   That's natural law.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.520]   That's not uniquely Christian.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:46.920]   Everybody, even people who hate Christ, practices some kind of law, some kind of love.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.080]   But the love that he showed us is while we were yet sinners.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.640]   So he basically came and it went up.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:59.280]   And that's what makes the cross intriguing.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.640]   Why would he do that?
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:06.560]   So when he revealed his glory, it causes people to say, "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.800]   Why did he do that?
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.600]   Why was he doing that?"
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:16.720]   And then he called us to live a life against the natural law.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:22.160]   When he says to pick up your cross and follow me, a child who was born into this world,
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.640]   from day one, he wants to live.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.200]   He comes out sucking.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.320]   It's very interesting.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.320]   Nobody taught him that.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.000]   Nobody discipled him.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.960]   He comes out sucking, like wanting food.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:43.320]   And so he's already learned to survive from the get-go.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.360]   But Jesus said, "If you want to live, you have to die."
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.360]   See, the very symbol of death was the cross.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:56.240]   And Jesus, instead of walking to live better, he walked deliberately into Jerusalem to be
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.620]   hung on that cross.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:01.440]   And he told his followers, "You follow me, too."
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:05.520]   And so what he did was completely against the natural law.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.840]   And then he told his disciples to do the same.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:12.520]   You pick up your cross, you deny yourself, and you follow me, and the world is going
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.700]   to look at you and say, "Why are you doing that?
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.480]   Why are you turning the other cheek?
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.360]   Why are you going there?
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.620]   Why did you do that?
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.880]   You had so much potential.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.000]   Why would you forsake that?
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.680]   If you do this, you're going to make so much more money.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.640]   Why did you do that?
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.920]   Why would you pack up your bags and go to places that are uncomfortable?
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.920]   For what reason?
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.920]   What do you benefit?"
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.440]   And so the world is constantly looking at the Christian community, trying to figure
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.360]   out what the Christians are doing.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:47.160]   For majority of the Christians in the church, they can explain it, because it's a security
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.160]   blanket.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.480]   "Oh, that's why you're doing that, right?
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.180]   You're doing that because you have a sense of belonging.
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.020]   You're doing that because that's your purpose.
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.620]   You're doing that because you were raised in a Christian home.
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.200]   You're doing that because of a certain nationality."
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.040]   And so they explain it off, and you say, "Oh, that's why."
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.520]   They just are looking for the natural law that you are functioning under.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:15.840]   But what God called us to do is to do something completely unnatural.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:22.200]   What the world does not understand and will not understand until we meet this Christ who
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.600]   went outside the gate and forsook everything.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.680]   Being God himself, not considering equality with God, something to be grasped, but he
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.520]   emptied himself, became nothing.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:37.280]   And he tells us to have the same mindset, that our witness is to be supernatural.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:43.240]   If we love those who are lovable, yeah, of course.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.420]   Everybody does that.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:49.640]   If you look for safety and comfort, yeah, that's natural.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.080]   That's what everybody does, right?
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.480]   Everybody hurts you, you hurt them.
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.520]   That's natural.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.760]   Everybody's ambitious to get ahead.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.440]   We just happen to be Christian ambition, right?
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.440]   That's natural.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.440]   That's what everybody does.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:08.400]   You just happen to find it in this particular circle.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.840]   But everything that God calls us to do is unnatural.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.680]   That's why he calls us out.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:22.840]   So what Moses did, the only explanation for what Moses did was because he met a supernatural
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:27.640]   God who was sovereign, and he believed him.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.800]   He believed him.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.040]   That's why Paul did what they did.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.600]   That's why the disciples did what they did.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.720]   That's why missionaries do what they do.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:40.600]   That's why so many Christians live contrary to what the world understands.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:47.600]   Because what we value is far greater than whatever this world can offer.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:52.200]   First John 2, 16-17 says, "For all that is in the world, the lust of the eyes, the lust
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.560]   of the flesh, the boastful pride of life is not from the Father, but from the world.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.040]   The world is passing away, and also its lust, but the one who does the will of God lives
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.040]   forever."
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:06.000]   You notice here, whenever we talk about this passage, we have a tendency to focus on the
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.560]   lust.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.720]   The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and boastful pride of life.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.640]   Because we can easily say, "I'm not lusting."
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:19.920]   Because with lust, we have an image of somebody who's just out of control.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.560]   It's an out of control passion they can't control.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.680]   Lust basically means powerful passion, something you're passionate about.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:34.840]   But the part that you and I should all pay attention to is the all.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.840]   All that is in the world.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.000]   That's what he was trying to get at.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.080]   We have a tendency to think that there's a part of things that we need to avoid, like
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:47.640]   pornography, sexual immorality, killing, murder.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.080]   And so these are things that we know are no good.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.800]   And then we have the godly stuff, reading the Bible, making disciples, sharing the gospel.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.960]   These are the good stuff.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:01.720]   But where you and I get into trouble is this whole part in the middle where we think God
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.800]   doesn't really have anything to say.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.400]   Most of us don't get tripped up because of that.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.680]   Even though that is, you know, that trips us up too.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.400]   But most of us don't get tripped up on that.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:19.640]   We get tripped up on all this other stuff in the middle that really have nothing to
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.760]   do with God.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:27.520]   But we get so entangled pursuing the natural law.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.520]   Take care of our kids.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.240]   What's wrong with taking care of our kids?
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.040]   What's wrong with, you know, like all this stuff?
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.040]   They're all neutral stuff.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:40.960]   So we pour all our energy toward the neutral stuff that really has nothing to do with God.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.960]   And so by the time we get to this side of pursuing God, what we know to be godly, there's
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.960]   very little energy that we give to this.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:55.960]   The call to a Christian is to follow the unnatural law of Christ.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.240]   To pick up our cross and follow him as he went to the cross.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:04.600]   He's not simply telling us to sacrifice and live hard lives and suffer for the name of
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   Jesus.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:12.040]   He's simply telling us until you let go, until you let go, you will not understand what's
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.640]   coming.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:18.280]   You have to first let go and follow me.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:23.240]   Moses did what he did because he saw a greater reward in Christ than he did with Pharaoh.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.480]   That's why.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.560]   And why any Christian will follow Christ is for the same reason.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.560]   You can go to church.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.940]   You can participate.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:35.440]   You can do some good stuff.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:40.080]   But again, if we're not careful, we're just following the natural law, just doing what's
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.080]   best for us.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:46.440]   Of course, I want my kids to have good morals and have friends and community, you know,
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.520]   and to do things together and have a purpose.
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:53.400]   And all of that stuff is good, but it's natural.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.940]   Every human being does that.
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:58.080]   We just happen to do it as Christians.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:04.540]   God's calling is bigger than that because his reward is much bigger than that because
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:09.420]   God is much bigger than that.
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:16.140]   Hebrews 12, 2 to 3, fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and the perfecter of the faith,
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:21.620]   who for the joy set before him endured the cross.
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:22.620]   Joy set before him.
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.100]   What do you think he's talking about?
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.780]   Joy set before him.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.220]   He's talking about us.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.340]   He endured the cross.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.260]   What benefit did he have?
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.060]   What does he get out of this?
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:40.340]   He said the joy that he's referring to is us, our salvation, our praise of his name,
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.180]   our loyalty to him, our love for him.
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:49.460]   That joy, that joy set before him, he endured the cross, despising the same, and has sat
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:54.300]   down at the right hand of the throne of God and consider him who has endured such hostility
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:59.020]   by sinners against himself so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.020]   That's what it means.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:06.580]   He endured the reproach of Christ because he saw the reward that's coming was greater.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:11.740]   And that's the question that you and I wrestle with.
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.200]   Is he greater?
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.220]   Not is he good?
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.220]   Is he greater?
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:23.180]   Do you remember when Peter fell and Jesus was restoring him?
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:24.980]   And Jesus asked him, "Do you love me?"
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.060]   He didn't just ask me, "Do you love me?"
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.340]   He said, "Do you love me," what?
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.220]   "More than these?"
[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.500]   And we don't know what the these are.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.980]   These could be the other disciples.
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:41.100]   These could be the fish that they caught.
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.640]   We don't know for sure.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.660]   But I think the meaning behind the these is much more broader than that.
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:50.180]   Love me more than anything else.
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.540]   Because that's what it says in the other parts of the Bible.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:56.340]   To love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:00.980]   He says he has this against the Church of Ephesus because they have forsaken their first
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.400]   love, their priority love.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:07.760]   So when he says these, I don't think he was just referring to fish or his disciples, meaning
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.460]   everything else, even your own life.
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:15.980]   Do you love me more than these?
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:22.100]   Because if we say yes to that, we will live our lives unnaturally.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.440]   Unnaturally.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.500]   We don't invest today for a payoff tomorrow.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:31.780]   We don't make decisions because that will make us richer tomorrow.
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:37.860]   We live lives against the flow that everybody else is going because we believe the reward
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.940]   is coming in Christ.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.860]   And that's what he's laying out for us.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:46.700]   Some people got elevated and then they die elevated.
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.460]   Some people, they died in prison.
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:55.340]   But all of them were looking beyond this life for greater reward.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.420]   You know, I want to sing this song together.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.480]   You know that song, I Have Decided to Follow Jesus?
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:04.780]   If you grew up in the church, you know, maybe you grew up in a church that spoke different
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:05.780]   language.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:08.060]   This is one of those songs that's universal.
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:12.260]   Every church you go to in other countries, you'll hear this song and they know this song.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.660]   I have decided to follow Jesus.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:14.860]   I have decided to follow Jesus.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.940]   No turning back, no turning back.
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:21.420]   But there's a story behind this.
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:29.000]   Years ago, American Baptist missionaries ended up going to a very hostile village in India
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.860]   and started to share the gospel and this one family came to Christ.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:38.820]   And then because the village that they were at was so hostile to the gospel, the village
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:43.940]   leader came out and basically threatened the father, said that you need to renounce your
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:44.940]   faith.
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:49.180]   And the father would not and he said, I have decided to follow Jesus.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.180]   No turning back.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:54.100]   He said, if you don't denounce your faith, we're going to murder your children.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:55.620]   And he said, I cannot.
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.560]   I can't turn back.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:04.260]   And so the chief ordered the people to shoot arrows into his two boys.
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.380]   And so right in front of his eyes, the two boys died.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:11.540]   And he says, if you don't denounce your faith now, even your wife, we're going to take.
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:16.860]   He says, the cross before me, the world behind me, no turning back, no turning back.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.740]   Though none will follow, I will continue to go.
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.460]   No turning back, no turning back.
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:28.540]   So he shot his wife and killed her and then also killed the husband.
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:29.540]   That's the song.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.540]   That's the story behind the song.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:38.500]   But the story goes that in his resolve to remain faithful to his Lord, and again, completely
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.660]   unnatural.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:46.060]   With his life, his children's life, his wife's life about to be extinguished, he stood firm
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.540]   in his faith.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:56.500]   And so the village people, including the chief, couldn't understand why this key went up.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:01.020]   And so he wanted to examine what was it about this Jesus that he was willing to give his
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.540]   life and his family's life.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:04.260]   So he started asking questions.
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.820]   He came to faith.
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:12.020]   And because of his influence, the village became a Christian village.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.780]   That's the story behind this song.
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:21.540]   I have decided to follow Jesus.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:26.860]   My prayer is that you and I would know this Jesus.
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.820]   I know we're weak.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.820]   You don't have to tell me.
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:31.820]   I know you are.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.780]   Because I know I am.
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:38.580]   I don't have the resolve to be faithful.
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:41.020]   I'm not disciplined enough.
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.900]   I'm not honorable enough.
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.220]   I'm not pure enough.
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:47.220]   I don't have the ability.
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.220]   I'm going to do it.
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.220]   I'm going to do it.
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:50.220]   This time I'm really going to do it.
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:56.260]   You know how many times I've done that and failed miserably?
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.880]   It's not because I didn't want it.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.900]   It's not because I didn't try.
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:04.140]   It wasn't because I wasn't passionate enough.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.140]   It wasn't because I wasn't educated.
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.860]   I wasn't taught enough.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:13.180]   I'm so corrupt inside.
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:15.500]   I don't want to be but I am.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:20.740]   And I'm waiting to be delivered when Christ comes.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:25.760]   All the more why if we don't abide in Christ, we can't bear fruit.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:31.260]   If we don't keep our eyes on Jesus and our faith is not being renewed for the promise
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:39.940]   that's coming, your resolve isn't going to cause you to make it.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:43.020]   Do you believe in this God?
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:46.340]   Do you believe in this sovereign God?
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:51.440]   Do you believe in the unnatural work that Jesus did on the cross?
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:57.420]   How do you choose to follow this Jesus who went outside the gate?
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:04.260]   So again, as we look at Moses' life and how he followed him and all the patriarchs and
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:10.500]   the ladies who loved God more than this world, the cloud of witnesses that have gone before
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:15.400]   us, let us choose to go outside the gate with him as well.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.400]   Let's sing this song together.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:24.580]   I'm going to ask the team to come up and to -- we're going to sing this song.
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:31.660]   And as we sing this song, again, think of the story behind it and that this would be
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:36.940]   our prayer as well, that we would have the courage and we would have the faith to say
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.020]   these things.
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:44.340]   Even though our life is not threatened, that even in comfort, that this would be our testimony.
