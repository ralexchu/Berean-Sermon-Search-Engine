[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   Lord, our hearts were just fed. God, remembering and appreciating Christ, his work,
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.960]   his presence in our lives, and the great grace that, God, we have simply through faith,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.960]   all on the account of your incredible work. We're so grateful.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.960]   And then, God, we're happy to be back in Bible study.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   And Lord, I pray that as we are just regularly trying to study and glean,
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.960]   would you bless us with knowledge, wisdom, and understanding.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   But also, God, help us truly to saturate in your word in such a way that, God,
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:44.960]   we are prepared for the spiritual battle. We are warned of the falsehood that exists
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.960]   in this world and generation. And, God, that we would be strong, not in our own right,
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.960]   but because of the word of God that is strengthening us to fight against
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.960]   the various things that are happening in our lives.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   And we also pray, God, that as we gather together, help us to be strong as a community,
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.960]   joining together, Lord, spiritually, beyond just simply having our connections
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.960]   and friendships, but let it be a true fellowship where we're encouraging each other,
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.960]   God, to be faithful to you week in and week out.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.960]   We want to thank you again for this time. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.

[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:39.940]   Wondrous faith to bear that cross To bear my sin, what wondrous love
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:49.940]   Hope was sure, there my Savior played Father, not my will, but Yours entirely

[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:28.860]   Okay.
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:32.860]   I hope and pray that you guys had a fruitful time just preparing
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:37.860]   and then reviewing
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.860]   the segment of the passage.
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.860]   As a reminder, you can text in questions.
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:46.860]   I will do my best to take a look and answer,
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.860]   but my guess is as we go through the passage,
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:50.860]   it will kind of self-answer some of these things.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:55.860]   Let's take a moment to pray, ask God's blessing over the review.
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:06:02.860]   Lord God, we really pray, Lord, that with all humility,
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:07.860]   we would have such a devotion to your truth,
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:12.860]   such a loyalty to what is explicitly stated in Scripture.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:17.860]   God, that regardless of what it means for us in consequence,
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:21.860]   we would always make decisions to obey.
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.860]   God, I pray that you grant to us strength as these principles apply
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:29.860]   to so many different situations and circumstances of our lives.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:34.860]   Grant to us, Lord God, strength in every day to follow your word.
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:35.860]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.860]   Amen.
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:42.860]   Now, by way of just review, my request is please,
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:47.860]   when I ask the question, try your best to answer and review.
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:51.860]   The easiest one to kind of get at is the letter so far,
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:54.860]   when we have been studying the book of Galatians,
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:58.860]   it has been kind of unsettling because it has been not just once
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:02.860]   or twice, but almost five, six iterations of different kinds
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.860]   of arguments trying to convince the church, and therefore,
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:09.860]   sometimes the tone was very one of disappointment,
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:13.860]   but all throughout, it just started with a banger of, man,
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:17.860]   I am so shocked and amazed how quickly you're deserting the one,
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.860]   right, and Savior.
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:22.860]   So the tone of it has been intense.
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:26.860]   Now, by way of quick review, we ask the question, but why?
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:32.860]   Why is it necessary, and why is the tone so intense?
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:34.860]   Any volunteers?
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:41.860]   Just in a brief way describing why the letter has such a tone.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.860]   Going once.
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.860]   Twice for extra credit.
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:48.860]   Yes.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:54.860]   Thank you, brave soul.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.860]   Because the Judaizers came in, and Apostle Paul is fighting
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.860]   the spreading of the false gospel, okay?
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.860]   Why is the tone so intense?
[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:07.860]   It's because there is a spiritual battle happening, right,
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:09.860]   for the territory of the minds and hearts of the saints
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.860]   within the church.
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.860]   But more, more so than that, too, if you think about it,
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.860]   the way that Apostle Paul has been trying to convince
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:20.860]   the church was, you think this is just simply adopting
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:23.860]   somebody's, like, tradition?
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.860]   What about Christ?
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:28.860]   To distort the gospel doctrine is to try and mess
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:30.860]   with the character of Christ, just in the same way
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:34.860]   that you would never just by your own whim decide,
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:36.860]   you know what Christ is like?
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:37.860]   You know what he's thinking?
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:38.860]   You know what he believes?
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:40.860]   You know what he does?
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.860]   To distort the doctrines would be to distort
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:45.860]   with Christ himself, yes?
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:49.860]   And so there is a place for righteous indignation,
[01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:52.860]   especially in the way that Apostle Paul puts it,
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.860]   was in the very beginning, he says,
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:56.860]   anybody who preaches another gospel,
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:58.860]   even if it were spiritual beings, angels,
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:00.860]   let them be anathema, right?
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:03.860]   Because what is happening is not just messing
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:06.860]   with different religions, you're deserting the Savior.
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:10.860]   Okay, that's where we came from in the last segment
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:12.860]   that this is by way of review.
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.860]   If you remember in verse 1 through 6, he said,
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:16.860]   "The consequences of you doing this,
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:19.860]   you will have been separated from Christ.
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:20.860]   You've fallen from grace."
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:22.860]   And so we have to know that.
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:24.840]   The other thing I want to review is
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.840]   as we've been discussing the various passages
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.840]   within Galatians, I do think there's a need
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.840]   for us to regularly try and define
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:34.840]   what we're talking about.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:35.840]   Why?
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.840]   Primarily because in our day, legalism,
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.840]   its definition is really, really broad.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.840]   So do I have another volunteer
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:46.840]   to answer the question in a very short
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:47.840]   and concise way.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:52.840]   What is legalism referring to?
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.820]   When we're thinking the doctrines
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:58.820]   of the Judaizers, what are we thinking?
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.820]   Yes, in the back.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:02.820]   >> Righteousness by works.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:03.820]   >> Excellent.
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:04.820]   Righteousness by works.
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:05.820]   And I like that.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:09.820]   It's succinct and it comes to hit the main idea
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:11.820]   of what people are seeking.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:14.820]   In the gospel, the gospel begins
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:17.820]   by saying the righteousness of God is revealed.
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:18.820]   Yes?
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:20.820]   How do we attain a righteous standing
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.820]   before God?
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:24.820]   So if you put it in another way,
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.820]   an individual who wants a right standing
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:28.820]   with God to be accepted by God,
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.820]   but does it by their own strength,
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:33.820]   through their own work, for their own glory,
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:35.820]   this is legalism.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.820]   Long time ago, there used to be this brand
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.820]   called FUBU.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.820]   I'm not sure if you guys remember that.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.820]   FUBU, actually, what it represented was
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:45.820]   is for us and by us.
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:47.820]   Now, I'm just going to take that little phrase.
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:50.820]   I don't want to go into the history of all that.
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:52.800]   But if you think about it,
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.800]   legalism just simply means
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.800]   what we're establishing in our religion,
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.800]   in our system of righteousness.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.800]   Who is righteous?
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.800]   Who is scaling this ladder of holiness?
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.800]   It's for us and it's by us.
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.800]   Okay?
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.800]   That's legalism.
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:09.800]   Whereas the gospel says,
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.800]   no, it is accomplished through Christ,
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.800]   it is given through Christ's work,
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.800]   and it is all for the glory of the Lord.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.800]   Okay?
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.800]   And the reason why that's important
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:21.800]   is because when we keep those things in mind then,
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.800]   we're asking the question,
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.800]   how intense is that fight?
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.800]   Is the way that Apostle Paul is reacting,
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:30.800]   is it appropriate?
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.800]   Okay?
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.800]   And especially in our pastors today.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.800]   I don't know if some of you have felt like,
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.800]   whoa, is this like a moment of anger?
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.800]   He's just letting loose some of his words.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:43.800]   Right?
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.800]   But I think what we're going to see is
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:49.800]   that as Apostle Paul over the entirety of the letter
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.800]   has been trying to show the church,
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.800]   look at the comparison and contrast
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.800]   between what God has given to us,
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.800]   the long history of what he has accomplished
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.800]   in giving to us freedom,
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.800]   and then now you're trying to do this?
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.800]   He's not just seeing like,
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.800]   a couple people having different ideas
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.800]   and different thoughts.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.800]   You know, we should try to see a middle ground.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:12.800]   No, no, no.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.800]   He's saying the difference is between freedom and slavery.
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:16.800]   There is no middle ground.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.800]   That was the review, okay?
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.800]   So in today's passage,
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.800]   we're hitting chapter 5, verse 7 through 12.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.800]   And the way that I have broken it up
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.800]   is that in verse 7 through 10,
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.800]   I see him comparing and contrasting.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.800]   Here's you, you began running well.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.800]   And here's you, I have a lot of confidence
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.800]   that God is working in you.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.800]   But then them, right?
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.800]   He's pointing at them.
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.800]   And he's trying to show us
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.800]   that in as much as you need to see the contrast
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.800]   and difference between the systems,
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.800]   between freedom and slavery,
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.800]   he wants you also to have the strength and courage
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:56.800]   to discern the ones who are your opponents,
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.800]   the opposition.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.800]   You have to not only distinguish doctrine,
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.800]   but you have to distinguish people.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.800]   Not very popular and a very relativistic,
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.800]   you know, everybody's all equal kind of society
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.800]   that we live in today,
[01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.800]   but actually the thought, okay?
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.800]   Verse 11, I see as Paul's defense.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.800]   He is not preaching circumcision.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.800]   And verse 12, he says,
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.800]   "I wish that these people who are disturbing you
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.800]   would mutilate themselves."
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.800]   This is his genuine thought about how he feels
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.800]   about those who would threaten the church.
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.800]   So part one, let's take a moment now
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.800]   to walk through this segment, okay?
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.800]   To walk through this segment.
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:41.800]   Here, he just begins and describes
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.800]   you are running well, okay?
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:47.800]   And for that, all I'm going to say is,
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.800]   so you see this contrast.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.800]   Like for you, you're running well,
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.800]   but then who hindered you?
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.800]   And he's asking this question, okay?
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.800]   And then in verse 10, he says,
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.800]   "Although I have confidence in you,
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.800]   but the ones who are disturbing you,
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.800]   this is what's going to happen.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.800]   They're going to bear their judgment."
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.800]   So here's that contrast.
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:09.800]   Back in chapter 3, he described,
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.800]   "You began by the Spirit."
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.800]   And so I want to just put into context,
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.800]   you recall Apostle Paul
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.800]   has knowledge of these people.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.800]   He's seen various spiritual fruits in their lives.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:24.800]   He's remembering how receptive they were, okay?
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.800]   And so there's a genuine sense of disappointment, right?
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.800]   There's a genuine sense of disappointment.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.800]   Now, the point of this first statement in verse 7
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.800]   is not just simply to encourage them
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:38.800]   because the point of it actually is to say,
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.800]   "But right now, you're not obeying the truth."
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.800]   What a very pointed rebuke.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.800]   You're not obeying the truth at all.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.800]   As a matter of fact, what we sense
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.800]   is that they've been very, very hesitant.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.800]   They've even potentially been accusatory,
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.800]   like, "Apostle Paul, why are you against us?"
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.800]   They've been giving a lot of pushback,
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.800]   is the inference, okay?
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.800]   Now, when we think about this question,
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.800]   who hindered you, okay?
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.800]   I want to ask maybe a question
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.800]   that feels a little bit too, like, nitpicky,
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.800]   but to actually ask the question,
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.800]   "Is this a genuine question?"
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.800]   Asking, like, "Who is it?"
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.800]   Like, name him.
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.800]   Or is it more of a rhetorical question?
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.800]   If it is a rhetorical question, we know the point
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.800]   because the point is if you ask a rhetorical question,
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.800]   the answer is no one.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.800]   It's my fault.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.800]   The reason why I'm here, you know,
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.800]   compromised and et cetera,
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.800]   that's totally on us, right?
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.800]   When he says, like, "Who did this to you, huh?"
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.800]   I'm not trying to put tone into it,
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.800]   but if he was, like, a rhetorical question,
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.800]   then that would be the tone,
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.800]   and the answer would be the person.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.800]   We can't give any excuse.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.800]   We're disobeying God's truth, right?
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.800]   But what we know is that there are actually people
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.800]   who are opposing the Church,
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:03.800]   who are trying to do a lot.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.800]   So we ask this question,
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.800]   "What is the opposition doing right now?"
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.800]   And I think this is the emphatic point of the passage
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.800]   that we should take home today, okay?
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.800]   If you think about it, there's this.
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.800]   They're hindering the Church.
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.800]   They are persuading.
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.800]   They are disturbing, okay?
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.800]   And this here, it says--
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.800]   it's just a proverbial, like, a pithy statement
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.800]   about how such a little thing
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:31.800]   can corrupt and influence the whole thing,
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.800]   but essentially, he is pointing out, again,
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.800]   the corruption of these false teachers
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.800]   is affecting the whole Church, right?
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.800]   So I want to talk about that a little bit,
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.800]   just putting it all together.
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.800]   They're hindering the Church, which, if you look that up,
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.800]   it means to try and cut off.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.800]   They're trying to get people to not obey the truth.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.800]   They're persuading and convincing.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.800]   Another synonym for that idea of persuading
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.800]   is they're trying to give false conviction to the Church.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.800]   Just a moment of pause there to think.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.800]   Anybody who is a false teacher
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.800]   that's trying to lead the Church astray
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.800]   isn't typically going to do that with, like,
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.800]   "Yeah, I don't know,"
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.800]   but most often, they're going to do that with,
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.800]   "I have conviction. This is the truth," right?
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.800]   They're going to come at you with,
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.800]   "This is the Word of God," et cetera, et cetera.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:25.800]   They're going to come with a lot of oomph and conviction.
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:28.800]   And then what's more, this idea of disturbing,
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.800]   back here in verse 10,
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.800]   is this--the literal idea is to take somebody
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.800]   and just swing them left and right,
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:36.800]   swing them back and forth.
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:40.800]   It's to discombobulate and confuse an individual, okay?
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:44.800]   These are the many tactics of the opposition.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.800]   Quick question for you, okay?
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.800]   I think we live in a generation
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:54.800]   where the typical idea
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:57.800]   is that most people have good intentions.
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.800]   They just make a lot of mistakes.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:00.800]   But here in this passage,
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.800]   that is not the way that Apostle Paul
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.800]   views false teachers.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.800]   He wants the Church members to know
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.800]   the voice of the rebellious against Christ.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.800]   He wants the Church people to know
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.800]   those who would, you know, blow hot air
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.800]   and just try to have all this, like, emphatic teaching.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:22.800]   He wants you to be able to distinguish between people.
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:24.800]   He wants you to be able to distinguish
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.800]   between those who are safe
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.800]   and those who would swindle you, okay?
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:32.800]   And the question, therefore, to you is,
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.800]   do you--are you able to distinguish, okay?
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.800]   Now, I want to take a moment
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.800]   to ask this question
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:45.800]   about what are the Galatians doing, though, okay?
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.800]   We talked about, hey, we have the opposition
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:50.800]   and they're doing all these different kind of schemes,
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:53.800]   but here it's phrased really interesting
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.800]   to talk about the Church people
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.800]   and that they are currently not--oh, sorry--
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:05.800]   obeying the truth, okay?
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.800]   All right, to not obeying the truth.
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.800]   And there is a moment for us to ask this question.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:13.800]   Well, why?
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.800]   Why is the Church slow to obey the truth?
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.800]   Why is it that they've been so convinced
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:20.800]   of the gospel, they receive Apostle Paul
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.800]   and his preaching well,
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.800]   and then now they turn into, like,
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.800]   "Oh, yeah, let's go ahead and obey the laws of Moses.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.800]   Let's get circumcised," et cetera, et cetera.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.800]   And I have some thoughts for us there,
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.800]   but first and foremost, I want to just have us
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.800]   kind of meditate on that question.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.800]   That could it be that what is at stake right now?
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.800]   In some sense, if you think about even our preaching,
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.780]   we can preach, "Jesus Christ is the Son of God
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.780]   and the way of salvation."
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.780]   Did you know that there's a lot of people who'd be like,
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:57.780]   "Sounds good to me."
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:00.780]   But the moment you say,
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:03.780]   then that means he is the only way,
[01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:06.780]   and that means every other way,
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.780]   whether it's Islam.
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:10.780]   You can acknowledge Jesus as an amazing rabbi,
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:12.780]   the greatest teacher there ever was,
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:14.780]   a prophet of God, et cetera,
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:17.780]   but every other way is wrong except Christ.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:21.780]   That's when you all of a sudden have opposition, right?
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:23.780]   Well, if you think about it,
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:24.780]   what the church was doing in context
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:27.780]   was trying to find a middle ground.
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.780]   So then there is a point of reflection
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:32.780]   and meditation for us.
[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:35.780]   Is there any desire in us
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:37.780]   where we want to maybe mistakenly take
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:39.780]   like a humble approach to truth
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:43.780]   and try and seek like, "Oh, is there a middle ground here?"
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:44.780]   Okay?
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:46.780]   If somebody is teaching falsehood,
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.780]   is there any desire for us to be like,
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:49.780]   "Yeah, you know,
[01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:52.780]   "I never want to be too emphatically on this side.
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:55.780]   "I don't want to be too emphatically on this side for sure.
[01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:58.780]   "I want to try to take like a middle ground."
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:02.780]   That kind of attitude is not humble at all.
[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:04.780]   That kind of attitude God would see as,
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:06.780]   "What are you doing?
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.780]   "Why are you trying to self-preserve?"
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:09.780]   Okay?
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:11.780]   If God tells us certain things like,
[01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:14.780]   "Jesus is the only truth, the only life,
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:17.780]   "and he is the Son of the living God,
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:19.780]   "and you happen to say something to the extent of like,
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:21.780]   "'Yeah, I don't know,' others say,"
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:23.780]   that's not humility.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:24.780]   Right?
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:27.780]   If God said something very clear and explicit in the Scriptures,
[01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:31.780]   we have to come at it with the same explicitness,
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:33.780]   same clarity, same devotion,
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:35.780]   as God would say it.
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:37.780]   Anything less than that
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:41.780]   would actually be the opposite of humility.
[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:43.780]   It would be self-preserving.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:44.780]   Okay.
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.780]   So, in this way,
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:50.780]   I just want to take a moment to think about
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:53.780]   how the Scriptures has an expectation.
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:56.780]   The Gospel call is not just,
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:58.780]   "Here's doctrine.
[01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:00.780]   "I hope you understand."
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.780]   The Gospel call is actually a command.
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:04.780]   You believe and you repent.
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:07.780]   And that's what Christians do from day one
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:08.780]   and every day forward.
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:09.780]   Right?
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.780]   Okay.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:15.780]   I want to move forward into
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.780]   the other just thought,
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:22.780]   which is--let me pass through a couple of these real fast.
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:24.780]   Verse 8, okay?
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:26.780]   In verse 8, you know,
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:28.780]   we don't have to take time to ask like,
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:29.780]   "Oh, what does he really mean by this?"
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:31.780]   because it's really apparent and clear.
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.780]   Apostle Paul is saying,
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:36.780]   "And you know that these false influences,
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:38.780]   "this persuasion, does not come from God."
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:39.780]   Okay?
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.780]   And I want to remind us that
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:44.780]   the admonition and the warning for us
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:46.780]   in this generation--
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:47.780]   I mean, if you think about it,
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:48.780]   this is already, you know,
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:50.780]   the writing of the Scriptures
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:52.780]   is a couple thousand years old.
[01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:55.780]   We are now more than,
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:56.780]   if you think about it,
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:58.780]   affected by this truth
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:00.780]   that there are going to be so many false teachers.
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.780]   Let me read to you 2 Corinthians 11,
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:04.780]   verse 12 through 15.
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:06.780]   "But what am I doing?
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:07.780]   "I will continue to do,
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.780]   "so that I may cut off opportunity
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:12.780]   "from those who desire an opportunity
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.780]   "to be regarded just as we are
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:16.780]   "in the matter about which they are boasting."
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.780]   You see what he's saying, right?
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.780]   If there are people trying to teach you,
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:21.780]   trying to have their way with you,
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:22.780]   I'm going to make sure
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.780]   to cut off that opportunity.
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:25.780]   Yes?
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.780]   Someone may accuse us, the leaders,
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.780]   of like, "Oh, you leaders,
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:30.780]   "you're so arrogant.
[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:32.780]   "You only want to be the people
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:34.780]   "who teach into the church members.
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:35.780]   "Oh, you're so arrogant.
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:37.780]   "You're like the good old boy club.
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:38.760]   "You're not raising up other leaders
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.760]   "and giving people an opportunity
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.760]   "to teach into the church's life."
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.760]   People have said that.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.760]   Well, like Apostle Paul,
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:47.760]   we're going to say, "So be it.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.760]   "Accuse us of what you will.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.760]   "We love our church people,
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.760]   "and we are not giving the pulpit
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.760]   "to anybody or anyone who wishes
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:57.760]   "just to have an opportunity with you."
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:58.760]   Yes?
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:23:59.760]   This is what he says.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:00.760]   Verse 13.
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.760]   "For such men are false apostles,
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:03.760]   "deceitful workers,
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.760]   "disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:08.760]   "No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:09.760]   "as an angel of light.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:11.760]   "Therefore, it is not surprising
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.760]   "if his servants also disguise themselves
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.760]   "as servants of righteousness,
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.760]   "whose end will be according
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.760]   "to their deed."
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:23.760]   So, I want to just make a point with that
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.760]   in verse 8 is, again,
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:27.760]   the leadership of the church
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.760]   has a call to protect the flock.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.760]   But another quick reminder for you,
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:34.760]   every single one of you
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:36.760]   has to see the difference between
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.760]   who is from God and who is not.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:39.760]   Think about this question.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.760]   How well can you discern?
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.760]   And are you actually willing to say
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.760]   that guy is a false teacher?
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.760]   Or do you have this generally
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:49.760]   very, very empathetic heart?
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.760]   You know, they mean well,
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.760]   they're good people,
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.760]   they just said something wrong.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.760]   That's an admonition to you.
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.760]   Next.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.760]   Within this, we have this,
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.760]   you know, principle of life,
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:02.760]   I like to call it.
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:04.760]   Sometimes the scriptures gives us
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:05.760]   principles for living,
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:06.760]   kind of pithy statements
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.760]   in wisdom proverbs.
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:09.760]   And in verse 9 it says,
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.760]   "A little leaven leavens
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.760]   "the whole lump of dough."
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:14.760]   And we asked a simple question
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.760]   of what does the leaven represent?
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:18.760]   And you guys probably know
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:19.760]   right off the bat
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:20.760]   from other parts of scripture
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:21.760]   where Jesus says,
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:22.760]   "Beware the leaven of the Pharisees."
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.760]   The yeast of the Pharisees, right?
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.760]   It's the false teaching.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.760]   And the other principle
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:29.760]   that is embedded in this
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:30.760]   is this thought,
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.760]   "A little error
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.760]   "has incredible consequences."
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:35.760]   Yes?
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.760]   "A little contamination
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:40.760]   "can ruin the whole thing."
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.760]   The thought of it here is
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.760]   that there is no way
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:45.760]   for us to say,
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:48.760]   "Yes, this has a little leaven in it,
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:49.760]   "and once it's risen,
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:51.760]   "let's try to salvage this thing
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:52.760]   "by separating."
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:53.760]   You can't, it's already done.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:54.760]   It's already baked
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:55.760]   into the whole system.
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.760]   Does that make sense?
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:57.760]   Okay.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.760]   In thinking about that then,
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.760]   we can move to just a quick,
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.740]   quick application of our attitude.
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:04.740]   How will you respond
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:05.740]   if someone comes in here
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:06.740]   and says, "You know what?
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:08.740]   "You guys are straight legalists.
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.740]   "You guys just try to dot every I,
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:11.740]   "cross every T.
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:12.740]   "You guys try to think
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:13.740]   "that you're so holy
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:15.740]   "by doing everything right."
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:18.740]   How would you respond to that?
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.740]   We should respond with,
[01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:21.740]   "The scriptures
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:24.740]   "has such an admonition for us.
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:26.740]   "Whether it's topics of baptism,
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:27.740]   "whether it's topics
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.740]   "of interpretation,
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:30.740]   "every single one of us,
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:31.740]   "if we are trying
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:34.740]   "to be faithful to Christ,
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:35.740]   "we should have an attitude of,
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:36.740]   "Dude, even if I have
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:37.740]   "a little thing wrong,
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:38.740]   "I would change that
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.740]   "for the Lord."
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:41.740]   Right?
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:42.740]   Why would I complain
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:43.740]   to my Lord Jesus Christ like,
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:44.740]   "Oh, you want me
[01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:45.740]   "to change that too?
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:46.740]   "This too?
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.740]   "Jesus, you're so legalist."
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:49.740]   That is completely
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:51.740]   the wrong attitude to have.
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:52.740]   It is actually good
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.740]   to think in every way,
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:56.740]   in every facet of my life,
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:58.740]   "Here it is, Lord.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:26:59.740]   "I'm a total open book,
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:02.740]   "and whatever you reveal to me,
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:03.740]   "no matter how long
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:04.740]   "I've been doing it,
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:05.740]   "no matter how many people,
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.740]   "the majority are doing it,
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:09.740]   "I'm going to do it right."
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:10.740]   That's the right attitude.
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:11.740]   Amen?
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:12.740]   Okay.
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:14.740]   Now, with that said,
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:15.740]   I do want to share
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:16.740]   with you guys
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:18.740]   that with this whole thought,
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:21.740]   like, have there been,
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:22.740]   have there been certain attacks
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:24.740]   against the church
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.740]   where little, little faucets
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:28.740]   have come in?
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:29.740]   There have been.
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:30.740]   You know, there,
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:31.740]   just in recent history,
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:32.740]   we've had to fight
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:33.740]   like this thought like,
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:35.740]   you know, the Old Testament,
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:37.740]   not as reliable as the New.
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:38.740]   I could totally accept the New,
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:39.740]   but the Old Testament
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.740]   doesn't seem inerrant.
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:42.740]   Should we allow people like that
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:45.740]   to join our membership?
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:46.740]   I'm just asking you now
[01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:48.740]   a very practical question.
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:49.740]   If you are in charge
[01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:50.740]   of who do we allow
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:52.740]   to be a part of the members?
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:53.740]   If somebody had
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:54.740]   a free grace theology,
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:55.740]   which was, you know,
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.740]   once you confess Jesus as Lord,
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:58.740]   you're good for life.
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:27:59.740]   Even if you fall away
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:00.740]   from the church,
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:01.740]   you never go,
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:02.740]   you denounce the faith,
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:03.740]   you're good.
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:04.740]   Why?
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:05.740]   Because you believed
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:06.740]   at one point.
[01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:07.740]   Should we allow that person
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:08.740]   into the church?
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:09.740]   We've had that.
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:10.740]   You know, there was
[01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:11.740]   a scenario one time
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:12.740]   when I was out
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:13.740]   in the courtyard
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:14.740]   and Pastor Peter Chung,
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:15.740]   he just had like bright eyes
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:16.740]   and he beelined
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:17.740]   towards this one new individual
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:18.740]   because that individual
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:19.740]   was going around
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:21.740]   challenging our church people.
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:22.740]   Did you know
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:23.740]   that you're saying
[01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:24.740]   Jesus' name wrong
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:25.740]   because you're in sin?
[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:27.740]   You're supposed to say Yeshua.
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:28.740]   And then he motioned
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:29.740]   over at me,
[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:30.740]   there's more of these guys.
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:31.740]   He pointed another one at me
[01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:32.740]   so I said, okay,
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:33.740]   so Pastor Peter Chung
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:34.740]   got one person,
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:35.740]   I got another person
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:36.740]   and we know everyone out there
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:37.740]   and we're like,
[01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:38.740]   what are you doing?
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:39.740]   And they were preaching like,
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:40.740]   we love everything you do,
[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:42.740]   we're Bereans too,
[01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:43.740]   but you're in sin
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:44.740]   because you're not saying
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:45.740]   Jesus' name right
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:47.740]   and therefore you're falling.
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.740]   Scripture says in Acts 4,
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:50.740]   there's only one name
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:51.740]   by which you must be saved.
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:52.740]   And I was sitting there like,
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:54.740]   what is this?
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:55.720]   Right?
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:56.720]   What is this?
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.720]   And then I argued with him like,
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:28:59.720]   dude, you do understand
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:00.720]   that even the way
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:02.720]   you say it is wrong
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:03.720]   because in Hebrew,
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:05.720]   yes, it's Yeshua
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:07.720]   but there's vowel pointings
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.720]   that was placed
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:09.720]   by the Masoretes
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:10.720]   and in my Greek Bible,
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:11.720]   it's Jesus
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.720]   because it's translated
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:14.720]   and now I'm going to accuse you
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:15.720]   of racism
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:17.720]   because I'm Korean.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.720]   Right?
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.720]   Because in my Korean translation,
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:22.720]   it's Yesvinim.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:24.720]   Am I wrong?
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:25.700]   Right?
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:26.700]   And he was kind of like,
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:27.700]   huh.
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:28.700]   I was like,
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:29.700]   so you're going to tell me
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:30.700]   all 50 million Koreans
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:31.700]   who are in the--
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:32.700]   right?
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:33.700]   Like when they say Jesus' name,
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:35.700]   they're just wrong and sinful
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:36.700]   and he was like,
[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:38.700]   I never thought about that.
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:39.700]   And I was like,
[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:41.700]   dude, this is the epitome
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:44.700]   of self-righteous false teaching.
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:45.700]   This conviction like,
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.700]   we have the name of Jesus.
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:48.700]   Right?
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:50.700]   And there are people like that
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:51.700]   who enter into our church.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:52.700]   Praise God
[01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:53.700]   that Pastor Peter Chung
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:54.700]   caught them early on
[01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:55.700]   and said,
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:56.700]   dude, you're not allowed
[01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:57.700]   to talk to anybody at church.
[01:29:57.700 --> 01:29:58.700]   If you want to talk,
[01:29:58.700 --> 01:29:59.700]   you come talk to one of the leaders,
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:01.700]   get off this campus.
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:03.700]   That's what he said.
[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:04.700]   Praise God we can--
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:05.700]   we have the wherewithal
[01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:06.700]   to do that
[01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:07.700]   but sometimes
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:08.700]   what I see
[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:10.700]   is this desire
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:11.700]   to be like,
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:12.700]   oh, you know,
[01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:14.700]   like do we want to really divide
[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:16.700]   and cut lines everywhere?
[01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:17.700]   We should
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:18.700]   because that kind of thing
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:21.700]   breeds self-righteousness.
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:22.700]   Okay.
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:25.700]   So today
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:26.700]   what you're feeling
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.700]   is the passage to us
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:30.700]   gave such hard--
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:32.700]   like hard line warning.
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:33.700]   There are these false teachers
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:35.700]   who are after us.
[01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:37.700]   And in 2 Peter 2:1-3
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:38.700]   it says,
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:39.700]   "But false prophets
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.700]   also arose among the people,
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:42.700]   just as there will also be
[01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:44.700]   false teachers among you
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:45.700]   who will secretly introduce
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:47.700]   destructive heresies,
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:48.700]   even denying the Master
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:49.700]   who bought them,
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:50.700]   bringing swift destruction
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:51.700]   upon themselves.
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:52.700]   Many will follow
[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:53.700]   after their sensuality.
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:54.700]   Because of them
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:55.700]   the way of truth
[01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:56.700]   will be maligned
[01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:57.700]   and in their greed
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:58.700]   they will exploit you
[01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:00.700]   with false words.
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:01.700]   Their judgment from long ago
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:02.700]   is not idle
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.700]   and their destruction
[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:06.700]   is not asleep."
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:07.700]   Okay.
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:09.700]   I want to take this moment
[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:11.700]   to give us this challenge.
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:13.700]   Jesus in Book of Revelation
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:14.700]   when he is confronting
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:15.700]   the churches
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:18.700]   he specifically highlights,
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:19.700]   you know,
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:20.700]   one of the seven churches
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:22.700]   a church in Pergamum
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:23.700]   which is in modern day
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:24.700]   like Turkey.
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:25.700]   Okay.
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:26.700]   And he says
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:27.700]   to the angel
[01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:28.700]   of the church in Pergamum,
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:29.700]   write,
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:30.700]   "The one who has
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:31.700]   a sharp two-edged sword
[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:32.700]   says this,
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:33.700]   'I know where you dwell,
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:35.700]   where Satan's throne is,
[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:36.700]   and you hold fast my name
[01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:38.700]   and did not deny my faith
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:40.700]   even in the days of Antipas,
[01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:41.700]   my witness,
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:42.700]   my faithful one,
[01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:43.700]   who was killed among you
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:44.700]   where Satan dwells.'"
[01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:45.700]   Pause.
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:46.700]   He's commending them
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:47.700]   because they are in
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.700]   the epitome of pagan idolatry
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:50.700]   there's so much
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:52.700]   paganism going on
[01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:53.700]   and he says
[01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:54.700]   "And you haven't folded."
[01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:55.700]   Good.
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:56.700]   But then look at
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:57.700]   what he says.
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:58.700]   Verse 14,
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:31:59.700]   "But I have a few things
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:00.700]   against you
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:01.700]   because you have there
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:02.700]   some who hold the teachings
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:03.700]   of Balaam
[01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:07.700]   who kept teaching Balak
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:08.700]   to put a stumbling block
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:09.700]   before the sons of Israel
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:10.700]   to eat things
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:11.700]   sacrificed to idols
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:12.700]   and to commit acts
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:13.700]   of immorality.
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:15.700]   So you also have some
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:16.700]   in the same way
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:17.700]   hold the teachings
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:18.700]   of the Nicolaitans.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.700]   Therefore repent
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:21.700]   or else I am coming
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:22.700]   to you quickly
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:24.700]   and I will make war against them
[01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:26.700]   with the sword of my mouth."
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:27.700]   Wow.
[01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:29.700]   What does he say?
[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:30.700]   He says
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:31.700]   "I commend you
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:32.700]   because you haven't folded
[01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:33.700]   but you've tolerated
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:34.700]   false teaching
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:35.700]   in your midst
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:36.700]   and this toleration
[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:38.700]   has led to licentiousness,
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:39.700]   immorality
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:40.700]   and people still performing
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:42.700]   whatever was in their flesh.
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:46.700]   Now I go to war with you."
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:47.700]   That's scary.
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:48.700]   Okay.
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:49.700]   So in summary
[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:50.700]   of that first section
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:51.700]   the opposition
[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:52.700]   is hindering you
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:53.700]   from obeying,
[01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:54.700]   persuading you
[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:55.700]   of false convictions,
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:56.700]   disturbing you
[01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:57.700]   with convictions.
[01:32:57.700 --> 01:32:58.700]   Their source is not
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:32:59.700]   from God
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:00.700]   but their own flesh,
[01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:01.700]   their own might
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:02.700]   and all that stuff.
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.700]   They're ruining all
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:04.700]   with a little bit
[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:05.700]   of themselves
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:06.700]   but ultimately
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:07.700]   they will be judged.
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:08.700]   Have confidence.
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:09.700]   If ever you feel like
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:10.700]   oh my gosh
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:11.700]   the state of the church
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:12.700]   is so crazy
[01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:13.700]   there is still
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:15.700]   this conviction.
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:16.700]   God is Lord of the church.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:17.700]   Amen.
[01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:18.700]   And so earlier
[01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:20.700]   in verse 10
[01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:21.700]   he says I have
[01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:22.700]   this confidence
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:25.700]   in you
[01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:26.700]   but ultimately
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:27.700]   in the Lord.
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:28.700]   He who began a good work
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:29.700]   is going to see to it
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:30.700]   and the church
[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:31.700]   is going to remain
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:32.700]   because God is able
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:33.700]   to keep it.
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:35.700]   Amen.
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:36.700]   The next two portions
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.700]   are just really quick.
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:39.700]   This one
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:40.700]   it says
[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:41.700]   but I brethren
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:43.700]   if I still preach circumcision
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:45.700]   why am I still persecuted?
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:46.700]   Then the stumbling block
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:47.700]   of the cross
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:48.700]   has been abolished.
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:49.700]   This one may read
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:50.700]   a little funny
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:51.700]   but what you have to do
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:52.700]   is kind of read it
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:53.700]   in context.
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:54.700]   You know
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:55.700]   that Apostle Paul
[01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:56.700]   was one
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:58.700]   who was Jew of Jew.
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:33:59.700]   Okay.
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:00.700]   And so I can imagine
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:01.700]   someone saying
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:02.700]   dude that guy
[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:04.700]   he preached Judaism.
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:05.700]   That guy was
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:06.700]   the greatest apostatizer
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:08.700]   of the Jewish faith.
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:09.700]   Right.
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:10.700]   Jewish faith.
[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:12.700]   That guy preaches circumcision
[01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:13.700]   and what's more
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:14.700]   we've heard
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:15.700]   this guy Timothy.
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:16.700]   So my guess is
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:17.700]   there were people
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:18.700]   accusing him
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:20.700]   this guy is a hypocrite.
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:21.700]   Right.
[01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:22.700]   I call this
[01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:24.700]   Apostle Paul's defense
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:25.700]   because the question is
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:27.700]   did Paul ever preach it?
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:28.700]   And the answer is
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:30.700]   in his pre-converted state.
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:31.700]   Right.
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:33.700]   But what he's saying is
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:35.700]   if I still preach
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:37.700]   then why am I still persecuted?
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:38.700]   Of course
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:40.700]   I don't preach circumcision.
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:41.700]   The reason why
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:42.700]   I'm being persecuted
[01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:43.700]   is because I don't
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:44.700]   preach Christ
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:45.700]   the stumbling block
[01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:46.700]   to the Jews.
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:48.700]   If I preach circumcision
[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:49.700]   then
[01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:50.700]   the stumbling block
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:51.700]   of cross would be abolished
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:52.700]   and it would be easy
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:54.700]   there would be an easy way out
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:55.700]   out of all this turmoil
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:56.700]   of all the stuff
[01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:58.700]   I'm stirring up right now
[01:34:58.700 --> 01:34:59.700]   if I just let it be.
[01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:00.700]   Okay.
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:02.700]   That's verse 11.
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:04.700]   But here verse 12
[01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:05.700]   this is the one
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:06.700]   where it's again
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:07.700]   maybe a little bit
[01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.700]   unsettling.
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:10.700]   I asked this question
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:11.700]   Apostle Paul says
[01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:12.700]   I wish that those
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:13.700]   around you
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:15.700]   would even mutilate themselves.
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:16.700]   Okay.
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:18.700]   Is this the moment of anger?
[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:19.700]   Is this verbiage
[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:21.700]   too harsh?
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:22.700]   Okay.
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:23.700]   Is this something
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:24.700]   that we should feel ourselves?
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:25.700]   Is this kind of like
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:27.700]   a model attitude for us
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:28.700]   or should we be like
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:30.700]   no no that's an apostle thing.
[01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:31.700]   That's not an us
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:33.700]   in our modern day church thing.
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:34.700]   Okay.
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:35.700]   And this is kind of
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.700]   where I'll just wrap things up.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:38.700]   I think you guys know
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:39.700]   when he says
[01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:40.700]   to mutilate themselves
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:42.700]   he is talking about
[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:44.680]   full-blown castration
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:45.680]   demasculating
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:47.680]   and amputation.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.680]   He's saying
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:49.680]   if you're going to mutilate yourself
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:50.680]   just go all the way.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.680]   Right.
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:54.680]   Now in that sense
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.680]   this is really intense
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:58.680]   and the word itself
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:00.680]   he could have just said
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:01.680]   the word to amputate
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:03.680]   but he uses a compound word
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.680]   to be very emphatic.
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:07.680]   Okay.
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:08.680]   So then in thinking
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:09.680]   through that
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.680]   what is he doing?
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:13.680]   Is he just in an argumentative tone
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:14.680]   being sarcastic
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:15.680]   and be like
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.680]   if you're going to cut
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:17.680]   just do it
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.680]   and he's speaking
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:20.680]   in that kind of tone.
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:21.680]   Well I think
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.680]   there's a couple of things
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:25.680]   I want to say about that is
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:26.680]   I believe Apostle Paul
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.680]   what he's saying is
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:28.680]   I wish
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:29.680]   that they would be
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:30.680]   cut off
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.680]   from the community.
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.680]   If you remember he said
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:35.680]   earlier the separation
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:36.680]   from the free man
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:38.680]   to the slave
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:39.680]   there has to be
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:41.680]   a removal of the slave child.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:42.680]   Right.
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:43.680]   In order for there
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:44.680]   to actually be freedom
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:45.680]   there has to be
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:46.680]   such a distinction
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:47.680]   and what he's saying is
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:48.680]   I wish that these people
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.680]   would go.
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:51.680]   Right.
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:52.680]   Why?
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:53.680]   Because of course
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:54.680]   it's ten times worse
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:55.680]   to have somebody
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:56.680]   who believes
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.680]   that he is a Christian
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:58.680]   who believes
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:36:59.680]   and wants to be a leader
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.680]   amongst Christians
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:02.680]   to be in the midst
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:03.680]   of the church
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:05.680]   trying to gain persuasion.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:07.680]   That's ten times worse.
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:08.680]   Right.
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:09.680]   If you have somebody
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:10.680]   who is Buddhist
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:11.680]   and they say
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:12.680]   yeah you know
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:13.680]   we believe in Buddhism
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:14.680]   but they're completely
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:15.680]   outside of the church
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.680]   we can clearly distinguish.
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.680]   But these people
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:19.680]   who come in
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.680]   to scope out the liberty
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:22.680]   of the flock
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:23.680]   to put them back
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:24.680]   into bondage
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:25.680]   Apostle Paul
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.680]   then appropriately
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:27.680]   feels this way.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:28.680]   And the way
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:29.680]   I'm going to conclude is
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:34.680]   this is the appropriate sentiment.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:35.680]   We live in a generation
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:36.680]   where people
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:38.680]   will be mad at you
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:39.660]   for showing any kind
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:42.660]   of self-righteous indignation
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:43.660]   and rightly so
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:44.660]   because you shouldn't
[01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:45.660]   be self-righteous.
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:46.660]   But does that mean
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:48.660]   that every form of anger
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:51.660]   is self-righteous?
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:52.660]   No.
[01:37:52.660 --> 01:37:53.660]   You guys remember
[01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:54.660]   back in the day
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:55.660]   Phinehas
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:56.660]   Phinehas
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:57.660]   I'm not sure exactly
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:58.660]   how to pronounce it
[01:37:58.660 --> 01:37:59.660]   but when in the temple
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:01.660]   in the worship
[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:02.660]   while Moses
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:03.660]   and the elders were praying
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:04.660]   there was a man
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:05.660]   who would take
[01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:06.660]   a pagan woman
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:07.660]   and sleep with her
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.660]   in the viewing of all.
[01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:11.660]   So this man took a spear
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:12.660]   and drove through
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:13.660]   both of them
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:14.660]   and the zeal of the Lord
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:16.660]   moved him to do that.
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:17.660]   Why?
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:18.660]   Because the audacity
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:19.660]   of sin
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:20.660]   was before the face
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:23.660]   of the elders and God.
[01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:25.660]   What did God say?
[01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:26.660]   This man's loyalty
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:27.660]   is with me.
[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:28.660]   This generation
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:29.660]   will hate you
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:30.660]   and be angry with you
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:31.660]   for showing your loyalty
[01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:32.660]   to Christ
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:33.660]   loyalty to your family
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:35.660]   and loyalty to your church.
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:37.660]   Do not let this pagan world
[01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:38.640]   silence
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:41.640]   your righteous indignation.
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:42.640]   Why?
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:43.640]   Because you're supposed
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:45.640]   to love Christ.
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:46.640]   You're supposed to love
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:47.640]   your family.
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:48.640]   You're supposed to love
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:49.640]   your church.
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:51.640]   And Apostle Paul says
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:52.640]   it is only right for me
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.640]   to feel this way about you.
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:56.640]   He loved these people
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:57.640]   and any person
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:58.640]   who comes in
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:38:59.640]   I mean
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:00.640]   if you imagine
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:04.640]   a vicious, greedy, violent
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.640]   uncontrolled man
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.640]   trying to run a business
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:07.640]   out there
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:08.640]   okay
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:09.640]   it's a cutthroat world
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:10.640]   out there
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:11.640]   run your business
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:12.640]   but then he comes
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:13.640]   into your house
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:14.640]   expecting to be
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:16.640]   the CEO of your home
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:17.640]   and we're supposed
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:18.640]   to be like
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:19.640]   ah you know
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:20.640]   acceptance for all
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:22.640]   give him a chance
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:24.640]   no
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:26.640]   not at all
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:28.640]   you're going to feel
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:29.640]   right
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:30.640]   the distinction
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:31.640]   the judgment
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:32.640]   and the appropriate
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:33.640]   indignation
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:35.640]   of the church.
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:37.640]   So
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:38.640]   I don't think
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:39.640]   this is too harsh.
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:40.640]   I don't think
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:41.640]   this is Apostle Paul
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.640]   being out of line.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:44.640]   I think it's him
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:45.640]   being loyal
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:46.640]   to the Savior.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:47.640]   Amen.
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:48.640]   I'm going to close off
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.640]   with a certain verse
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:50.640]   because I don't want
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.640]   you guys to think that
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:53.640]   okay now it's time
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:56.640]   to go be vigilantes.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:57.640]   We are not supposed
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:59.640]   to go and mutilate people
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:00.640]   and we're not supposed
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:01.640]   to go and
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.640]   cast judgment
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:04.640]   on everybody.
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:05.640]   Turn your Bibles over
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:06.640]   to Jude chapter
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:07.640]   verse 11 through 12
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:09.640]   it's just one chapter.
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:10.640]   11 through
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:11.640]   I'm going to actually
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:14.640]   read the whole section.
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:16.640]   Jude 11 through 21
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:17.640]   okay
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:20.640]   and then we'll wrap up there.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:21.640]   It says
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:23.640]   Jude 11
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:24.640]   "Woe to them
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:25.640]   for they have gone
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:26.640]   the way of Cain
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.640]   and for pay
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.640]   they have rushed headlong
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.640]   into the air of Balaam
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:30.640]   and perished
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:31.640]   in the rebellion
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:32.640]   of Korah.
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:33.640]   These are the men
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:34.640]   who are hidden reefs
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:35.640]   in your love feast
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:36.640]   when they feast
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:37.640]   with you without fear
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.640]   caring for themselves
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.640]   clouds without water
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:40.640]   carried along by winds
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:41.640]   autumn trees
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.640]   without fruit
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:43.640]   doubly dead
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:44.640]   uprooted wild waves
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:45.640]   of the sea
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:46.640]   casting up their own
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:47.640]   shame like foam
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:48.640]   wandering stars
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:49.640]   for whom the black darkness
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:51.640]   has been reserved forever.
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:52.640]   It was also
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:53.640]   about these men
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:54.640]   that Enoch
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:55.640]   in the seventh generation
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:56.640]   from Adam prophesied
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:57.640]   saying behold
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:58.640]   the Lord came
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:40:59.640]   with many thousands
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:00.640]   of his holy ones
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:01.640]   to execute judgment
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:02.640]   upon all
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:03.640]   to convict all the ungodly
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:05.640]   of all their ungodly deeds
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:06.640]   what they had done
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:07.640]   in an ungodly way
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.640]   and all the harsh things
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.640]   which ungodly sinners
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:12.640]   have spoken against him.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:14.640]   These are grumblers
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:15.640]   grumblers
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:17.640]   finding fault
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:18.640]   following after
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:19.640]   their own lusts
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.640]   they speak arrogantly
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:22.640]   flattering people
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:23.640]   for the sake
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:24.640]   of gaining an advantage."
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:25.640]   There you have
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:26.640]   from scripture
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:27.640]   certain categories
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:28.640]   that will help you distinguish
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:30.640]   who are the false teachers.
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:31.640]   Verse 17
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:32.640]   "But you beloved
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:33.640]   ought to remember
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:34.640]   the words that are spoken
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.640]   beforehand by the apostles
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:37.640]   of our Lord Jesus Christ
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:38.640]   that they were saying
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:39.640]   to you in the last time
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.640]   there will be mockers
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:41.640]   following after
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:43.640]   their own ungodly lusts.
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:44.640]   These are the ones
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.640]   who cause divisions
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:46.640]   worldly minded
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.640]   devoid of the spirit
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:50.640]   but you beloved
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:51.640]   building yourself up
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:52.640]   in the most holy faith
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.640]   praying in the Holy Spirit
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.640]   keep yourselves
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:57.640]   in the love of God
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:58.640]   waiting anxiously
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.640]   for the mercy of our Lord
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:00.640]   Jesus Christ
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:02.640]   to eternal life."
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:03.640]   Amen.
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:05.640]   Let's pray.
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:07.640]   Heavenly Father
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:08.640]   I pray God
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:09.640]   that you would help us
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:11.640]   be strong
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:12.640]   in a wicked
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:14.640]   and perverse generation.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.640]   I pray Father God
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:16.640]   that we would not lean
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:17.640]   to the right or to the left
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:18.640]   but rather
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:19.640]   help us to stay
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:21.640]   so centered on Christ.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:23.640]   I pray Father God
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:25.640]   that as this passage said
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:26.640]   help us not to give in
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.640]   but rather
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:30.640]   cling so closely
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:31.620]   to the hope
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:32.620]   that we have in Christ
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.620]   looking forward to him
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:35.620]   that in this way
[01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:37.620]   help us to be preserved.
[01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:38.620]   I ask God
[01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:39.620]   that you would help us
[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:40.620]   to be wise
[01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:41.620]   and discerning
[01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:43.620]   for there are many voices
[01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:44.620]   but I pray Lord
[01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:45.620]   that you would grant
[01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:46.620]   to us wisdom.
[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:47.620]   I pray God
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:48.620]   that you would grant
[01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:49.620]   to us strength.
[01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:50.620]   We pray this in Christ's name.
[01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:51.620]   Amen.
[01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:54.620]   Okay.
[01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:55.620]   We're going to go ahead
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:56.620]   and have some announcements
[01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:57.620]   for the events
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:13.620]   coming up.
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:18.620]   Just to start off
[01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:19.620]   just we had a busy week
[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:20.620]   last week
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:21.620]   and it's such an encouragement
[01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:23.620]   to see the whole
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:24.620]   like pretty much
[01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:26.620]   the whole church serving
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:27.620]   on a very wet
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:29.620]   and crazy Sunday
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:31.620]   but just
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:32.620]   it was a blessing
[01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:33.620]   just to see our church
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:35.620]   just moving
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:36.620]   and ministering
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:37.620]   to people all week
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:39.620]   and so
[01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:40.620]   much appreciation
[01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:42.620]   just for
[01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:43.620]   just extending your love
[01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:45.620]   to all the newcomers
[01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:47.620]   on Sunday.
[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:49.620]   I hope you had a good week.
[01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:50.620]   We have a couple things
[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:51.620]   that are coming up.
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:52.620]   Next Saturday
[01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:55.620]   is the Women's Conference.
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:57.620]   There's a lot of information
[01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:00.620]   online
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:01.620]   and we'll go
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:02.620]   into more detailed announcements
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:04.620]   this coming Sunday
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:05.620]   but it always helps
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:06.620]   to know how many people
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:07.620]   are coming
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:08.620]   so we can set up
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:09.620]   like enough chairs
[01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:10.620]   and refreshments and stuff
[01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:11.620]   so if you're planning on coming
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:13.620]   and you haven't signed up yet
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:15.620]   and you're a lady
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:17.620]   please do so
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:19.620]   via the QR codes
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:21.620]   and the stuff that you'll see
[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:23.620]   the links that you'll see online.
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:24.620]   A couple important things
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.620]   remember the 21st
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:27.620]   we have a members meeting
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:29.620]   and that's mandatory
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:31.620]   and we only have
[01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:32.620]   four per year
[01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:33.620]   and this year we have
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:34.620]   for this one
[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:35.620]   there's going to be
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:36.620]   a service team fair
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:38.620]   and so with the service team fair
[01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:39.620]   you can see
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:40.620]   what our church is doing
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:41.620]   and also the areas
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:43.620]   where you can get plugged in
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:44.620]   and the areas
[01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:45.620]   that we actually
[01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:47.620]   really need a lot of help in
[01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:50.620]   so that's on the 21st.
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:51.620]   That same day
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:52.620]   earlier in the morning
[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:53.620]   if you are here
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:54.620]   in our church
[01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:55.620]   but you're not a member
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:56.620]   but you really
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:57.620]   want to
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:59.620]   just join our church
[01:44:59.620 --> 01:45:00.620]   community
[01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:02.620]   there's an eight week course
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:04.620]   that starts on that Sunday
[01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:05.620]   so please
[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:07.620]   prioritize that
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:08.620]   because you're going to need
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.620]   to take this class
[01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:11.620]   in order to become a member.
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:12.620]   The praise and prayer
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.620]   is April 26th
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:16.620]   so kind of keep that in mind
[01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:17.620]   and that announcement
[01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:18.620]   will go out
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:19.620]   just in a couple weeks
[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:21.620]   when we don't have bible study
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:23.620]   but here's an important one
[01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:24.600]   May 4th
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.600]   between 9 to 12
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:27.600]   we've been announcing
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.600]   this for a while
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:30.600]   but as abortion
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:31.600]   birth control
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:32.600]   and IVF
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.600]   are very sensitive
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:35.600]   topics
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.600]   but we want to have
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.600]   every person at our church
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:42.600]   able to articulate
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:43.600]   and biblically
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:44.600]   understand
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:46.600]   just how to process
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:47.600]   through
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:49.600]   these sensitive matters
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:50.600]   regardless of what stage
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:52.600]   of life you're in.
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:53.600]   That's going to be
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:54.600]   happening on that day
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.600]   it's going to be
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.600]   two parts
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:57.600]   with Pastor James Lee
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.600]   from Cross Life
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.600]   walking us through
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.600]   and he's done a lot of research
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.600]   and a lot of careful
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:04.600]   study
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:05.600]   on these things
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:06.600]   and so
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:07.600]   please don't miss it
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:08.600]   but we also need
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:09.600]   kind of a head count
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:11.600]   for different purposes
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:12.600]   and for child care
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:15.600]   so if you guys can
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:16.600]   don't just show up
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:18.600]   like sign up
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:19.600]   so that we can kind of
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:20.600]   prepare for you
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:21.600]   okay
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:22.600]   and then the sign ups
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:23.600]   are all online
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:24.600]   and then on Sunday
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:25.600]   if you guys are not
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:26.600]   as tech savvy
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:27.600]   there's always going to be
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:28.600]   a table
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:36.600]   right outside
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:39.600]   the
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.600]   (laughter)
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:42.600]   there will be a table
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:43.600]   right outside the doors
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.600]   after each service
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:46.600]   or you can
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:47.600]   do this right now
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:48.600]   I'll give you about
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:49.600]   like four seconds
[01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:51.600]   okay
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:52.600]   and while you're
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:54.600]   trying to do this
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:55.600]   right now the time
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:57.600]   is 844
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:58.600]   we're going to go into
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.600]   a time of discussion
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:01.600]   but just remember
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:02.600]   that the shuttle service
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:04.600]   will end at 10 o'clock
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:05.600]   so if you've parked
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:06.600]   farther away
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:07.600]   but you want a fellowship
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:08.600]   with people here
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:09.600]   go get your car
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:10.600]   bring it to the slot
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:14.600]   and then
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:15.600]   proceed with the fellowship
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:16.600]   afterwards
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:17.600]   so that our people can go
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.600]   our shuttle service
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:19.600]   they can go home
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:21.600]   the shuttle people
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:23.600]   really are serving
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:24.600]   very passionately
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:25.600]   for our church
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.600]   right
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:27.600]   and so when you guys
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:28.600]   get an opportunity
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:29.600]   please do thank them
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:30.600]   because they are
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:31.600]   really running around
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:32.600]   trying to make sure
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:33.600]   that we're all getting
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:34.600]   to our car safely
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:35.600]   especially those
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:36.600]   who have been parked
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:37.600]   far away
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:38.600]   okay
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:40.600]   the discussion questions
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.600]   are here
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:43.600]   go ahead
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:44.600]   and take a photo of it
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:45.600]   go ahead
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:47.600]   and just look over it
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:49.600]   and then
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:51.600]   we'll formally
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:52.600]   wrap up with a time
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:53.600]   of discussion
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:54.600]   and prayer
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:57.580]   (silence)
[01:47:57.580 --> 01:48:00.560]   (silence)
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:04.540]   (silence)
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:08.520]   (silence)
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:12.500]   (silence)
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:15.500]   (silence)
[01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:18.500]   (silence)
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:21.500]   (silence)
[01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:24.500]   (silence)
