[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.640]   Alright everyone, we're going to gather our attention up here.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:23.440]   Earlier I made that announcement about the coronavirus and if you kind of got the sentiment,
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.120]   we're neither making it a nothing deal and we're also neither making it like everything
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.960]   that is consuming our minds, right?
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.240]   But one thing I do want to make mention of the fact that is right now things are fast
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.520]   developing the tenor of how things have been developing since even Sunday till now, which
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.360]   is Wednesday, a couple days, it's changed.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.000]   And so please know that if there are major changes, it could possibly be that let's say
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.320]   our format of Bible study changes.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.600]   We will make sure to update you guys and make sure we communicate broadly about that, okay?
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.800]   So let's take a moment to review and then I'll read the passage and we can jump in,
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.800]   okay?
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.800]   So it's about 855.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.040]   Reviewing this part's not on your packet, but remember there is so much to be said in
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.560]   Ephesians chapter 2 verses 1 through 10 and the last section of it was man, like, look
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.160]   what God has done in salvation.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.680]   He made us alive in Christ.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.260]   He raised us with Christ.
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.480]   He seated us with Christ and God's desire is to show, like, put on magnificent display
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.040]   his kindness towards us in Christ, the love that he has shown to us, okay?
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.280]   And so by review, the whole section, verses 1 through 10, showed us an incredible contrast,
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.280]   okay?
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.220]   On one side, you're absolutely dead in your transgressions and sins and you're absolutely
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.440]   oppressed by the forces all around you and the force of your own flesh.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.160]   God has, but in God's mercy, he has made you alive and raised and seated us with Christ.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.960]   Similarly then, in this passage, verses 11 all the way down through verse 22, but we
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:17.120]   cut it off a little bit early, is this amazing contrast of salvation again, but it highlights
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.480]   for us something different.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.840]   Whereas the previous section highlighted for us this absolute truth that you went from
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.920]   death to life, what a vast, vast contrast of reality that you would go from death to
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.000]   living, here and now, Apostle Paul is highlighting for us our salvation where we go from far
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.600]   to near.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   Whereas one side, it is your existence and your reality before God, here and now, he
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.260]   makes it very personal.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.600]   This is the relational contrast of the gospel, right?
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.000]   This is the ramification that if you were dead, then you were absolutely detestable
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.320]   relationally and separate from God.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.700]   If you've been made alive in Christ, now you are bringing, have been brought to him in
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.200]   Christ because our Lord has ascended to the Father, right?
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.320]   Because our Lord is with God.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.480]   Likewise, you will be with God.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.100]   The ramification of the gospel, it has its great impact and it has everything to do with
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.660]   you and God, right?
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.460]   It's all about you and God.
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:30.180]   It's not about, "Oh, my former self was poor, sad, hardened, and now I'm much better than
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.180]   that."
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.340]   It has everything to do with you and God.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.700]   And so, we have our passage today.
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.060]   Let's take a moment to read it.
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.520]   Please look at your passage and it says, "Therefore, remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.440]   the flesh who are called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision, which is performed
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.120]   in the flesh by human hands.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.240]   Remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:04.480]   of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.760]   in the world.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.480]   But now in Christ Jesus, you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.200]   blood of Christ.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.360]   For he himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.760]   of the dividing wall by abolishing in his flesh the enmity, which is the law of commandments
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.000]   contained in ordinances, so that in himself he might make the two into one new man, thus
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.040]   establishing peace and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.720]   By it having put to death the enmity.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.320]   And he came and preached peace to you who are far away and peace to those who are near.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.320]   For through him we both have our access in one spirit to the Father."
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.320]   Amen.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.320]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.440]   God, we thank you for your grace and Lord, we thank you so much.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.840]   God, not only did you free us from the oppressive grips of Satan of this world and our flesh,
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.480]   Father God, you showed us how dead we were spiritually.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.000]   And Father, you have made us alive in Christ.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.880]   But we thank you, Father God, because in justifying us, in freeing us, we just recognize, God,
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.360]   that you did not leave us like that.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:28.400]   But Father God, in your love, in your inexplicable care, in your mercy, you purposely drew us
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.760]   near to yourself.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.720]   And for that, Lord, today we want to reflect, we want to meditate, and ultimately we want
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.560]   to praise you and thank you.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.920]   We thank you, it's in Christ, and we pray.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.920]   Amen.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.920]   Okay.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.320]   So as we take a look at this passage, there is clearly a section where it describes your
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.160]   former alienated state.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.260]   Yes?
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.160]   And remember, as you do your Bible study, if you see the repetition of terms, make sure
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.280]   you actually list them off and stare at it and observe all that you can learn.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.800]   But before we even get there, he tells you and commands you, "Remember all this stuff."
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.840]   Right?
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.720]   So we can't just slide by that, and we have to ask ourselves the question, why does Apostle
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:25.120]   Paul command the church to remember and reflect upon all of these various terms that are oh
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.560]   so discouraging?
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.400]   And it's inclusive of the previous ones.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.040]   The previous ones where it said, "And you were dead in your trespasses and sins."
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.840]   Those things we should actually remember too.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.560]   Wow, he says, "Therefore remember."
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.880]   So in thought of your deadness and the mercies of God that made you alive, you should also
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.800]   therefore remember this as your previous former state of alienation prior to you receiving
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.480]   Christ.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.080]   And just as a good way to do Bible study, when you ask questions for yourself, any time
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.560]   you see a command in the New Testament, especially these didactic teaching epistles, these like,
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.800]   you know, the lessons and the directions that we receive, ask yourself these questions like,
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.840]   what does Apostle Paul want me to do when he says, "Remember?"
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.060]   Right?
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.800]   Because is he telling you to go into your room all pitifully in the dark and just sulk?
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.160]   Is he telling you to be like, "Oh yeah, that's right."
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.480]   Like is that all he expected us to do?
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.280]   And then you got to ask yourself, am I doing this right now?
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.520]   How am I doing this right now?
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.520]   How am I not doing this right now?
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.760]   Because this is a command for you to heed.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.300]   This is something that's actually repeated multiple times in the Bible and the scriptures
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.240]   rebukes us when we forget.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.280]   Sometimes we're like, "Man, we received such a grace.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.600]   I'll never forget this."
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.800]   And then like we, the MO, the like, the operating, you know, the tendency of mankind throughout
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.200]   history has been, we just always tend to forget even the greatest of things.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.640]   I mean, the Exodus.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.640]   God with his strong, mighty hand delivers the people.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.800]   They walk the desert and like, "Are you even with us?"
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.880]   You know, like, it's crazy how quickly they forget.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.440]   So, are you remembering?
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.680]   Do you understand what he means when he tells you to remember?
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.360]   But moving forward, I asked you as a study of this passage, please make sure you understand
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.720]   the description of the conditions that we were in.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.720]   Because why?
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.080]   We're all Gentiles, right?
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.080]   This is us, okay?
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.520]   This is all about us.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.960]   And he says, "Remember all these different depictions."
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.820]   So, I have for us, I like to highlight in red the stuff that's sinful or the former
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.860]   conditions when we were lost.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.860]   And there's so many.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.640]   Yeah, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.120]   And what's more, I highlight the ones in the next section because as he was describing
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.200]   what Christ has done, he gave different descriptions of the state that we were in.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:57.480]   So, as a summary list for us, it talks about being separated from Christ, right?
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.240]   Excluded from the commonwealth of Israel.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.240]   There's more.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.400]   You know, all of that stuff is strangers, right?
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.200]   You guys have heard recently probably the term being thrown around a lot, xenophobia,
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   right?
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   That's the term here.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.240]   Because xeno means foreigner.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.000]   You are a stranger, okay?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.060]   You're not the local guy that everybody knows, right?
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.360]   Nobody knows you.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:26.160]   Having no hope without a God in this world, you are absolutely far off with a barrier
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.960]   of a dividing wall.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:35.680]   And there was enmity between you and God's law, between you, God himself, between you
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.720]   and all the people around you.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.240]   Think about this for a moment and take a moment to observe that.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.820]   This was my best shot at a picture.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.120]   If you can't tell, the guy has no neck because he's sad, right?
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.820]   His head's down, okay?
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.840]   And that's the way it should be.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.840]   There's like, you can't really see it very well, but there's like snake and bone down
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:05.400]   there because there is a level of this depiction where you are not in a neutral state with
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.400]   God, okay?
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:14.800]   Whenever you meet the Lord, you are not in a mind my own business world.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   Some people think that.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.840]   It's like, "You know, I'm just minding my own business and God's out there and he wants
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.240]   me to have a better purpose for my life than the one I purpose for myself now."
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.280]   Sometimes, don't settle for the less purpose, go for the higher.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.280]   No, no, no.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.700]   That is not the picture the gospel paints, is it?
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.320]   This is the picture the gospel paints.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.560]   Not only are you far from God.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.920]   There is this massive wall between you two.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.580]   And there is this like wickedness.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.260]   There is this deadness.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.100]   There is all kinds of vileness around us.
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:53.240]   And so, as a takeaway, I've got two questions, right?
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:11:02.760]   One is, how humiliating do you think this is for the Gentiles in this church?
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.760]   And that question then goes to you.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.880]   Have you felt the humiliation of the gospel?
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:16.600]   If you've heard a gospel that didn't make you feel rejected, perhaps you didn't listen
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600]   to the right one.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.720]   Let me repeat that, okay?
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:26.880]   If you have never felt, after hearing the gospel, a sense of rejection, I'm not sure
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.160]   if you heard the whole thing.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.400]   Why?
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.560]   Because if you were looking at this laundry list, or I guess if you were looking at this
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.400]   depiction of the picture that Apostle Paul is trying to give you, I want you to understand
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.600]   the picture.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.880]   I want you to see the reality of where you were, right?
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:50.440]   He is showing you an incredibly bleak, bleak picture of your life.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:57.040]   I mean, to say that you're separate and excluded, you are alienated and strange, but he flat
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.200]   out tells you, you had no hope.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.520]   Have you ever said that to anybody in your life?
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.520]   You're so hopeless.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.320]   That's a mean thing to say.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:18.680]   But if you think about it from a relational picture, this is a picture of complete rejection.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.240]   This is a kind of picture where maybe I should have drawn the guy banging on the wall and
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:29.680]   God saying, "No, I will not accept you and this wall exists between you and me.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.560]   Your sins have separated us."
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.560]   Right?
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.760]   That's the picture.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.000]   That is a profoundly humbling thing to accept.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.920]   And so the second question I have for you is, do you have an understanding of how desperate
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.640]   your life is prior to Christ?
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.460]   When you look back, the command is for you to remember, right?
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:59.500]   So when you look back at your life prior to Christ, do you summarize and interpret it
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.500]   that way?
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.020]   What am I talking about here?
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:10.420]   If we're truly thinking about a state of despair, if we're truly thinking about a state of rejection,
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.420]   it should really, really hit us.
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.940]   But sometimes when I read people's testimonies, their depiction of their previous life is
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:17.940]   like, "You know what?
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.660]   Back then, I just had it hard.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.540]   I had the hard knock life.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.420]   I wasn't loved by my parents.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.940]   No one really cared.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.180]   But now it's amazing."
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:33.740]   Okay, that may all be true.
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.600]   That may all be true.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.500]   But is that the picture that the scripture and the gospel paints for us?
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:49.220]   What's more, you think about why Apostle Paul would need to say this to the Gentiles, right?
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.380]   You hearken back to, let's say, the beginning chapters of 1 Corinthians.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:59.980]   It is so innate within us to have arrogance and pride, right?
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:06.100]   Where you join the privilege, where you join this group, this group that like, "Oh my goodness,
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.680]   we have the promises of God, right?
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   We have hope.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.900]   We have future with the Lord," and all this kind of stuff.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.620]   And that should be to us like praise and thankfulness.
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.580]   And then it immediately turns into like, "And you, right?
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.660]   What's wrong with you?"
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:28.100]   It's pretty incredible, but we can already imagine the scene in that section.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:35.860]   Now in order for us to just appreciate this all the more because, again, for us as we
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.820]   look at this passage, I introduced it by saying, "What an incredible contrast."
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.480]   Just like the previous passage, it's an incredible contrast.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.620]   For us to appreciate the contrast, we have to then get the first part right.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.780]   And therefore, in order to do that, an example.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:59.420]   An example of how destitute, an example of how separated, an example of how estranged
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.140]   we are from God.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.540]   There is this word that I have a hard time pronouncing.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.020]   I always have to slow down.
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.700]   Enmity.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.700]   Anyway, this word means enemy.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.380]   It means hostility.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.140]   It means hatred.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.320]   And what's really interesting about this is, here's the question I want to ask you.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:29.500]   When you think about your life before Christ, it is not something that is inherently observed,
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:35.700]   and it's not something that feels natural, but the Bible teaches us before you are saved
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:42.900]   in Christ, your relationship with God is absolute hatred.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.740]   There is an animosity between you and God.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.620]   Is that something that really kind of strikes us?
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.940]   And you know what's very interesting is, Scripture talks about this.
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.340]   Let me give you first a picture.
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:00.460]   This is absolutely foolish, but this is the way that I imagine it, right?
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:06.140]   We're puny, tiny little people, and somehow we think we can put our dukes up and go at
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.900]   it against God, right?
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.980]   But Scripture says this, "And through him to reconcile all things to himself, having
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.780]   made peace through the blood of his cross.
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.700]   Through him I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven, and although you are
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.220]   formerly," what?
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:25.580]   "Alienated, hostile in mind, and engaged in evil deeds."
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:30.580]   That is your description, and that word for hostile is the same word you find there.
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:35.380]   What's more, in Colossians 2, verse 10 through 14, some of you guys have already texted me.
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:40.740]   It's kind of weird that the passage talks about the law being hostile, but take a look
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.740]   at this.
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.460]   "Having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with him
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.460]   through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.640]   When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.300]   you alive together with him, having forgiven us of all our transgressions."
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.300]   And then look at this.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:06.620]   "Having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:13.460]   hostile to us, and he has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross."
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:20.980]   The way I want to describe that to you is, a lot of people mistakenly think that, again,
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:26.500]   we are neutral with God, minding our own business, and what we have to do is accept this God
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.820]   who's going to make our lives so much better.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.100]   Now, is God going to radically transform our lives?
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.420]   Yes.
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.540]   But the scripture says the hostility actually went both ways.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:44.620]   You are hostile to God because prior to us knowing God, every single man stood as Lord
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:50.700]   over his own life, which means your kingship stands directly hostile to God's kingship.
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:56.100]   But what's more, your transgression and sins are like a rap sheet.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.680]   You have a criminal record that judges you.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.240]   You have a certificate of debt that says you owe.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.240]   You have ledger.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.780]   You have certified documents that show you how wrong you were.
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.460]   And in that way, the law of God is hostile to you because God's good and holy word compared
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.900]   to you, it stands in judgment over you.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.820]   It absolutely stands in judgment over you.
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.980]   Okay.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.700]   So then, I take a moment to think about this.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:35.920]   Like, I want to just give you a final illustration, then turn to the but and then turn it over,
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.920]   okay?
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.600]   I hope I did enough to get us to think about that question.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.960]   Do we really understand how lost we were before Christ?
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.400]   You guys know I'm super into cars.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.240]   You know what car nobody wants?
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:58.200]   It's not the swagger wagon because it's a mama van, right?
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.020]   People love that stuff.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.940]   It's not the little dinky cars because they're small.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.620]   No, people really love that stuff.
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.440]   It's not the style of cars that make people not want it.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.440]   You know what people really hate?
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.820]   They hate salvage title cars.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:18.220]   Cars that have hidden faults, that have been in wrecks before, that have been deemed at
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.220]   loss.
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.780]   Nobody would even pay full price for that.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.860]   Yes?
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:28.680]   If there is a description for me that worked, was to think about a damaged vehicle that
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.240]   has no value.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.240]   Why?
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.080]   Because it's unwanted.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.040]   The highlight of this passage is not so much just your deadness.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.760]   The highlight of this passage is your rejection relationally.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.940]   The gospel teaches us it's not because God is mean.
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.140]   It's not because he's so biased.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.900]   Our deadness separates us from God.
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:58.340]   Our stain of sin is a sickness that nobody would want to be around.
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:04.440]   I mean, we're in the midst of a panic because there is an unknown, very little that we know
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.600]   about this disease that's going around rampant.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:14.020]   If an individual is then diagnosed with that disease, that person is cast out.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.800]   And so it was all through history with the Jewish people and their regiments and the
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.960]   Levitical law so that it would be shown.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.600]   Sin is not to stain this community.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.540]   You are in absolute isolation.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.820]   This is the state before us and God.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:40.220]   And then he says, reminding us of the future passage, I mean, sorry, previous passage,
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:48.140]   but God being rich in mercy because of his great love, which he has loved us, even when
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:52.620]   we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ by grace, you have
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:59.180]   been saved and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:06.780]   And then today, but now in Christ Jesus, you who were formerly so far off, you have been
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.780]   brought near by the blood of Christ.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.060]   Let's all together say amen.
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.060]   Ready?
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.060]   One, two, three.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.060]   Amen.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:20.100]   This is to us the greatest treasure.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:25.500]   Because if you actually understood how far you were, if you actually understood how much
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:32.460]   our sins separate us from this loving God, when we hear the news, Christ draws you near.
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.660]   This is the turnaround.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.100]   This is the great contrast.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:39.140]   This is the major point of this segment.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.500]   It is the topic sentence.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.900]   Memorize it.
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:44.900]   Think about it.
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.900]   Dwell upon it.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.100]   Meditate upon it.
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.840]   And the only way I want to have us, not the only way, but one of the important ways I
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:55.700]   want you guys to think about this is because, remember, one of the passages talked about
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.900]   you are being called the uncircumcised by the circumcised.
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.060]   Yes?
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.380]   Who are the circumcised?
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.660]   The Jewish people.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:05.660]   Good.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.100]   That one person who answered, thank you.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.780]   It's the Jewish people.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.420]   Because that was their whole tradition and mark.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:18.260]   I am a chosen person of God in the chosen nation of God as a sign of the covenant of
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.260]   Abraham.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.260]   We are all circumcised.
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.580]   And to be uncircumcised, wow.
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.900]   What offense against the holy God.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.400]   And then therefore that also elicited a pride in them.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:39.040]   You uncircumcised going, you ethnic, all the others who don't have this promise mark, all
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.760]   of you, like dogs.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.760]   It's crazy.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.840]   If you read old, old literature, the Jewish people hated everybody else.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.400]   And what's really interesting is everybody else hated them.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.180]   There was just a hate, hate relationship that existed.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:59.040]   So much so the Jewish people would say the ethnic, the gentiles, were literally food
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.320]   for the fires of hell, fuel for the fires of hell.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:08.960]   It was against their law, their systematic laws to even help a gentile woman give birth.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.040]   Why?
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.760]   Because that just means another heathen would enter this land.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.920]   And then throughout history, so many people have hated the Jewish people.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.720]   And then around the time of this writing, the people saw the Jewish individuals as the
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.440]   dirtiest of the dirtiest.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.240]   That is heightened by the story of Sarah and Hagar.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.120]   You guys remember them?
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.480]   Abraham was given this promise, you will have a son.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.040]   Many, many, many years went by.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.520]   Sarah got super impatient and was like, what in the world is happening?
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.720]   She looked to her slave girl, Hagar, and said, I want you to sleep with your master and have
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.000]   a baby.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.880]   Upon having a baby, Sarah got super jealous.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.340]   The green monster came out and said, I need you to get out.
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.160]   So Abraham cast out Hagar.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.920]   Now you guys recall the story.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:24:00.680]   Hagar goes walking in the wilderness and she cannot feed her son.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:06.520]   And so in order to not see her son whimper and die of starvation, she puts her son by
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.880]   a bush and she goes walking away to be a distance away.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.920]   But I want you to think about the perspective of the son.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.120]   Because sometimes we think it was an infant baby.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.560]   I think the story actually talks about some years going by.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.360]   And so that child posed a threat.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.800]   Yes?
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.720]   I think the child was old enough to understand what was going on.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.440]   But think from his perspective.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:46.360]   Like to have the emotional contrast of not only being the slave boy, but the unwanted
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.560]   boy who poses a threat to actually your father.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.560]   Yeah?
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.600]   And then to be in a state where there is nothing for you.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.840]   There is no commonwealth for you.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.440]   There's nothing but desert.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:08.820]   And now what you're looking at is absolute bleak, bleak moment of despair with no food.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:14.360]   And the only thing you're thinking is I'm going to die in this place.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.320]   That is the contrast.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:23.480]   When there is this contrast between you uncircumcised to now you being brought near.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.480]   That's the reality.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.120]   That's the line.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.680]   That's the heritage.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.680]   That's the genealogy.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.720]   Does that make sense?
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:37.240]   And so for us to appreciate this contrast and now, and now those who are outside the
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:43.680]   camp, those who are detested, those who are absolutely rejected, we are being brought
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.200]   near by the blood of Christ.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.440]   Praise God, praise God.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:54.360]   And scripture says here, Psalm 73 verse 28, "As for me, the nearness of God is my good.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:26:01.440]   I have made the Lord God my refuge that I may tell of all his works."
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.000]   Can I give you guys kind of like a, I just want to meditate on this and give you like
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.360]   a personal story.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:12.520]   Because today's passage and the passages in Ephesians chapter 1 through 3 you guys know
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.440]   are conceptual.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.680]   It's the theology we're supposed to appreciate and understand.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:24.480]   And I'm going to give a really personal example, okay, between me and my wife with Bia.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:31.160]   Because here in this passage in Psalm 73 he says, "The nearness of my God is good."
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.520]   And the thing that I'm trying to get at with trying to exposit this passage is have you
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:44.400]   felt that because you understood yourself to be Ishmael, the Gentile, the wrong lineage,
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.280]   the rejected child, right?
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:52.880]   To go from that to them being brought near by the blood of Christ, seen, seen as a child
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.080]   of God, okay?
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.680]   There is an experiential exhortation I want to give to you is when we hear the gospel
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:08.160]   we then have to feel the pains of the farness and also the incredible bliss and joy of the
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.480]   nearness, right?
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:16.520]   And I'm going to challenge you, even as a Christian, if you're walking your life and
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.960]   the things that's going to motivate you for sanctification, the things that's going to
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:25.400]   motivate you and fuel you for trying to live in the nearness of God, let it be this aspect
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.400]   of the gospel.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:34.160]   And so now to my example, my wife and I, Bia and I, feel like we have a really great relationship.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:38.800]   But I know you guys, it's going to surprise you, sometimes we fight.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:44.320]   All right, so some of you guys are like, "Why is that funny?"
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.440]   Sometimes we fight and sometimes we fight hard.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:54.760]   And I'm going to be honest, even though sometimes in my pride I'm like, "I'm the humblest guy
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.520]   in the world.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.280]   I'm so reasonable and logical and I know how to fix problems.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.280]   I'm a counselor.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.400]   Come on, I can do this."
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:11.840]   But man, sometimes you're just really humble by your own weakness and sometimes I just
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.600]   act like a child and then ruin the good things that we have.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.720]   Case in point, one moment, okay?
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.720]   My wife and I got into an argument and because I got super defensive, I did the, "What do
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.720]   you mean by this?
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   What do you mean by that?"
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.280]   When you get super defensive, you just like, "Define this, define this.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.280]   What are you saying?"
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.200]   And then you kind of exaggerate the stuff that they say.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.360]   "Do you mean that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah?"
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.360]   And it's like, "Did I say that?"
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.560]   I'm like, "Are you giving me attitude there?"
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.080]   I get all upset, right?
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.040]   And then so just start making things worse.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:51.360]   Now in conflict, what you're supposed to do is in conflict you're supposed to actually
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.320]   pull the other person closer and say, "Let me understand what you're saying and hear
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.320]   you.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.840]   Do you understand me so you should be willing to speak?"
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.320]   But then when you act like a child, you push the other person away.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:10.360]   You're like, "If you really want to understand me, then you come after me.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.320]   If you want us to reconcile, then you reconcile with me."
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.520]   And you turn to Cole's shoulder and go, "Hmm," right?
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.520]   And then you walk away, okay?
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.200]   Bia early on in marriage, she hated it when I'm like, "You know what?
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.320]   I can't deal with this right now.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   I can't talk."
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.160]   So then I'd be like, "I need to go for a walk, right, to cool down."
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.160]   But she hated that.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.160]   She would be like, "Do you have any idea what it looks like when you turn your back
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.160]   on me?"
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.200]   And I'm like, "Oh, man, it's true."
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.040]   And then you realize sometimes you do the cold shoulder and back turn because you know
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.680]   it hurts the other person.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:49.440]   Okay, long story short, there was a moment in our marriage relationship where I did that,
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.040]   where I did that for like three weeks.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.680]   And the house was cold as ice.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.280]   I would come home and we would do like little talk, like, "Did you eat?
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.280]   I'm here.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.280]   I'm here.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.280]   I'm here."
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.280]   And then that's it.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.280]   There was nothing else.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.920]   You know what was really crazy?
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.640]   After I did that for like two, three weeks, I could almost feel my heart getting crusty.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.000]   Do you know what I'm talking about?
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.800]   And then therefore, when I went to work, I sat down and tried to read this book.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.500]   I couldn't read it.
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.240]   So I closed it and started distracting myself with other stuff.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.680]   What I like to do is I like to clean.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.920]   So I started cleaning the church.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.640]   And then I started trying to write because obviously I have to write sermons.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.080]   So I started trying to write a sermon.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.560]   I couldn't write.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.240]   And I just sat there staring at my screen.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.240]   It was weird.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.080]   I felt my heart getting crusty and then I felt the rest of my body getting crusty.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.920]   It was like ruining me.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.240]   And then Pastor Peter walked by the office and I was like, "I can't do this anymore."
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:56.280]   I just started crying.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.640]   And I was just like, you know, like the world was done.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.840]   And I was like, "I can't do this anymore."
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.800]   And Pastor Peter had to guide me and stuff like that.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:14.200]   I remember it was weird because the pain of being far from the one who I'm supposed to
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:21.200]   be one with, the pain of being far from somebody I'm supposed to be so intimate and close with,
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.600]   it was just too painful.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:31.080]   And so after that, it's literally every other like argument that I had, I was like, "No,
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.200]   I don't want to feel far from you.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.560]   I don't want to feel like distant.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.840]   I don't want to feel like there's a gap.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.040]   I don't want to feel any of that.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.200]   So if we're going to talk and stuff, we're just going to talk here."
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.440]   It just kind of ruined me.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:49.720]   But that is how it's supposed to be with you and God.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:55.120]   For you to feel far from God should be absolutely painful.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:00.920]   And that's why to us, when we think about, and when I think about this passage, we should
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.820]   have the emotional experience.
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:09.560]   We should have the affections where we can say with our hearts, "The nearness of my God
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.560]   is my good."
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.720]   And I know you guys have felt it.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.800]   And so the opposite of that, when we sin, when we falter, when we waver, that to us
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.520]   is the most costly thing.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.040]   Amen?
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:29.760]   And so again, this passage for us shows us and highlights the gospel truth that to us,
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:35.700]   the greatest impact of the gospel is you have access to God.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.760]   You have now a nearness and you've been brought close.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.320]   You have now such a oneness with him.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.220]   This is to you, your great treasure, and this is to you, your great privilege.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.460]   And I use this to share the gospel.
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.400]   When somebody comes to me and they're not Christian and they tell me about how their
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:54.800]   life is a wreck, they tell me how they can't handle the stress, they tell me how they can't
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.120]   handle the pains of their family dynamics, and they can't handle why they are made certain
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.120]   ways.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:04.160]   I tell them, when your relationship with the one who should be everything to you is off,
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.460]   guess what?
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.800]   Everything is off.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.920]   Your heart is crusty, your body is crusty, and you can't do anything else.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.400]   Let's make this right with God.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.840]   You have to reconcile with him.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.200]   You have to come to a repentance.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:25.040]   And when you become one with him and you feel the nearness of God, trust me, all the other
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.680]   things will come into place.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.680]   Amen?
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:35.280]   Now, in the last section, we have the fruit of all of that coming near to God.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:40.920]   And coming near to God, we have peace and oneness of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.960]   We have peace and oneness with our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:48.480]   Now, this next section is long, and I'm not going to be able to cover all of it, but we
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.920]   just want to highlight a few things.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:55.200]   There is so much going on here, but I want to highlight a couple things for you.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.360]   A, the term peace is a major point of this section, clearly, right?
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.640]   He himself is our peace.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.400]   That is a massive statement, right?
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.500]   That is like, you've got to dwell on that.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.120]   One of our guys, like, that's kind of like saying, like, God is holy.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.920]   That's kind of like saying God is love, right?
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.920]   That's true.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.640]   To say Christ is, he himself is your peace is a huge statement.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.920]   And what's more, the passage is very clear.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.820]   He is establishing peace for you.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.600]   He is preaching peace to you.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.380]   He is giving peace to you, right?
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.940]   So now we have to ask the question, like, what is this peace?
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.680]   What is all of this, right?
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.480]   And what I want to highlight to you guys is just one of these dictionary entries.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.080]   The peace, this is where we get the name.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.800]   It's a beautiful name, Irene.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   Okay?
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.800]   That's the term for peace.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.880]   But look at this.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.840]   Peace used in the scriptures has so many different entries.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.400]   Peace, yes, means harmony.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.960]   Peace means tranquility.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.860]   Peace means reconciliation God.
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.480]   Peace means divine favor.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.920]   Peace means state of tranquility again.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.440]   Peace means having health.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.800]   Peace means having prosperity and welfare.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.280]   Peace means everything good, right?
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.200]   It's just like this massive statement.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.840]   I read that, I started laughing, right?
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.800]   It's like, I'm trying to define something here, man.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.080]   And if you write every kind of good, that's just way too broad.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.960]   Peace means happiness.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.200]   And so I want you to think about that.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:25.880]   God is giving you His peace.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.840]   God is giving you the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:34.000]   And I want to make this kind of profound for you by giving you this example.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.960]   Peace is not just like, um, right?
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.320]   That's not peace, okay?
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.480]   Peace is powerful.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.480]   It's not just simply a state of mind, but it includes a state of mind.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.680]   Peace is absolutely powerful.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:50.400]   And the example that I want to give to you is I want you to think superpower, okay?
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.000]   The US as a nation is a superpower in this world.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.200]   The whole world looks to the United States to what?
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.800]   Keep the peace.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:06.800]   When you have some crazy terrorist regime trying to overthrow this small little nation,
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   who jumps in typically?
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   The US.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.520]   Now I want you to think about this.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:17.380]   In order to make peace in the region, what do they have to do?
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:21.380]   They have to exercise the full force of their military.
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.900]   They have to exercise their authority.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.020]   They have to exercise a kind intention.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.020]   Now go back to this passage.
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.060]   Take a look at this.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.480]   And Christ broke down the barriers.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.880]   He abolished the flesh, in His flesh, the enmity.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.880]   Mary says that He put to death the enmity.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:46.200]   Think about the incredible power of God and the authority of God to not just, "Hey guys,
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.200]   relax."
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.200]   That is not what Jesus said.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:56.520]   He is coming into our lives, abolishing, destroying, and putting to death those things of wickedness,
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.760]   those things of animosity, those things that make for conflict.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.720]   This is to us an incredible, incredible blessing of God.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:10.800]   Because, then, the power of God, the incredible blessing of God, then equates to our tranquility.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.520]   It equates to our prosperity.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:20.080]   It equates to everything in the condition where we can have actual happiness.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:26.240]   Christ then, He Himself, is the context by which we can actually live.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.240]   Live with hope.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.100]   I mean, think about the corollary that I'm talking about.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:35.380]   If you are an individual in a conflict-stricken nation, and a superpower comes in, and it
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:42.660]   eradicates the terrorists, and gives you a brand new hope, that is, to us, our victory.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.980]   And then, what's more contained in this passage is oneness.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.860]   Oneness.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.980]   Making all of you one with Himself.
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.260]   Those are the two things I want to highlight from this passage.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:05.620]   Peter said in verse 7 that God wanted to show His incredible riches and grace and kindness
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.940]   towards us in Christ.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.420]   God wanted to show us His love.
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:14.060]   And what's really incredible, he says, I highlighted it for you, he says, "I am making both groups
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.060]   into one.
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.860]   I am making one new man.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.720]   I am making one body.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.500]   I am making you all one in spirit."
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.620]   I would like to highlight this interesting passage for you.
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.900]   I go to this passage regularly for marriage sermons.
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.940]   When I officiate weddings and stuff, I go to this passage.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:35.300]   And it's not Ephesians 5 where it says, "Husband, love your wives as Christ loved the church."
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:41.420]   It's actually Jesus' high priestly prayer in John chapter 17.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:50.260]   In Jesus' high priestly prayer in John chapter 17, Jesus says in His prayer to God, "I do
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:55.100]   not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through your
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:39:05.340]   word, that they may all be one, even as you, Father, are in Me and I in you, that they
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:10.300]   also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you sent Me.
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.020]   The glory which you have given Me, I have given to them."
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:21.180]   Right, like the glory that God the Father has given to Christ the Son for Christ's
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:25.060]   incredible work of salvation and sacrifice.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.940]   He says, "I have given to them that they may be," what?
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:34.340]   "One, just as we are one, I in them and you in Me, that they may be perfected in unity,
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:40.860]   so that the world may know that you sent Me and love them even as you have loved Me."
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.980]   This to me summarizes what Apostle Paul is saying.
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:51.140]   God wants to show His magnificent love, magnificent love.
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:57.500]   But the way that He's going to do that is not just by dropping gifts from a helicopter.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:03.660]   He's going to come down and be near you, but beyond that, He says, "I want to be one with
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.660]   you."
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:11.300]   I mean, we appreciate Christ's sacrifice because He died in our place.
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:17.420]   But think about, I can't even describe it in words, but think about the arena of sacrifice
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:25.980]   when you share yourself in such a way that you want to have that person be one with you.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.980]   That to me is just elevating everything.
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:37.020]   But there is no sparing of yourself, but as you are, you want that person to be.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:41.860]   And for God, that is to us the most incredible gift of all.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:46.980]   God desires oneness because He in His nature is one.
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:53.540]   And what He's desiring for us in His blessing is that He would make all of us one with Himself.
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:58.780]   You know, this whole passage section began in Ephesians chapter 1 with, "Blessed be the
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.780]   Father."
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:00.780]   Right?
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.380]   Are you meditating on the blessings of God?
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.380]   It's incredible.
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:10.140]   Like, the limits just keep going higher and higher, I feel like, right?
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.780]   The whole idea of raising you and seating you and all that stuff was just mind-blowing.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:22.260]   And then to hear this, that He is in unrestraint giving to us all that He is.
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.260]   Let's pray.
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:35.500]   Heavenly Father, we thank You so much for Your grace and we want to thank You so much.
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:42.500]   I pray, Father God, that as we are looking at this passage, Lord, may all the things
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:47.740]   that we're learning truly convict, break our hearts.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:51.360]   And Lord, the things that we are learning, we want to remember it, Lord.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.780]   We want it to affect us so much that we never forget.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:59.020]   And I pray, Father God, in that way, we're walking by faith.
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:05.220]   We're walking, Father God, with the lens of the gospel of how amazing You are to us and
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.980]   the love that You have shown us in Christ.
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:12.660]   We again want to just thank You, thank You, thank You from the bottom of our hearts.
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.660]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:13.660]   Amen.
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:14.540]   Amen.
