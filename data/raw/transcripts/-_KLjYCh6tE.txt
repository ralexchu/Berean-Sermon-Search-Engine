[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320]   Well, how do we find freedom from our worries?
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.480]   One of my favorite answers to this question is from the Apostle Paul in Romans 8, verses
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.480]   13-15.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.520]   There, he writes this, "For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.160]   if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.960]   For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.920]   For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.320]   the spirit of adoption as sons by whom we cry, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.080]   We battle sin to be freed from worry, and in that battle we demonstrate our faith in
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.200]   Jesus Christ and in His work for us.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.520]   Here's Pastor John preaching on this text back in 2002 to explain.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.360]   Ask yourself this question, "Why didn't the Bible just teach me to defeat sin by asking
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.860]   the Holy Spirit to do it?"
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.820]   Why isn't prayer the be-all and end-all of this battle?
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.480]   So here comes a temptation to either feel discouraged about finances or to feel fearful
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.940]   because you're sick or to feel proud because you did something right.
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.400]   Why at that moment isn't the way of killing that simply say, "Holy Spirit, I ask you to
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400]   come now and defeat the sin of my life.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.400]   Amen."
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.960]   And it's done.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.800]   Ask and you will receive, right?
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.800]   Wrong.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.800]   Why?
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.000]   Jesus gets no glory if you do it that way.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.500]   The reason it says in Galatians 3:5 that the Holy Spirit is supplied and becomes miracle-working
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:54.240]   in power by hearing with faith is because if you left out the hearing dimension, namely
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.420]   hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ and the promises that He bought for you by His blood,
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.960]   if Jesus doesn't get the credit for those promises that you're laying hold of, then
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.600]   He won't get any glory.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.040]   He's just out of the equation.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.680]   And you might now and then think, "Well, theologically, I guess He's the foundation of everything."
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.960]   Well, you know what?
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.820]   Foundations in your house get no attention.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.040]   You don't go through the day saying, "I'm so thankful that I have a 12-course basement.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.640]   I love those cement blocks.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.640]   They're so pretty."
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.360]   You don't even think about the foundation in your house.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.360]   So to say every now and then, "Jesus is the foundation of everything."
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.980]   So what?
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.820]   He gets no glory if you never talk about it, you never sing about it, you never bank on
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.080]   His blood to buy for you the promises.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.640]   Do you remember what 2 Corinthians 1:20 says?
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.760]   All the promises of God are yes in Jesus.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.200]   What that means is when you live your Christian life by picking a promise, banking on it,
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.100]   plugging in, faith goes into the Word of God, you know who bought this for you?
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.100]   Jesus.
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.240]   We're sinners.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.240]   I'm a sinner.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.080]   I don't deserve any promise of God fulfilled in my life.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.440]   How can I count on the promises of God being fulfilled in my life?
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.440]   One thing, Christ died for me.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.240]   Christ bought every promise for John Piper.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.080]   This is the new covenant.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.920]   Christ shed His blood so that I can pick anywhere in the Bible and say, "I'll take that promise
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.920]   for today.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   I'll help you.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.920]   I'll strengthen you.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.280]   I'll hold you up with my victorious right hand.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.880]   I'll fight for you.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.880]   I'll supply your needs."
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.240]   I can pick that promise.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.240]   Why?
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   Because I'm deserving?
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.320]   No way.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.740]   Because Jesus is deserving and I trust Jesus and He gives it to me.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.040]   So that's the second thing to observe.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.320]   Let me close now with a couple of illustrations.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.680]   We got three missionary families that have gone out from this church who are walking
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.000]   through the darkest waters of eviction from Tanzania, this very moment that we've ever
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.520]   had.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.480]   And put yourself in their shoes right now.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.280]   They've been given a 30-day notice out of here with all your families and all your belongings.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.400]   It's the only home their children have ever known.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.520]   Denise wrote us last Easter and she wrote it.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.240]   We got it on Easter and she wrote the email the night before Easter.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.120]   And this is what she said.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.720]   She's picturing the disciples between Good Friday and Easter.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.680]   They are sitting quietly and numbly at someone's house and they don't know about the resurrection
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.880]   that is to come.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.320]   That's what this time feels like to us in many ways.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.000]   Darkness, an unknown future.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.300]   Out of the blue we're packing up and leaving the country, our home for the last seven years.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.560]   The only home our children have known.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.440]   Now ask yourself, what are the sins threatening here?
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.360]   Here are the ones I thought of.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:16.320]   Anger, despair, self-pity, fear, impatience, irritability.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.720]   Those are a few sins that would threaten to rise up in the Billhorns and the Andersons
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.120]   and the Rasmussens right now.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:31.400]   Now listen to this warrior Denise and her email as an embodiment of this sermon.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.320]   We are clinging to these truths.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   Do you hear it?
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.080]   Do you hear it?
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.800]   We are clinging to truth.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.000]   No vague notion of a God out there somewhere who's nice.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.100]   We are clinging to particular truths.
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.240]   We are clinging to these truths.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.760]   God is good.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.520]   He is in control.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.240]   He loves us more than we can comprehend.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.560]   He has plans to give us a hope and a future, plans to prosper us.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.080]   Sound familiar?
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.840]   Our spirits are understandably low.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.360]   We are emotionally and physically exhausted, but, all caps, because the Lord's great love
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.840]   we are not consumed.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.440]   His compassions never fail.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.560]   They are new every morning.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.160]   And thus she puts to death the deeds of the body.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.880]   One more illustration.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.320]   Rich and Tricia Dilworth were here for several years until they left last year to go to Africa
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.160]   with three small children.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.600]   They worked with refugees in the community, learning language and so on.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.560]   They're going to a country that is so fragile, so hostile that they can't name it.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:55.120]   And imagine three small children, young couple, going to a destitute land with no infrastructure,
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.000]   a religion that is hostile to Christianity.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.800]   What kinds of things would arise in your mind as you make such an obedient plan?
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.280]   A quote from his letter.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.700]   This is the February newsletter that I got.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.920]   It's one of the most powerful applications of this message in a missionary letter.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.760]   And I've read many and all our missionaries get this, I think, and they weave it into
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.760]   their letters.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.240]   But this one was remarkable.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:30.840]   Whereas the constitution of this country may state one thing, the word of God says, "The
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.080]   one who is in you is greater than the one who's in the world."
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.800]   Where fear says, "What if blank happens?"
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.180]   Faith says, "Do not fear, for I am with you.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.180]   Do not be dismayed.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.180]   I am your God.
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.180]   I will strengthen you.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.180]   I will help you.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.420]   I will uphold you with my victorious right hand."
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.340]   When worry surfaces, faith responds, "Peace, I leave with you.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.780]   My peace, I give to you.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.140]   I do not give to you as the world gives.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.700]   Do not let your hearts be troubled.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.540]   Do not be afraid."
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:07.100]   And doubt and frustration scoff, saying, "They'll never change.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.220]   This is a waste of time."
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:20.700]   Jesus looks us in the eye and responds, "With man, this is impossible, but not with God.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.640]   All things are possible with God."
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.820]   We need to become the kind of people who, when we're walking across a bridge or walking
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:34.140]   between offices or walking into a classroom, young people are nervous about some test or
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.380]   something where you're walking down the hall and you wonder, "Yikes, did I wear the wrong
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.380]   color today?"
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.500]   Or whatever, "Am I going to be viewed funny?"
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.940]   If you believe, He's right here.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.100]   I will never leave you and I will never forsake you.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.660]   And He says, "All things are possible with me.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.820]   Trust me.
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.940]   I love you.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.380]   I will take care of you.
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.620]   I'll supply all your needs.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.620]   I like you.
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.220]   I died for you.
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.180]   I have counted you righteous."
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.420]   I mean, would not you become a free person?
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:12.700]   It's failing to hear specific Christ-spoken promises moment by moment through the day
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.180]   that lets us sink so badly.
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.660]   Learn from our missionaries.
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.900]   Learn from the Apostle Paul.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.900]   Put to death the deeds of the body.
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.140]   Put to death the flesh.
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.060]   Put to death sin.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.860]   Supply the Spirit.
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.980]   That is, by setting your mind on the things of the Spirit.
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.860]   That is, on the Word of God.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.540]   Hearing with faith and trust them.
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.660]   And in this way, peace will come.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.460]   The Holy Spirit will flow.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.460]   Power will be given.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.460]   Sins will be slain.
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.740]   Satan will be pushed back.
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:58.660]   And Jesus Christ, who bought all those promises, will be magnified.
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.660]   Amen.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:06.020]   That was from Pastor John's sermon 18 years ago from April 7th, 2002, titled "Kill Sin
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.420]   with the Word of God."
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.140]   The entire message can be downloaded at DesiringGod.org.

[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:35.460]   Well, can I only be saved if I comprehend the Trinity?
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:40.180]   And if so, how much of the Trinity must make sense to me?
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.580]   So many people ask this question, and it's up next time on Friday with Pastor John back
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.580]   in the studio.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.580]   Don't miss this one.
