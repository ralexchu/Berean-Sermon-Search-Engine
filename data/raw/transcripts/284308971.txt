[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [ Silence ]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.120]   All right.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.280]   So you are at the Q&A.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.720]   So if-- make sure you're at the right place, okay?
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.840]   Let me start and then we're going to try to finish
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.080]   about five minutes before-- it's 3.30.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.840]   So 5-- about 4.25 is when we're going to end.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.520]   Give about five minutes to kind of move around
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.360]   or maybe you're going to be taking a break
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.520]   but that's what's going to happen.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.360]   And then if you have specific questions that you want to ask
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.000]   after the second session or maybe in between the session,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.240]   we can have a brief conversation.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.200]   But I'll try to make myself available
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.840]   after the second session.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.400]   If you have something very specific you want to ask
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.400]   that's more kind of personal rather than do it
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.520]   in the larger context, okay?
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.040]   All right, let me pray first and then we'll get started.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.600]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the retreat.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.120]   We thank you for the opportunity for us to get together
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.680]   and take some time answering some of the questions
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.360]   that our members have.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.440]   We pray that you would bless this time
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.200]   and any kind of questions or misunderstandings
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.360]   or anything, Lord God, that may come up,
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.800]   I pray that it would be a useful time
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.440]   to bring our church together.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.480]   We pray for your grace.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.200]   We pray that anything that is being spoken,
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.160]   that it would be according to your word.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.440]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.440]   Okay, so as I mentioned, I'm gonna try to stay away
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.480]   from subjects that are only gonna be pertaining
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.840]   to a few people.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.920]   I'm gonna try to focus on the questions that came in
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.680]   that I think is gonna be beneficial for everyone, okay?
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.600]   So the first question was about our denomination.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.080]   If you didn't know, we are Southern Baptist affiliated.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.240]   The very genesis of our ministry,
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.120]   we were EM of Irvine Baptist Church,
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.120]   which Gin was also a part of.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.840]   And I grew up as a Presbyterian,
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.120]   but I became a Baptist after I became a pastor.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.200]   And it was deliberate because I was studying scripture
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.040]   and the things that I was convicted about.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.800]   And then so I was infant baptized.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.640]   Then after I became a pastor, I got baptized.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.560]   And then so when we first came out as a church,
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.560]   we weren't affiliated.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.920]   It was just, we just happened to be Irvine Baptist.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.360]   I didn't know anybody in the Baptist circle.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.120]   It was just, it just happened to be in a Baptist church.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.120]   When we came out, we weren't really specifically attached
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.280]   to the Baptist denomination.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.280]   Even though we're Southern Baptist,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.600]   the Southern Baptist in our area in Orange County,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.680]   they're very heavily influenced by Saddleback.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.440]   And so the way Saddleback does ministry, philosophy,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.160]   their theology, I felt like we weren't on the same page.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.440]   And so even though we're Southern Baptist
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.840]   and I was ordained Southern Baptist,
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.800]   we weren't heavily involved.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.440]   Until maybe about five years ago,
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.960]   I was helping a friend of mine get ordained
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.800]   through the Southern Baptist Board.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.400]   And they asked me to come and help oversee this.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.120]   And I met the director of the Southern Baptist
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.200]   in our local area.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.600]   And some of you guys may know Dr. Michael Prout.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.120]   So it's been more than five years,
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.600]   maybe about seven, eight years.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.440]   So after meeting with him, I felt like,
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.640]   this is a really like-minded brother,
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.600]   theologically, ministry, philosophy-wise, teaching.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.840]   And because of him, we started getting more involved.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.640]   And so the first thing I did is I went to India with him.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.600]   To be honest, I didn't go to India
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.640]   for ministry purpose necessarily.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.320]   I went to India to really connect with him
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.160]   and with the Southern Baptist.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.320]   And I came back, seeing what was happening over there,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.440]   and then that's how we got involved with India.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.600]   And so since then, our involvement with the Southern Baptist
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.560]   is, it's still minimal,
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.760]   but he's always trying to get our church more involved
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.920]   because he wants to plant churches like us
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.200]   in Southern California.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.120]   So whenever he sees somebody who's like-minded,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.040]   he usually calls me and asks me to kind of mentor
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.200]   or meet with these pastors to help them.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.280]   So there was a church down in Corona Del Mar,
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.200]   and he actually taught in, yeah.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.760]   So Alex went and helped with the worship of that church.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.360]   And so he used to be a professor at Masters at Southern,
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.920]   at Talbot, and so he's comes highly credentialed,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.200]   and he wrote commentaries for Baker Commentary
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.920]   for First and Second Chronicles.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.480]   And so like-minded brother,
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.880]   so we try to help him with the church planting.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.280]   And so in that way,
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.280]   that's how I was involved with the denomination.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.960]   And so even now, Southern Baptist,
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.000]   the way that they are organized is local church autonomy.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.320]   So it's not like a typical Presbyterian church
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.160]   where you have the session,
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.200]   and you have all the elders meet together,
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   and they vote for things,
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.080]   and it's kind of like Congress.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.360]   So all the other churches are under this denominational head
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.240]   and then they give like annual dues to them
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.680]   based upon how many membership you have.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.240]   Southern Baptist has none of that.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.960]   Southern Baptist is local church autonomy.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.640]   So it's the closest thing to being non-denominational.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.240]   And so it's really voluntary.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.680]   So if we feel like this is gonna be helpful,
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.920]   so we donate money,
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.160]   and then we kind of collectively do things together,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.200]   but it's completely voluntary.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.440]   So what we've been doing up to this point is
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.320]   because we've been helping out,
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.360]   or we've been kind of involved with the local chapter
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.440]   of the Southern Baptist because of Dr. Proud,
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.240]   we support the local chapter.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.960]   So we give anywhere from 200 plus per month
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.760]   to our denomination locally to help like-minded churches
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.800]   getting planted.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.400]   Okay, so even if they're not connected with us,
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.840]   we get involved with that.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.400]   If there's any kind of like emergency relief,
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.080]   like a flood that happened in Katrina
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.520]   and all this other stuff,
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.480]   instead of just donating to just any group,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.280]   we usually take offering or take a part of our finances
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.600]   and we donate it through that group.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.240]   So at least we know that they're Christians who,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.800]   at least in Bible, theology,
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.080]   they're in like-minded context in our denomination.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.040]   And so Southern Baptist has a very elaborate program
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.560]   where they are able to respond to emergency.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.640]   So they will go and find a Baptist church in that area
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.880]   and work through that church
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.920]   to help the people who've been hurt.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.440]   That's also in Haiti.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.880]   I mean, Southern Baptist is the largest denomination
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.840]   in the world.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.360]   It's also the largest mission sending group in the world.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.360]   So it's larger than any other mission organization worldwide.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.640]   Most people don't know because it's denominational.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.760]   So if you're not Southern Baptist,
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.560]   you probably are not aware of it.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.280]   And so because of their mass network,
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.240]   anywhere in the world we wanna get into,
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.880]   all we have to do is call the denominations,
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.520]   do you know somebody there, and they'll connect us.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.880]   So as you know, Harry is preparing to go out to China.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.000]   And so we made contact
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.840]   with a Southern Baptist local guy there.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.360]   And so Harry has already met up with him.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.500]   And so he's gonna be the one
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.880]   who's gonna walk us through the town and show us,
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.840]   this is what's going on, these are the needs.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.600]   And so Harry is not gonna be underneath that umbrella,
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.760]   but he's getting support from them
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.200]   to be able to initially get in.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.480]   There's gonna be a community there,
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.240]   other missionaries who've kind of worked in that area
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.920]   so that he's not going in completely blind.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.160]   So that's our involvement with the Southern Baptist,
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.120]   it's kind of mutual cooperation.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.440]   And then because our pastor Alex,
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.160]   he's gonna be completely under the Southern Baptist,
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.760]   and he's gonna be under their care
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.920]   and under their accountability and under their support.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.600]   So up to now, the way that we've been doing missions
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.360]   is we were raising up, we were raising up our missionaries
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.040]   and were directly connected under us.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.320]   But we realized through the last four or five years
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.880]   of doing ministry out in China,
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.880]   it's too hard for us to support them from here,
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.600]   whether it's financial,
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.960]   whether it's spiritual or accountability.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.000]   And so they need to have a community there
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.300]   and we're just too far removed.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.280]   And so even though they are getting into a group
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.280]   where it's just kind of, with the Southern Baptist,
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.040]   they could be reformed, they can be charismatic,
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.880]   they could be seeker-friendly, they could be Calvinist,
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.320]   they're all over the place.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.520]   But one thing that we do know
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.680]   is they do believe in the inerrancy of God's word,
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.560]   and they believe the doctrines are theologically sound.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.800]   How they practice that is all over the place.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.600]   The reason why I committed to the Southern Baptist
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.860]   is because when I studied the history
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.040]   of the Southern Baptist doctrine,
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.760]   I didn't know that when I was
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.280]   at the Southern Baptist Church in Irvine.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.360]   But as I was preparing to figure out which denomination
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.680]   where I felt the most akin to in theology,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.560]   I realized that the Southern Baptist
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.620]   historically traces itself back to Spurgeon.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.320]   So Spurgeon, I think it was 1687,
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.680]   he basically refined, or I don't know,
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.240]   the right word for that is,
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.240]   he basically took the Westminster Confession, Catechism,
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.140]   and he's kind of adopted that
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.320]   into the Southern Baptist framework of thinking.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.680]   So I would say 95% of that is probably similar
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.780]   to the Westminster Catechism,
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.240]   except for the baptism part, right?
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.640]   And so I felt like that's me, I'm a Reformed Baptist,
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.600]   if you were to ask specifically what you believe.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.960]   So I didn't commit to the Southern Baptist
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.320]   because I looked at what's going on today
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.200]   and felt like I can relate to that.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.720]   I did it more for historical purposes.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.660]   But within the last 10 years,
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.780]   I've been ordained maybe about 18 years,
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.000]   but the last 10 years, there was a resurgence
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.440]   of Reformed theology within the Southern Baptist.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.880]   So when I first became ordained, there was almost nothing.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.720]   In fact, they were actually headed down the liberal path.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.800]   The last 10 years, the Reformed portion
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.440]   of the Southern Baptist have been reviving
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.080]   and they're actually growing.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.720]   And so more and more, there's other Southern Baptists
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.960]   that are meeting, or we're partnering with,
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.360]   and having fellowship with,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.200]   and other churches are popping up
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.480]   that have very similar theology as us.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.980]   A lot of that has to do with the Southern Seminary,
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.360]   with Al Mohler and that group
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.680]   that's kind of pushing that agenda.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.480]   Al Mohler, David Platt, Mark Dever,
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.720]   these are the guys who are up in the forefront
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.320]   that we feel like we have a fellowship with.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.360]   So that's the background of Southern Baptist.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.900]   And then once Pastor Alex comes under that,
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.960]   our mission offering, at least a portion
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.240]   of our mission offering is gonna be sent
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.720]   to the Southern Baptist because they're supporting him,
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.120]   so we're gonna support them.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:28.240]   This was asked by somebody who's coming
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.000]   to come to the next session,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.920]   so I'm not gonna answer this.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:40.720]   Our church, when it's asking the question,
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.680]   First Timothy three, is talking about
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.160]   the qualifications of an elder and deacon.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.080]   If you look at First Timothy chapter two,
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.040]   at the end of it, it clearly spells out
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.320]   that women should not be leading or teaching.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.840]   And so our church practices male leadership.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.440]   So we do not have female elders in the church.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.640]   I'm not gonna go too deep into this
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.260]   because it's gonna require a whole session
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.680]   for me to explain about that text.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.240]   This is one of the texts, like when I first
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.680]   became, went to school and I was a Bible major,
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.040]   this is the first text that I wrestled over with
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.000]   because it didn't make any sense to me.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.560]   I naturally tend to root for the underdog.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.040]   And I felt, when I first came up to that,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.000]   it's like, oh, how can this be fair?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.160]   Why would it be?
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.280]   In fact, the first pastor that I admired
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.480]   and I actually traveled to hear was a female pastor.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.000]   So I used to drive down to the valley
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.440]   just to listen to her.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.000]   And then when I was doing a paper,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.080]   and then initially I thought, okay,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.920]   I'm gonna really study this to make sure
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.720]   that this is not just prejudice.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.840]   And after studying and presenting the paper,
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.000]   I came to the conclusion like,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.040]   this is clearly taught in the scripture.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.960]   And then I had to reconcile, well,
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.360]   then how do I believe this?
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.560]   How do I practice this?
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.680]   Just to give you a short version
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.360]   of how I came to the conclusion
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.560]   of why this is being practiced.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.560]   In the end, I had to learn to submit
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.840]   what my sense of fairness is with God's word.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.520]   Because everything that I know to be fair
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.440]   has also been tainted by sin.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.280]   And so I had a conversation recently
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.960]   with somebody who asked that same question
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.600]   about like, how can that be fair?
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.360]   Because we naturally think if men are in charge
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.080]   and women are in a submissive role,
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.760]   then how is that fair to the women,
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.400]   especially after all the years of suffrage
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.000]   and treating for fairness, equal pay,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.360]   which all of these things are necessary things.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.200]   And I think good things for the society.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.320]   And when you come to a church,
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.560]   I mean, it just seems so backward to even say that, right?
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.040]   But the way that I've reconciled,
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.040]   that it made sense to me was,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.040]   even in our culture,
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.720]   if somebody rich comes into the church
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.920]   and we treat him differently
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.080]   because he has a higher standing in society,
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.360]   'cause he makes more money,
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.880]   maybe he's better looking,
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.280]   or maybe he's achieved more,
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.640]   maybe he have better grades.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.160]   I don't think anybody in the church
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.080]   would consider that fair, right?
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.920]   I think everybody, Christian or non-Christian,
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.520]   would automatically have a knee jerk reaction
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.800]   saying that's not right.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.600]   We shouldn't treat people who have better things,
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.560]   or you have better grades, so you get better seat,
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.600]   or you're better looking, so we treat you better.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.480]   We automatically think that that's wrong.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.320]   A CEO of a large company comes
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.040]   and then he gets special treatment,
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.280]   we automatically say that's not right, right?
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.320]   Christian or non-Christian.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.720]   So why do we automatically,
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.600]   when we say, when God says for men to lead
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.840]   and women to have a submissive role, right?
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.360]   Now how that plays out, I'll share in a minute, right?
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.720]   Why do we automatically have a knee jerk reaction
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.880]   as it being wrong?
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.720]   Is that a fallen nature that we're applying
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.920]   as how we understand good and bad?
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.800]   Or is that a kingdom principle?
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.520]   Because scripture says that in the kingdom of God,
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.680]   those who serve are the greatest in the kingdom of God,
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.520]   right?
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.600]   Because our ability to determine right and wrong,
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.800]   good or bad, was tainted by sin.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.080]   And so our sinful nature looks at people
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.880]   who have more money, they're better.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.600]   Our sinful nature thinks like if you're a CEO
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.440]   and you do great things, you should have special place,
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.280]   right?
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.120]   That's our sinful nature,
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.720]   that we recognize that we're fighting against.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.440]   So when we have this knee jerk reaction
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.260]   against this hierarchy of men and women,
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.920]   is that coming from a kingdom mindset?
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.880]   Or is that coming from a world mindset?
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.800]   So I realized that, again, my sinful nature
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.000]   is fighting against that because that's,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.120]   I'm learning fairness in the world that I live in, right?
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.040]   But if you look at the kingdom,
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.800]   God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:00.160]   there is a hierarchy in that God is the initiator,
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.240]   Jesus is the mediator, and then the Holy Spirit
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.240]   is the one who initiates, right?
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.460]   He's the one who kind of makes things happen.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.420]   It would be blasphemous to think that any one of them
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.360]   are qualitatively less than the other.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.040]   The Trinity is three in one, right?
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.760]   Three in nature and then three in personalities
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.920]   and the way that they function.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.060]   So when we look at the perfect picture of the Trinity,
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.420]   where they are, each one of them are submitted,
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.560]   but yet glorifying the other,
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.200]   and never will we ever say that God is better
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.140]   than the Holy Spirit, you know?
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.800]   Because Jesus himself said, if you wanna,
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.720]   in the kingdom of God, in the way that he created
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.660]   his mindset, right, in the eternity that we're going to,
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:52.660]   that our idea of good and bad, great and least,
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.900]   is completely the opposite of what Satan
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.060]   is doing in this world.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.920]   So when it comes to this hierarchy,
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.180]   God didn't say, you know, man is better than a woman.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.120]   He just says that he created man,
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.680]   and then the women came along to be a suitable helper,
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.640]   and so they're playing different roles, right?
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.720]   So when you have a conflict, when Eve was created
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.240]   for the purpose of supporting her husband
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.520]   so that he could create, right?
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.320]   God said to be fruitful and multiply, he can't do it.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.760]   He's completely helpless to be fruitful
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.860]   and multiply without her.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.440]   So she came to help, but when sin came in, what happened?
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.880]   He says that your desire will be for your husband.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.400]   In other words, you're gonna contend
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.440]   and fight against your husband.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.520]   So instead of coming along and helping,
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.960]   she actually comes along and challenges him.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.800]   That's what it says.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.160]   It happened as a result of the fall.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.320]   The man is gonna do the work, and at the end of the day,
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.720]   instead of producing fruits,
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.080]   it's gonna produce thorns and thistles.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.300]   In other words, his work is going to be hard and difficult
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.580]   because of sin, right?
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:58.080]   So God created order in the family for the husband to lead
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.000]   and the wife to be supportive,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.080]   and then the church is to reflect that.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.680]   Now having said that, that's the principle
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.180]   that we see in scripture, and it makes perfect sense
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.460]   because you can't have two captains on a team,
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.880]   or they're just gonna go at it, right?
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.520]   How is that played out in the home?
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.800]   There are some homes where the woman's personality
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.240]   is stronger, they may be more gifted,
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.600]   they may know the Bible more.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.420]   Does that mean that the woman,
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.480]   if you're gonna be submissive,
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.680]   that you should never open your mouth,
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.880]   no head, no opinion?
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.740]   Absolutely not.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.240]   It's talking about in our attitudes, right?
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.600]   And sometimes in the church too,
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.500]   there are people who are very gifted.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.800]   It's talking about the church should reflect
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.680]   the order in the home that God has created, right?
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.640]   If you look in the Bible, Priscilla and Achilla,
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.980]   Priscilla is always mentioned first.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.160]   And most scholars believe the reason why
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.680]   she's mentioned first is she was probably more prominent.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.360]   She was probably the outspoken one,
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.100]   she was probably more the extroverted one,
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.180]   and so her name is mentioned first.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.360]   In that culture, to have the woman mentioned first
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.800]   before the male was kind of like a,
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.660]   it was a no-no, right?
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.200]   So the fact that she's mentioned first,
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.960]   it kind of meant that she was probably
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.900]   more out in the front, right?
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.920]   But the husband is mentioned.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.880]   So what does that specifically look like
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.560]   in a family, in a home, that really,
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.240]   if we start making a box and it's like,
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.560]   this is what submissiveness looks like
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.920]   and everybody needs to follow this,
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.400]   this is what leadership looks like,
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.760]   and typically a lot of men struggle with
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.160]   what it means to be a leader because they look at
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.060]   somebody like me up on the pulpit
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.140]   and leaders in the church, and unless you have
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.400]   that kind of personality, you can't lead, right?
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.560]   And so people try to become more like
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.920]   somebody up in the front, and more than not,
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.960]   their personality's not like that.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.000]   So does that mean that God only wants
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.540]   leadership to look like that?
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.920]   Obviously not.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.860]   You know, leadership, biblical idea of leadership
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.120]   is to sacrifice, right?
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.880]   That's the biblical view of leadership,
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.520]   is that you sacrifice for the benefit of your wife,
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.120]   and then your wife submits and honors the husband
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.120]   so that he can sacrifice.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.580]   How that plays out in your home,
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.080]   how that plays out in the church,
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.000]   that's really up to the church, right?
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.360]   So I don't have this like cookie cutter model
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.960]   that every church needs to look like this
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.040]   and every house needs to look like that.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.360]   It's just talking about principally,
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.680]   God wants what he designed in creation
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.520]   to be reflected in the home and in the church.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.680]   And in God's wisdom, in my opinion,
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.480]   in my observation and experience,
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.240]   in God's wisdom, God created that way,
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.480]   and that's when there's most peace, you know,
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.920]   because that's what God intended to begin with, okay?
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.720]   Anything more specific than that, we can talk in person.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.960]   Okay, this is a big question,
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.360]   and I'm just gonna answer it quickly
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.040]   just to tell you what it is,
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.460]   and then if you want to discuss more,
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.320]   we can discuss more, okay?
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:04.200]   Cessationism basically is that the sign gifts
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.440]   that was happening in the early church
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.760]   no longer exists and does not happen today,
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.480]   and it ended with the apostolic period.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.600]   When the apostles died and the canon of scripture was ended,
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.160]   so everything is closed and it does not happen today,
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.400]   so all the charismatic stuff that is happening
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.960]   is just, it's not from God, maybe even demonic,
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.500]   and so that's what the cessationism is.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.700]   So even within the cessationist camp,
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.500]   there are different degrees, right?
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.860]   And I'm not gonna go into all of that,
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.360]   but basically in a nutshell, that's what cessationism means.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.260]   The charismatic, obviously, is where it's everything
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.420]   that happened in the New Testament,
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.600]   not only does happen, must happen today, right?
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.440]   Because why not?
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.980]   Because it happened in the early church.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.180]   If we want to be like the early church,
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.440]   we have to practice these gifts.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.980]   That's the charismatic.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:57.540]   Open but cautious view basically is that,
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.900]   again, and there are different degrees of this too.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.580]   There's people who are open but cautious,
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.420]   but they're more open than cautious, right?
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.900]   And then there's open but cautious
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.800]   where they're more cautious than open.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.400]   My view is open but cautious,
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.500]   and the reason why I'm open but cautious is
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.660]   I don't see anything in the scripture
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.600]   that definitively says it cannot happen,
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.400]   and I know all the arguments for it.
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.980]   You know, the dangers of opening up,
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.780]   you know, new scripture being written,
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.420]   of the prophecies being wrong,
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.340]   the tongues not being gibberish,
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.820]   but the known language,
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.300]   the apostolic period has ended historically,
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.020]   you know, and all the chaos that's happening
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.020]   in the charismatic circle,
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.660]   all of those arguments I agree with.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.240]   I got saved in a charismatic group.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.360]   I was discipled in a charismatic group.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.880]   I actually spoke in tongues for seven years,
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.360]   and then one day I just stopped, okay?
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.200]   And the reason why I stopped is because
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.560]   the scripture says where there's two or three
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.580]   to find an interpreter,
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.360]   and I tried for years to look for an interpreter,
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.120]   and I always found people who said
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.600]   that they knew somebody,
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.280]   or they prayed with an interpreter,
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.920]   and I prayed with hundreds of people who prayed in tongues,
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.480]   and I couldn't find a single person,
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.080]   and so as a result of that,
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.880]   I was no longer confident that this was tongues.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.120]   I can still do it now, you know,
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.880]   but I stopped doing it because I lost the confidence.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.840]   So if there's supposed to be an interpreter
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.500]   for every two or three,
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:31.000]   I should have found at least one out of hundreds,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   but the fact that I couldn't,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.460]   and then I've gone to healing services,
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.280]   and I had people who called themselves prophets,
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.740]   you know, and so I've spent plenty of time in that group,
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.400]   so every argument against the charismatic movement
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.480]   of caution, I personally experienced that,
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.640]   and I agree with it, right?
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.920]   So the question is then why aren't you a cessationist?
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.080]   To be honest, if I told you I was a cessationist,
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.600]   my life would be much easier, you know,
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.840]   because there are people who won't come to our church
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.760]   just so I won't, 'cause I won't say it, you know,
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.720]   because if I never said it to you,
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.320]   you probably assume I'm a cessationist,
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.080]   just the way that the Bible is taught,
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.640]   the way we practice ministry,
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.920]   but the reason why I won't say it is,
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.080]   is for that very reason.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.440]   It has to, I have to see it in scripture.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.520]   Just because I didn't experience it,
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.680]   just because I don't see it,
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.560]   just because it didn't happen historically,
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.280]   for me to say God does not do this,
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.800]   I need to make sure that it's coming from scripture,
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.080]   not from opinion, not from experience,
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.040]   not from inference, right?
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.080]   The only clear passage in the scripture
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.920]   where it says it has ceased, that the cessationist used,
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.800]   is 1 Corinthians 10, 13, where it says,
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.600]   "When the perfect comes, the imperfect shall pass away,"
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.480]   and oftentimes that perfect is interpreted as the Bible.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.360]   So when the Bible comes and it's ended,
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.280]   so there's no need for these gifts.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.480]   No, almost no scholar believes that that word,
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.520]   teleos, or perfect, is in reference to the Bible.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.440]   It's talking about the second coming of Christ,
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.320]   or the end, conclusion of our salvation, right?
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.320]   When it's taken into completion.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.880]   So when you take that text out of the way,
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.400]   everything else is inference.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.600]   Well, the way that the tongue's being used today,
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.480]   it sounds like gibberish,
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.400]   so therefore it's not normal language.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:17.400]   The gifts were used in order to qualify the apostles,
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.360]   so therefore the apostles don't exist,
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.240]   so therefore we don't need the gifts.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.440]   So these, they may be good arguments in inference,
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.720]   a secondary argument, but it's not the primary argument
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.520]   because there is no text that says it does not
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.240]   and it cannot happen, right?
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.400]   Does that mean that I'm open
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.400]   and I'm searching for these gifts?
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.240]   So open but cautious means I just can't say those words
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.720]   'cause if I'm gonna stand up in a pulpit and say,
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.600]   "This cannot happen, I need a passage,
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.240]   "I need a specific thing that's said
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.760]   "where I can be confident,"
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.560]   and I can't just come to a conclusion
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.400]   to exclude all, everything that's happening in the world
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.280]   that has ever happened and say, "That's not from God."
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.960]   I need something more authoritative than something inferred
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.680]   or because of danger, right?
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.560]   Now, if somebody said that they have prophecy
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.160]   and I've heard, again, John Piper, I've heard explained
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.480]   'cause he's a reformed charismatic
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.600]   and somebody asked him,
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.680]   "Well, people prophesy and they get it wrong,
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.000]   "so how do you explain that?"
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.360]   And he said, "Well, they're human beings,
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.100]   "so sometimes they interpret the impressions
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.760]   "that they're getting wrong."
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.520]   I was so disappointed with that answer
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.760]   because if you, in the Old Testament,
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.840]   if you prophesy and you got it wrong, they got stoned.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.920]   There was no, it's like, "Let's get this right next time,"
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.640]   right, they got stoned.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.160]   You can't say, "God said this," and then be wrong
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.280]   even 10% of the time.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.600]   If I came up to the pulpit and I'm preaching
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.880]   and even 5% of the time I get it wrong,
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.720]   none of you will tolerate that
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.880]   and you shouldn't tolerate that
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.160]   because how do you trust the other 95%
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.200]   if I'm so loose with the other 5%?
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.160]   You have to make sure that it is scripture,
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.920]   it is authoritatively coming.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.880]   So just simply dismissing it like that,
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.280]   it just kind of, you know, I don't think it's wise,
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.160]   it's not biblical, right?
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.440]   The kind of miracles that we see today,
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.560]   a lot of it is just kind of like somebody's leg
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.840]   that was crooked and it's fixed
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.320]   and then you ask them, "Did you know it was crooked?"
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.400]   He's like, "No," right?
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.240]   Or for some reason it feels better
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.840]   or they had back pain and it disappeared.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.360]   So the kind of miracles that we,
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.960]   I'm not saying that it can't happen, it's not from God,
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.520]   but the miracles in the New Testament,
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.560]   even the non-Christians couldn't deny it.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.620]   It was miraculous.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:44.000]   So my question is, if you actually have that gift,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.960]   why do you do it in private
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.720]   where only certain people can see that's contained?
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   Why do you not do it the way the New Testament do it?
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.080]   Go into the public, go to Angel Stadium
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.640]   before the game starts, get the people to come down,
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.240]   heal somebody in a wheelchair and get them off
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.800]   and see what kind of evangelism breaks out.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.540]   That's what I would do.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.600]   I would cling to God.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.680]   If this gift is something that I can have,
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.320]   and I did for five years, I beg God,
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.200]   if this is real, let me have it
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.600]   because I don't have to prepare sermons.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.680]   I would just heal people every day
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.980]   and then say, "Look," and then just show them the passage.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.440]   Like that's all I want to do, right?
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.520]   So if these things are actually happening,
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.160]   why not do it in stadium?
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.520]   Why is it happening just in closed quarters?
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.480]   And then if it doesn't happen,
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.280]   it's always because you didn't have enough faith.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.360]   It is not consistent with what I see in scripture, right?
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.720]   So when I say open but cautious,
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.600]   only reason I'm open is because I don't see in the scripture
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.640]   to be confident and say it cannot, does not happen.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.800]   I'm not gonna speak with my authority.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.600]   I have to speak with the Bible's authority.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.440]   But what I have experienced in the charismatic community,
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.040]   the majority of that I can explain humanly.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.600]   And that's why I'm open but cautious, okay?
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.320]   But I know I have plenty of friends who would say,
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.640]   "Well, then just say you're a cessation."
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.360]   I can't, it would go against my conscience.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:22.280]   Okay, this person is not in this room, so.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.040]   But there's a, let me just give you a short version of this
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.640]   because there's some people who say
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.520]   King James is the only version.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.840]   When I was studying through 1 John, I came upon this.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.760]   The King James Version is based upon a manuscript
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.080]   called the Texas Receptus.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.560]   And Texas Receptus, as far as we know it,
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.360]   is only about 800 years old because they found it around,
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.560]   or at least they date it around 1200 something, right?
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:58.720]   But we have the text that our NIV, NASB, and ESB
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.960]   is based on is a much older text.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.040]   And so there's a lot of arguments going back and forth.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.800]   So the King James only people,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.640]   they say that there was a conspiracy
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.280]   to teach non-lordship salvation,
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.760]   or to teach works-based salvation,
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.280]   and it was basically a conspiracy by the devil
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.440]   introduced to the church so that the salvation by grace
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.640]   is being weeded out and the salvation by works
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.680]   is being worked in.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.120]   So that's kind of like their base
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.320]   of why they're fighting so strongly against it
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.760]   because they think that King James is the only version
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.640]   that actually teaches salvation by grace alone,
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.120]   which is absolute nonsense.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.880]   So if you study the history behind their conspiracy,
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.600]   which is primarily being propagated
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.960]   by the independent Baptist community,
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.760]   and if, again, I don't have time to go into the details,
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.840]   but the independent Baptist community
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.840]   look into their history, look into what they stand for,
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.120]   and look into how they practice,
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.480]   and you'll have a hard time taking it too seriously.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.640]   I'm not saying the argument is not serious,
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.320]   but the conspiracy theory that's coming out of that group,
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.280]   there's a lot of other weird stuff
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.040]   that's coming out of that group as well.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.920]   Okay, so I'm not gonna get too deep into that,
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.520]   but there's clear evidence that the Greek manuscript
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.560]   that we are using for ESV, NASV is much more reliable,
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.960]   and the evidence to me is clear.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.360]   There's no, I would say majority of the scholars today agree
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.720]   that the manuscript that we're using today
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.080]   is the manuscript or closest to the manuscript
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.080]   they had in the early church, not the Texas Receptives.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:38.280]   Okay, this is a very big question,
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.240]   and I've been getting this question quite a bit.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.240]   How do you do discipleship?
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.760]   Some of you guys came from a background
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.960]   where discipleship was looked upon very one-dimensional,
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.020]   meaning that you had a leader and you had a follower,
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.720]   and the leader met with that person
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.440]   and discipled them one-on-one.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.640]   That's how I learned discipleship when I was younger.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.120]   I came through a group that was kind of like navigators
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:04.080]   and very, you know, and navigators, the Korean version.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.840]   So you had the leader follow,
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.320]   but on top of that you had the Korean culture,
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.960]   so it's absolute authority,
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.800]   basically whoever's older than you, right?
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.420]   That's kind of like how I learned it.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.680]   I had some issues with that
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.080]   because some of the things that they taught
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.680]   was kind of extreme, and they basically taught
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.920]   that if the leader tells you to do it,
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.000]   you just jump through the hoops,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.680]   and even if they're wrong, God will honor that
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.040]   because you're submitting.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.560]   Submitting to them means submitting to God, right?
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.880]   Now, I know majority of you, if not all of you,
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.940]   probably didn't experience that,
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.640]   but I came out of that and I didn't agree.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.860]   The Bible doesn't teach that.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.360]   The Bible clearly tells the elders,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.280]   do not load it over their faith, right?
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.660]   And so I came out of that group,
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.120]   but that was my understanding of discipleship,
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.480]   leader, follower.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.360]   So small group leader discipling the younger people,
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.320]   and then they get discipled,
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.800]   the disciple, and then the multiplication principle.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.640]   One disciple, two, two disciple, four,
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.320]   four disciple, eight, and then instead of adding,
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.560]   we multiply, right?
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.000]   So the first, maybe about 10 years of ministry,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.080]   that's what I did with the high school students
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.100]   up to the college and the young adults,
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.440]   but I started seeing a problem in that system
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.360]   in the local church.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.880]   In the college campus, it works well
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.280]   because it starts with the freshmen,
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.640]   and by the time they get to seniors,
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.680]   and if they've been faithful,
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.040]   you have a small group of leaders,
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.120]   and then people who didn't fit into that fell out.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.600]   And then if you came as a junior, sophomore,
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.480]   there was a clear hierarchy that was already in place
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.480]   in the college ministry, right?
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.720]   So Jim may or may not remember,
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.400]   but the problem that we had was,
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.760]   I discipled the younger guys to come up,
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.520]   and then we had a group of older people,
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.040]   Jim's age, that was in the group,
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.540]   and there was about a, maybe about seven year age gap.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.080]   So these guys were in the church excited,
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.600]   but the older group, you know,
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.400]   they've never been discipled,
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.720]   and then so it created this hierarchy,
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.120]   like, so every time somebody came to the church,
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.400]   who's gonna disciple this person?
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.800]   So if you clearly had somebody
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.200]   who could fit under that system,
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.080]   it's like, yes, great.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.480]   So if you're 19 years old,
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.720]   we have a 22 year old that can disciple you.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.120]   But if you happen to come in and you're 35 years old,
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.040]   like at our church now,
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.880]   we have 50 year olds, 55 year olds coming in,
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.880]   who disciples them?
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.680]   You know, which system do they fit under, right?
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.600]   So the problem with the local church is,
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.080]   if the local church is filled, it's generational.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.480]   You have older people coming to Christ,
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.640]   younger people coming to Christ.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.160]   So that, like, leader follower model
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.120]   only works in a contained environment
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.320]   where you have clear hierarchy
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.800]   of who's older, who's younger, right?
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.360]   But when you have a system of 19 year olds
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.920]   to 60 some year olds,
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.760]   and then people are coming to faith from all backgrounds,
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:46.160]   who do they fall under for discipleship, right?
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.940]   So I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that,
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.480]   but it does not cover the discipleship of everybody.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.920]   It doesn't fit everybody.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.480]   And then you have the kind of discipleship
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.440]   where it's easy to disciple singles in that context,
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.680]   but once they get married, it's completely different
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.800]   'cause you have to disciple the home, right?
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.120]   And married couples 'cause they don't have
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.520]   that kind of time, right?
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:11.800]   So discipleship in our church, when we were younger,
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.960]   and it was mostly young singles and collegians,
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.160]   that's what it looked like.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.460]   We had small groups, small group leaders,
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.140]   disciple the younger guys,
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:23.220]   and it was working great.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.400]   So up to about 150 to 200 people,
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.060]   we had a highly committed, highly mobilized church.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.580]   And when we were at 200,
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.780]   170 people in our church went out to China
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.100]   for short term missions.
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:40.220]   Out of the 170, 40 of them actually lived in China
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:43.620]   for anywhere from six months to a year or two years.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.980]   We had Friday night prayer meeting,
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.060]   almost the whole church attended.
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.560]   Every time we sent people out to China,
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.580]   the whole church would show up.
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.560]   So we actually had to tell them to stop coming out.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.700]   We don't need your support, right?
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.080]   We were just causing chaos at church.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.360]   That's how the church was like in the early church.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.940]   We would go out to eat, 100% attendance.
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:02.780]   So anytime we were at church,
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.180]   if somebody didn't show up, they got 15 phone calls.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.300]   And it wasn't because of our welcome team.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.000]   It was just our church was that tight.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.260]   When we started having problems was,
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.980]   as our church started going beyond 200,
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.180]   the people who were at the core,
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.380]   we have about 35, 40 leaders in the church
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.980]   who were trained that way,
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.620]   all of a sudden got married and started having kids.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.420]   So they started dropping out because,
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.280]   or taking a break, that's the term that's used.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.900]   They're taking a break because they have to take care
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.040]   of their kids, understandably.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.460]   So we went from 30 leaders to maybe about 15.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.420]   And then we went from 200 to 300.
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.980]   And so the small groups, we weren't able to run
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.500]   this discipleship program in it anymore.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.780]   And so the small groups that we were running,
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.660]   I started understanding why the large church
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.660]   is just pump anybody in.
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.060]   Because we have a small group,
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.300]   we have these people who are in need.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.180]   So we just get the next best person.
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.300]   And as a church kept on growing,
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.980]   that temptation was growing.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.960]   So anybody who has any kind of interest,
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.620]   any maturity, who speaks English
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.340]   and has a Bible they can read,
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.180]   you know what I mean?
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.540]   There's temptation to kind of plug them in
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.460]   so that they can serve, to keep this going.
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.620]   And so we came to the conclusion that we don't want that.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:13.580]   That's not what our church believes.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.620]   And so this is not working.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.420]   We're not producing leaders fast enough
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.100]   to deal with the number of people coming.
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.940]   And even the leaders that we did disciple,
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.940]   they were dropping out 'cause they were having kids.
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.100]   And that all happened all at the same time.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.260]   So that's when we went from,
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.880]   okay, this small group system is not working.
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.660]   We're gonna go back to the larger teaching
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.780]   and then break up into small groups
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.660]   where it's not discipleship necessarily,
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.840]   but we're hoping that within the small group,
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.220]   there's gonna be community and discussion
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:43.900]   and maybe some discipleship in some of the groups
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.100]   that are able to handle it.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.900]   And so that's kind of how we did it.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.420]   But there is a gap.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.380]   You know, it's not like we don't wanna raise up leaders.
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.720]   We don't wanna be serious.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.300]   But since then, obviously the church has doubled.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:00.300]   You know, and we've also sent out a church out to BMC.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.980]   Majority of the BMC were core members that went.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.940]   It wasn't like the fringe people.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.580]   It was like the core core members
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.460]   were at a church for 10 years.
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.860]   They packed up their bags.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.340]   And a lot of those people were people
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.960]   who actually lived in China,
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.020]   who were praying about going out to China.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.980]   And then when BMC was being planted,
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.540]   said, "Well, we'll go there instead then,"
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.380]   since that's where our church is doing mission.
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.820]   That's why about 30 people,
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:27.060]   majority of them were young singles or married people
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.820]   who went up with Pastor Aaron.
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.060]   So with Pastor Aaron, our former youth pastor went up.
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.780]   We had two deacons.
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.860]   Yeah, two deacons all go up along with core members.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:42.140]   So even the small group of workers who were there,
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.940]   you know, they packed up and they went.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.340]   And then, so we had this gap.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.060]   Okay, so we want to disciple the church,
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.000]   but how do we do this?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   So the way that we have it now, okay,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.580]   and again, we're not saying that this is exactly
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.900]   what we're gonna be doing for the next 10 years.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.300]   There's three tiers of discipleship.
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.700]   The first tier is kind of thrown on a net, right?
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.700]   Thrown on a net is like on Sunday, we're preaching.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.120]   And the primary way of discipleship for the whole church
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.260]   is through the large teaching and preaching, right?
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:21.260]   And it should be at some point in our walk with God,
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.100]   the word of God should be sufficient enough, right?
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.500]   It should be sufficient enough.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.060]   Because God did not put like, here's the word of God,
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.580]   but it needs, the word of God has to come to you
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.260]   in this avenue, or else you can't grow.
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.340]   That's not what the scripture says.
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.700]   And typically, when we talk about this one-to-one model,
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.060]   it's always talk about what Jesus had the 12 disciples.
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:44.220]   Paul says, "And trust the faithful men
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.860]   "who will be able to disciple others also."
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.960]   Even in Jesus's ministry, there were the multitudes, right?
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.500]   Within them, there were some real followers
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.580]   and there were not.
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.460]   And then the second tier, he had disciples
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:00.340]   who followed along with him, like Simeon,
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:05.340]   like his mother, James and John's mom, sister.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.900]   So we had a group of women who were following him,
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:11.500]   who were called his disciples, but they weren't apostles.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.100]   So if you look at Jesus's ministry,
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.420]   he has a public ministry to the multitudes,
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:19.180]   he has ministry for the few that he's been ministering to,
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.900]   and then he had a ministry to the 12,
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.500]   and even within the 12, he had the three
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:26.180]   that he really committed to, right?
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.740]   And they were all being raised up
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:32.400]   for the purpose of planting churches and their apostles.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.320]   When apostle Paul says, second Timothy 2.2,
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.620]   "And trust the faithful men who will be able
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.040]   "to teach others also,"
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.160]   he's talking to a pastor,
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.940]   telling him to establish leaders in the church.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.620]   He wasn't saying that that's a system
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.980]   that every single Christian needs to be under
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.300]   or they can't grow.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.220]   Because if you look at the early church,
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:53.380]   who discipled the 3,000 people who got converted?
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.860]   Who discipled the 4,000 people
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.500]   who got converted initially, right?
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.740]   So the only thing that is mandated in scripture
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.540]   that is necessary for salvation
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.660]   and spiritual growth is his word.
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:06.520]   Now, it doesn't have to be from the pulpit,
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.980]   it can be from one to one,
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.740]   it could be in a small group,
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:14.020]   but anytime we put confidence in human system,
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.860]   you're gonna eventually get burned
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:18.460]   'cause they're gonna disappoint you.
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.740]   And you're gonna end up going from church to church
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.380]   and group to group looking for another person
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.320]   to attach yourself to.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.340]   Is it wrong?
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.860]   No, it's not wrong.
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:30.940]   But having a disciple who disciples you
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.380]   is a great gift that you can have,
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.180]   but it's a crutch.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.300]   It's a crutch because God didn't say,
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.380]   if you don't have somebody committed to you
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:40.780]   to guide you, you can't grow.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.180]   God said everything we need for life of Godliness,
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.800]   we have in the knowledge of his son, right?
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.580]   So anything that we put in between that,
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.620]   we're adding a mediator that's necessary.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:52.660]   It is not necessary.
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.840]   It could be helpful, but it's not necessary, right?
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.340]   The way we approach discipleship is throw a net, right?
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.780]   And then the second tier are people
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.460]   who are responding and bearing fruit
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.460]   and we're aware of them.
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.380]   So they're serving, right?
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.620]   They're serving in the background, they're volunteering.
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:12.020]   And then the tier where we pay more special attention
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.140]   are people who are hungry saying,
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:17.580]   hey, can I be discipled for this purpose, right?
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.860]   If somebody ever asked me to disciple them
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.220]   and they're serious and I see that there's a pattern
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.080]   of seriousness in their life,
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.380]   the first thing I check to see is,
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:30.260]   are you being obedient to what you already know, right?
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.780]   Somebody came to me, you know, not too long ago
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.660]   and asked me to disciple them.
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.300]   And then I asked him, I went to,
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.220]   are you doing these things?
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.060]   And he said, no.
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.220]   I said, what do you think is gonna happen
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:44.140]   if I meet with you on a regular basis?
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.900]   I'm gonna ask you to do these things, right?
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.780]   Then he stopped asking me, right?
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.720]   So discipleship, sometimes the way people think
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.300]   of discipleship is somebody to kind of life coach.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.820]   It'd be great to have somebody older that I can pour out to
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.100]   and they can pour out into my life.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.700]   But, you know, the discipleship is teaching them
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.620]   to observe all that I have commanded you, right?
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:10.580]   And so does everybody really want that?
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:14.900]   You know, and if you do, yes, it is available.
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.260]   It's just not publicized.
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.420]   We don't just come out and say,
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.040]   anybody who wants discipleship to come,
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.060]   we have 200 people that come and show up
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.980]   and maybe we have 25 people
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.300]   who are discipling in the background.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.380]   We don't have enough resources.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.540]   So what I encourage you to do is,
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.500]   if that's the kind of discipleship you want,
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:35.340]   you wanna be challenged, you know, being fed, you know,
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.420]   in a larger scale where just being thrown out,
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.740]   like you want something more specific, right?
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.500]   And you wanna be challenged that way, come and ask us
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.820]   and we'll connect you to people
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.060]   that can actually sit with you and disciple you.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.260]   But it is not proclaimed, it is not just given, you know,
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.780]   because not a lot of people respond to that.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.060]   They want it up to a certain point.
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.420]   And then beyond that, they're kind of like,
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.540]   ah, I don't know if I, you know.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:01.740]   So I'm not saying that every Christian
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.820]   shouldn't be discipled, but for the most part,
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.700]   what's mandated in scripture is the Word, right?
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:12.180]   So if you're thinking that preaching of the Word of God
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.820]   is not enough, look carefully into the scripture, right?
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.220]   Because predominantly from the beginning to the end,
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.020]   God said it is sufficient.
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.860]   The Word of God is sufficient.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.700]   Not man, not system, not one-to-one,
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.220]   not an older brother, not older sister,
[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.900]   but the Word of God, right?
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.380]   And how we respond to that.
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.380]   Everything else is kind of like charity, right?
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.900]   It tastes better, it's a blessing of God.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.540]   Sometimes it's great to run with people,
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.620]   sometimes you're completely isolated.
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:43.180]   So there's benefit of being in a group
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.140]   where it's like, oh, it's great, it's better.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.580]   Sometimes it's great to have a mentor,
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.340]   an older person that's speaking into your life.
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.180]   And I've grown tremendously 'cause I benefited from that
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.580]   for a short period, about four years.
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:57.580]   I was personally discipled for about four years,
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:00.940]   but I've been a Christian for like 35, 36 years.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.180]   So who decided me to be the all that other type?
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:04.180]   You know what I mean?
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:05.780]   The Word of God is sufficient.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.860]   So if you have that, great, but don't make that a crutch
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.060]   that eventually becomes a problem, right?
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.300]   If you have a broken leg, you need a crutch.
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.380]   But the purpose of the crutch is to heal your leg
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:16.820]   so that you can walk.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.060]   But five years later, you're still walking on that crutch,
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:21.180]   that crutch isn't helping you anymore.
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.100]   That crutch is actually hindering you from your walk, right?
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.380]   So we believe the Word of God is sufficient, right?
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.300]   Okay, so that's, I said I was gonna give you a short version
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.700]   but I'll give you a long version.
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:35.540]   Okay, this person's not in the room either.
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:41.060]   Okay, I'm gonna give a sermon on this later,
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.980]   so I'll deal with that another time.
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.820]   Okay.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:49.100]   All right, let me address this issue too.
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:54.700]   Local outreach, there are people in pockets
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.780]   who are doing evangelism.
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:58.620]   But let me tell you, local outreach in our church
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.540]   is not a program, okay?
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.540]   It's not a program that we do Tuesday and Thursday,
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:03.860]   come out and we're gonna have this
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.260]   and we're gonna have this event, invite your friends.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.140]   I'm not against that, but the most effective way
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:12.900]   of doing evangelism is to equip people to do evangelism.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:13.740]   Right?
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.420]   So if you are being affected by the Word of God,
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:20.460]   you are the best evangelist wherever you are.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.260]   But when we turn it into a program,
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:27.380]   what happens is that program becomes the church evangelism.
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.220]   Right?
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:29.500]   And how many people are involved with that?
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.700]   Well, the outreach team or a few people in the church.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:33.780]   Right?
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.660]   Evangelism should be, if we have 450 people
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.100]   who are members in the church,
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.660]   450 people should be engaged in evangelism,
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.420]   not evangelism program on Tuesday night.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:48.420]   Again, if I was free from all other responsibilities
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.980]   and said, "Do whatever you want,"
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.220]   my natural heart is evangelism.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.540]   I like being with non-Christians.
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.420]   I like being out in the street, talking to people,
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.060]   missions, people say, "Aren't you tired going to missions?"
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.740]   But it rejuvenates me, 'cause that's my natural heart.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.900]   I don't have anything against evangelism,
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:09.020]   street evangelism, I wish we did more of that.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.460]   But the best way to do evangelism is to raise up people
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.620]   who are convicted to share their faith wherever they are.
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:16.460]   Right?
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:20.500]   And so, is there anything wrong with having programs?
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:21.340]   No.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.180]   Right?
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:26.060]   Sometimes having programs is very deceptive,
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:28.660]   and the whole church thinks that we're doing evangelism
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.500]   because we have a program.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.420]   And we've always said from the beginning,
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.780]   even when we were smaller and we would go out
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.460]   on the streets regularly, we always told our church,
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.980]   "Our goal is to raise up people who will do evangelism,
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.340]   "not have evangelism program."
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:46.620]   And that's also true about social justice ministry.
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:49.300]   You know, it's like, we're not trying to create a program
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.820]   where the church is doing social justice.
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.620]   That's something that, that's an outworking
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.700]   of a life of a Christian.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:56.540]   Right?
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.780]   So, does compassion need a program?
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.860]   Right?
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:02.820]   Do you need to have the church say,
[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.740]   "Tuesday night, we're gonna get together."
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.540]   Like, do you need to, in order to be generous,
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:10.500]   do you have to have a program in the church to be generous?
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.060]   You run into people all the time who are in need.
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:13.900]   Right?
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.700]   And then if your natural thought when you see that is,
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:20.060]   what can I, how can I, how can the church do something?
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.220]   That's not, that shouldn't be your natural thought.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.380]   Your first thought should be, what should you do?
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.220]   Why?
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.020]   It shouldn't be, I see a bunch of homeless people,
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.820]   how come our church is not doing anything?
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.740]   That should not be your first thought.
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.020]   Your first thought is, what should you do to that,
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:34.980]   for that person?
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.100]   Right?
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.900]   So, oftentimes people will come and they ask me,
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:38.740]   "How come we don't do this?
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.580]   "How come we don't do that?"
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.220]   Think about every pastor in our church.
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:44.360]   We're juggling 15 balls.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.380]   So, every time somebody asks, "How come we don't do this?"
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.940]   It's like, "Why don't you juggle this too?"
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:50.380]   Okay, and "Why don't you juggle some of this?"
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.980]   I read the scripture and you should just start juggling that.
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:53.820]   You know what I mean?
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:54.640]   You hear a good sermon, it's like,
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.820]   "Hey, can you juggle some of this too?"
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:01.780]   Who is the, who has more time and more energy,
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:05.140]   right, that can do this?
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.900]   It's usually not the pastors.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:11.440]   Because we're all, like, our calendar is full.
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.100]   In fact, every Saturday we have our elders meeting
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:15.980]   and then we say, "Hey, we need to do this."
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.460]   And then the next question is, "When?"
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.820]   Right, and we look at our calendars, like,
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.980]   "We don't know when and who."
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:24.700]   Well, it can't be any of us 'cause, you know,
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.460]   our calendar's already full.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:29.560]   So, we have to find somebody, right?
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.820]   And so, the best thing is if you are convicted about that
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.200]   and you want to do more than just individually,
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.640]   you're probably the best person.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:42.580]   So, come and ask us and we'll support you, right?
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:44.380]   But I don't think that's something that the church,
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.100]   instead, we need to hire somebody to do social justice.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.740]   We need to hire somebody to do counseling.
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.820]   We need to hire somebody to do evangelism.
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.380]   That's something that we want the church to do, right?
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.860]   The primary thing that the church is called to do
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.380]   is to preach the word in season and out of season,
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.460]   to equip you so that the man of God
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.740]   may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.380]   And so, just like what Pastor Aaron said,
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:08.620]   to be a committed expository listener, you know,
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:11.780]   also means to be committed expository practicing, right?
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.580]   Living, right?
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:15.660]   So, every time you hear God's word,
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.740]   it's our way of equipping you and discipling you
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.900]   so that you may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:21.960]   Okay?
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.860]   Again, you know, I can't answer all of your questions.
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:28.780]   If you have more specific things that you want to ask,
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:31.100]   having said that, does that mean that we're doing
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:32.380]   everything exactly the way we want?
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:33.680]   Absolutely not.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.140]   We're just doing the best that we can.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.720]   So, there's some things that you could probably do better.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:38.560]   Right?
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.380]   There's certain things that we don't do
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:40.540]   because we don't believe in.
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.300]   There's some things that we want to do,
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.460]   we're just not good at.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:45.020]   There's some things that we want to do,
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:46.380]   we just don't have manpower.
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:50.180]   But we're not gonna drop what we're doing
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:52.440]   to focus our energy on something that's secondary.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.660]   Just like the Grecian widows that weren't being fed.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.160]   Imagine how serious that problem would have been.
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.140]   But they're literally, their parents or grandparents
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.980]   or somebody that they knew weren't eating.
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.780]   It wasn't just somebody who was cold out on the streets.
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:07.980]   They couldn't eat.
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:10.700]   So, if there was any emergency that the apostles
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:12.580]   would have dropped everything to help,
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:14.060]   it would have been that situation.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.340]   And it's not situation, he said,
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.700]   no, you choose among yourself seven people
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:18.740]   who can handle this.
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:21.880]   'Cause we can't take ourselves away from the preaching
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.140]   and the praying.
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:23.960]   Right?
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.800]   The word and prayer.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.000]   'Cause that's a primary thing that we're called to do.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.660]   Now, having said that,
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:35.300]   you know, Rachel and Bethany,
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.060]   you know, like last couple of times,
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.580]   I'm sorry, not,
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:42.540]   Leah, Leah and Bethany have, you know,
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.060]   like we have some of the sisters in our church
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.220]   that have been going out on the street
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:46.100]   and they've always had,
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.260]   I'm already always encouraged when I see that.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:50.180]   So, that's why I posted up on Facebook
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.120]   to see if more people would join them, you know.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.620]   And it's great to see,
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:55.940]   like people just taking initiative
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.100]   and not just waiting for something to happen,
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.180]   but to take initiative and say,
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:01.460]   hey, we're just gonna go on the street, right?
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:02.820]   And then to share the gospel.
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.200]   So, I would like to see more of that happening
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.040]   in the church.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.940]   Just kind of organically serve, give, you know, evangelize.
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:10.780]   Okay.
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:19.480]   Yeah, 'cause I didn't have any.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:27.700]   I'll come back to that.
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.000]   Actually, that's the last question.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.380]   Okay, I'm gonna answer this.
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:32.580]   Meanwhile, if you have questions,
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:35.440]   and this being predominantly Asian,
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.300]   normally I would just ask you to just raise your hand
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.140]   and ask the question,
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:42.620]   but a lot of times either you will not ask
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.100]   or sometimes you ask questions that I don't wanna answer.
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.180]   And so, I don't wanna go off topic.
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.380]   So, if you wanna write it down,
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.860]   if you have something you wanna,
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.500]   doesn't mean I'm gonna answer it.
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.540]   If I feel like this could be beneficial
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.700]   for the rest of the group, I'll try to get to it.
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.700]   But let me, while you're writing this down,
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:02.280]   let me just address this really quickly.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:08.260]   One, I think I mentioned this last couple sermons.
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:10.340]   Part of the reason why there are so many pastors
[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:15.340]   who are being led astray is that there isn't enough filter
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:20.780]   for people entering into ministry to begin with, right?
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.580]   So, a lot of these pastors came into the ministry
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.520]   where they shouldn't have been in ministry to begin with.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:29.940]   Now, I say that because I've been in ministry
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:32.260]   since I was 19, 20, you know?
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:36.140]   And this is, I end,
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.880]   I don't know how much I'm gonna share.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:43.420]   Basically, I was an undergrad Bible major.
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.500]   And so, most of my friends in undergrad
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.620]   were headed into ministry early on.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:50.020]   And then, I was in seminary.
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.780]   And so, obviously, everybody in that context
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.020]   would head into ministry.
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:56.260]   And this is gonna sound arrogant to you,
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.740]   but I'm just being honest.
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:01.260]   The people that I was most discouraged by
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:03.840]   were people who were entering into ministry.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:08.840]   And the reason why is, if we were taking a class,
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:13.520]   20% of the class was based upon an honor system,
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.320]   that you say you read something.
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.160]   If the professor said,
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.720]   "You have to read from Genesis to Revelation."
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.440]   And then, at the end, when you take a final,
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.320]   they ask you, "Did you read it?"
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:24.560]   And if you said, "No," that's 20% of your grade.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.480]   So, if you happen to be an Asian that has to get an A,
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:30.420]   and you didn't read it, if you say, "No," you get a C.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:36.040]   I had so many of my friends who would come out
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.440]   and answer, "Yes," and then joke about
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.340]   how they didn't read it.
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.220]   Whether it was the Bible or a book that they read,
[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:44.000]   this was very common.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:44.960]   And they would joke about it.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:47.160]   And I would just stand there and say,
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.160]   "You just lied about reading the Bible.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.520]   "Sunday school kids wouldn't do that.
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.760]   "These are pastors for teaching."
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:59.180]   And it was very routine that this was happening.
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.480]   They were plagiarized papers, right?
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.760]   And again, I'm not saying every pastor is like that,
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.240]   but I saw enough of it where it was very hard for me
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:11.720]   to just assume that these pastors had integrity.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:12.960]   And so, it was hard for me.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.680]   So, there was a period of time I stopped going
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.200]   to these pastors' fellowship
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.060]   because I came back more discouraged.
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:22.680]   I had another pastor friend.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.520]   He said, "You know what?
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.280]   "This large church called me to be a pastor."
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.880]   Very gifted guy.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.960]   Great speaker, musically talented.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:33.280]   He was so good at drawing, right?
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.640]   And so, he would draw pictures.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.320]   And like literally, I'd say, "I have this idea."
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.680]   He would draw it on the piece of paper,
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:39.360]   and this fantastic drawing,
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.240]   like in a matter of like 15 seconds.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.720]   Very talented.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:47.500]   He was invited to a large church to be their pastor.
[00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:50.800]   And he's told us that he's gonna go out to Korea
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:54.040]   and have his last fling before he enters into ministry.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.100]   Because once he gets into that ministry,
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.940]   too many people are gonna, too many eyes are gonna be on him.
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:00.800]   So, I'm gonna get it out of my system
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.460]   before he goes into ministry.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:07.100]   He was a pastor of a large church.
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:13.000]   And sad to say, if I was to tell you
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.520]   that that was a very isolated incident,
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:21.720]   and that would've been it, that's not the case.
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.360]   It was very common.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.520]   When he shared that,
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.160]   imagine why he shared that with us.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:29.840]   He shared that with us because nobody flinched.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.000]   Because that was the kind of environment that it was.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.440]   And so, there are some people in that group, okay?
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.920]   Again, I'm judging them.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.360]   There are some people in that group
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.300]   who are seminary professors today,
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:44.800]   because this is 30-some years of ministry.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.360]   Some of them have fallen out.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.420]   Some of them are speakers in large conferences.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:50.360]   Every once in a while, I walk by,
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.920]   and I see their picture on a poster.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.220]   They were friends of mine when I was in school.
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:55.060]   You know?
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:59.700]   And I've been in ministry long enough to see everything.
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:04.020]   So, because I've seen enough of that,
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:07.440]   the way that people enter into ministry,
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.400]   there is not enough filter.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:12.280]   And so, part of the reason why all this stuff is happening
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.120]   is one, is that it's not the only reason,
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.840]   but one of the big reasons is,
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.640]   there's just, the entrance into ministry is just too easy.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.280]   Imagine if somebody wanted to be a doctor,
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.200]   and they went out and got a two-week lesson
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.120]   on how to do surgery, and they open up shop.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:26.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.840]   I'm not saying, I mean, it's exaggerated,
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:32.060]   but it's not that difficult, right?
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:35.320]   Secondly, though, even if,
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.000]   even if you came in with the right motive,
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.720]   with the right heart, and tried to have integrity,
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:43.060]   the way ministry is, there's not enough accountability.
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:45.520]   And once you become a pastor, you automatically,
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:48.960]   you're the spiritual giant of whatever group you're in.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:51.200]   And then, so you end, if you happen to be in ministry
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.580]   where you elevate human cleverness,
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:58.200]   and you're preaching, and you're giftedness,
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.400]   you end up automatically elevated to a celebrity status,
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:05.060]   and from that moment on, you have to play the role, right?
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.000]   So if you have a pastor who's saying
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.880]   and preaching spiritual things, and you're playing a role,
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:11.840]   it's kind of like formula for disaster,
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.960]   because he's a human being, right?
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:14.960]   And that's why, in our church,
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.620]   we practice plurality of elders, right?
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:21.480]   Even though I'm the leader among the elders,
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:24.160]   the elders in our church have equal say, right?
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.760]   When it comes to finances, I don't get involved at all.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:29.520]   Like, they have one, like, I just detach myself from that,
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:32.520]   just because, for accountability purposes.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:34.920]   We have a weekly meeting with our leadership,
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.960]   and we ask each other, like, where's your heart?
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:37.800]   What's going on?
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.440]   Like, I know the ministry that we're doing,
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.660]   but what's going on behind the scene?
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:43.600]   With our pastors, because they're paid staff,
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:46.640]   we, there's accountability system where we ask each other,
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:50.280]   we need to know where we're at at all times.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:52.640]   So every morning, we shoot out a tag saying,
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.880]   this is what I'm doing, this is who I'm meeting with,
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.920]   you know, and then this is how I'm spending my schedule.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.820]   And again, it's not to like, I'm micromanaging everybody,
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:01.480]   but it's for the purpose of accountability.
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.620]   We don't have a nine to five job,
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:05.840]   so we're not in the office nine to five all the time,
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:09.120]   so we try to have accountability when we make sure.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.840]   And then I ask the elders to look in.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.440]   So don't look at it saying, oh, your pastor's so assumed.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.320]   Don't assume, 'cause we're men.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:17.560]   You know, we struggle with purity,
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.400]   we struggle with temptation, just like everybody else.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:23.280]   So we need to have integrity,
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.000]   and the integrity is not just by determination.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.640]   It has to be from accountability, right?
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:32.200]   And so I'm one person in this church.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.120]   We have other elders and leaders.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:38.000]   They are, some of them are better at certain things
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.600]   that are behind the scene.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.240]   I just happen to be in the front.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.040]   You know, I just happen to be the guy that most people see,
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:47.360]   but they're just as vital to the church as I am, right?
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.440]   I can't do 90% of what I'm doing in church
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:52.280]   if they weren't there supporting me.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:58.560]   Does that guarantee that people aren't gonna fall?
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:01.760]   Even with all of that, sin is sin.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.200]   Sin is not rational.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.040]   Every time somebody's sinned,
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.240]   you're trying to figure out what led them to that.
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.920]   Your flesh led them to that.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.320]   You can know all the right things,
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.600]   have all the accountability,
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.020]   and then you get tempted and you do it anyway.
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:14.080]   It's gonna ruin your family,
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.080]   it's gonna ruin your ministry, you know?
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.120]   It's gonna ruin your kids, your reputation,
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.640]   all the people who relied on you.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.120]   And then you say, "I can't possibly do that,"
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:21.960]   and then you get right in front of it,
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:23.760]   and you do it anyway.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.880]   Sin is not rational.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.320]   Because sin is, you know all that.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.480]   Like people who do drugs, they don't think this out.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:32.600]   They know, you ask a drug addict,
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:35.320]   it's like, "Don't you know the consequences?"
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:37.560]   They know 'cause they experience it.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:39.360]   But they do it anyway, right?
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:40.540]   So that's our flesh.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:42.440]   So we can't give provision to the flesh.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.520]   So we have to, before we get tempted,
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.780]   to make sure that we block those, right?
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:50.800]   So one of the things that I do for me on the internet is,
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.600]   I only go to the things that I've tagged,
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.360]   what do you call that?
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.280]   Huh?
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.480]   Bookmark, yeah.
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:01.020]   So the places that I go, I just bookmark.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:03.040]   Because I learned early on,
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.440]   just doing random search is very dangerous.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.520]   'Cause you don't know what's gonna come up.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.580]   Right, so I bookmark everything that I need,
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.480]   and I just, usually if I do need something,
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.760]   I just click on the top.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.840]   It only takes me to those places.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:18.000]   Right, so you have to make provisions to make sure,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.360]   because those things are there.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.600]   So, you know, one is,
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.360]   some people probably shouldn't be in ministry.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.840]   Second, you know, the way ministry is being done,
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.280]   the path usually gets isolated,
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.800]   and there's no accountability.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.360]   And then third, even after all of that,
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.120]   we have to recognize that without the mercy of God,
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.600]   even with everything, without the mercy of God,
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.220]   you know, we can't make it, okay?
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.960]   Oh shoot, I don't have time, sorry.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.080]   (audience laughing)
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.360]   Sorry about that.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.080]   Okay, all right, you know,
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.000]   I'm really thankful that you guys are here,
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.760]   and I know that there's a lot more questions
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.360]   that you probably wanted to ask.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.600]   And I mean this, you know, sincerely.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.240]   Any Sunday, if you have any questions,
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.680]   it doesn't even have to be of the sermon.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.320]   If you have something that you wanna ask, don't hesitate.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.880]   You know, people have told me that I look intimidating,
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.400]   that I look angry.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.720]   You know, people have told me that I know
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.360]   that that's my resting face.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.880]   They call that RF something, right?
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:20.560]   That is not the case, even though I may look like that.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.640]   It actually, I'm very thankful when you take the initiative
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.480]   to come and talk to me,
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.840]   because I know that there are needs that I can deal with,
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.560]   but a lot of times at the church, our side,
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.600]   I don't know what you're thinking.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.240]   I don't know what you're struggling with.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.280]   And so if you actually come and take the initiative
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.120]   to come talk to me,
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.080]   that would actually help me to pray for you.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.760]   So I invite you, like, if you have other questions
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.320]   that you're just curious about,
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.840]   just come up and ask, or email me.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:43.800]   We can grab coffee,
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.640]   and I can give you a more extended version, okay?
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.000]   All right, let me pray for us, and then we'll dismiss.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.800]   Gracious Father, we thank you for this afternoon.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.960]   We thank you for our brothers and sisters.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.240]   And we know that I probably only just touched the surface
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.080]   of so many questions, but we pray, Father God,
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.280]   that you would help us as a church to be united in purpose,
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.360]   that even though we may be larger in size,
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.560]   teach us and give us wisdom how to build a church
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.080]   where we're truly running this race together.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.840]   We thank you, Father Jesus, in your name we pray.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:14.840]   All right, thank you.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.000]   (audience applauding)
