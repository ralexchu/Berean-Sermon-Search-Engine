[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11, we'll be looking
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.080]   at verse 32 to 35.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.960]   And again, thank you Priscilla for the testimony.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.520]   And again, Priscilla, because she was a friend of my daughter Faith, we're able to see her
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.760]   since high school grow and mature and then come to church and really give her life to
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.760]   Christ.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.720]   You know, hearing her testimony just again, personally, it's been a great encouragement
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.680]   to see her grow.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.200]   If you can, again, look at verse 32 to 35, reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.440]   And what more shall I say for time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.320]   of David and Samuel and the prophets, who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.360]   of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power of
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.320]   fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.880]   war, but formed armies to fight.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.960]   Women received back their dead by resurrection and others were tortured, not accepting their
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.560]   release so that they might obtain a better resurrection.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.600]   Let's pray.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.360]   Heavenly Father, we pray for enlightenment.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.080]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to guide us, not only to understand the content, but your
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.000]   very heart.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.760]   Help us, Lord God, that we may see a glimpse of your glory through this text.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.920]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.640]   Amen.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.400]   You know, now that the pandemic is slowly releasing, obviously we're not there yet,
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.960]   there's quite a few other things that need to happen, but there's more and more talks,
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.240]   especially in the church, of what the church is going to look like when it does finally
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.880]   open up, right?
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.320]   Open up meaning like fully open and we're back to whatever we were doing before without
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.960]   the concern of being distancing and wearing masks and, you know, having, you know, group
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.120]   pictures without wearing masks.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.840]   I mean, we're going to get back to that at some point, but now that we're headed toward
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.360]   that direction, there's more and more conversations among churches, what is the church going to
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.040]   look like?
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.200]   Because according to statistics, half of the millennials, half of the millennials, if you
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.680]   don't know, are somewhere around 39 to 40 and under.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.000]   And then I don't know where the next generation starts, but that's the millennials, which
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.880]   is a big part of our church falls into that category.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.960]   And they said that over 50% has either dropped out or moved away from their church.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.360]   I'm not exactly sure what the statistics for the other age groups, the X generation and
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.480]   the boomers and then the younger generation are, but, you know, because that's kind of
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.240]   like the demographic that our church is in, and it's a large, large number, there's a
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.440]   lot of conversations.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.680]   What is the church going to look like?
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.560]   Are the people ever going to really come back?
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.440]   And I've had conversations with few of my friends in other places who are just starting
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.240]   to open up and they're having a hard time getting their church people to come back out.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.320]   And so that fear is going to linger for a while.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.660]   And so within that conversation, there are talks about having churches completely different
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.720]   going forward, that in order to accommodate what has happened, that maybe we should just
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.720]   be online.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.040]   Maybe they don't need to physically gather.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.160]   In fact, there are more and more conversations about church planting that's happening only
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   online.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.880]   And there is no physical gathering in order to kind of roll with the punches and to accommodate
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.440]   what's going on in order for us to reach this new generation of people who are fearful of
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   gathering together.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   Maybe we don't need to gather at all.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.180]   So the concern that we have now going forward is what is the church going to look like in
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.100]   the next two to three to four to five years because of this?
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.860]   It's obviously we need to, we are concerned about that going forward, you know, but this
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.820]   is nothing new.
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.360]   I remember when I was back in college and maybe come in seminary, one of the biggest
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.220]   questions that they were trying to deal with at that time was the X generation, right?
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.120]   The X generation, right after the boomers, you have the X generation.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.420]   And they were saying that the X generation was having a mass exodus away from the church.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.780]   And we were hearing statistics that for every two people that converted, three people were
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.500]   backsliding.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.340]   In particular, in the Southern Baptist, for every one church that was planted, two churches
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.260]   were shutting down.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.340]   And so they were losing that generation rapidly.
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.940]   I was a youth pastor at that time, and I started to see the exodus, and I started to see that
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.820]   the statistics was, at least in the community that I belong to, about 80% of them attended
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.820]   church until high school.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.420]   But by the time they got to college, that 80% turned to 40%.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.300]   And by the time they graduated college up till they became young adults, they said somewhere
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.780]   around 87% that attended church in high school by the time they became young adults were
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.060]   no longer going to church.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.500]   So because of this fear, there was this stir.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.620]   If the church doesn't do something, within the next generation, we're going to lose the
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.820]   church.
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.820]   And that's where the Seeker Friendly Movement came in.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.180]   That maybe we need to do church differently.
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.900]   Instead of having the traditional church, since it doesn't work, maybe we can make the
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.980]   sermon shorter.
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.580]   Maybe we can make the praise more vibrant.
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.100]   Maybe we can have maybe more skits, just like we are attracting children.
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.480]   Maybe we can attract adults this way.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.340]   But the fundamental reasoning behind why the church started to change was because there
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.860]   was this great concern that we're going to lose this generation.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.540]   So as a result of that, they started challenging everything.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.060]   Do we need to have a sermon?
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.980]   Couldn't it just be a gathering?
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.020]   Do we need to have worship on Sunday?
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.460]   Couldn't it be on Wednesday or Saturday?
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.460]   Do we need to do this?
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.460]   Do we need to do that?
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.560]   Anything that wasn't absolutely crystal clearly nailed down in Scripture, everybody wanted
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.180]   to test the borders and just kind of, "Let's have a new church to bring a new generation."
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.600]   And this method, physically, humanly speaking, worked.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.540]   It worked because they started coming back.
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.200]   Large churches started popping up, left and right, where prior to that, the churches were
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   dying.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200]   Right?
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.020]   So we're in seminary being trained, and we're going into a field where people are leaving
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.860]   the church instead of coming.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.380]   But now all of a sudden, you have churches that are popping up, and you have hundreds,
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.880]   not just hundreds and thousands, tens of thousands of people are gathering together.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.460]   And so all of a sudden, people started to copy that model, and that seeker-friendly
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.700]   movement started to spread all over the world.
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.860]   We're in a similar stage right now where everything is being questioned.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.760]   Do we really need to gather?
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.820]   Do we really need to physically meet together?
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.100]   Now before anybody gets confused, let me make that crystal clear.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.340]   The very word for church means to gather.
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.300]   That's the very essence of the word.
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.140]   So you can't call it a church without a gathering.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.780]   Obviously, temporarily, because of what was going on, we had to go online.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.620]   And the reason why we got together as soon as we were capable of getting together, because
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.620]   this is essential.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.220]   The gathering of the believers is essential.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.180]   Not just hearing sermons.
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.700]   Not just participating on Sunday morning for that one and a half hour, just sitting in
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.620]   front of the television and watching this.
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.280]   For a period, we had to do that because of what was going on around us.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.860]   But the very essence of what a church is, is to gather.
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:49.580]   That's why we want to encourage, at some point, you have to get off online and need
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.580]   to come to church physically, because it is not the church you are experiencing online.
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.360]   It is temporary.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:04.020]   But when we look at what is happening, whether it was back then, fear of losing the church,
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.920]   whether it's now, where my guess is in the next two to three years, you're going to see
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:14.000]   churches just solely online in order to accommodate the fear of people.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.940]   This is nothing new to church history.
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:23.400]   In fact, if you studied church history in the last 2,000 years, you might be shocked
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.540]   to think, "How did we get here?"
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:30.560]   There was a period in church history where the top leader of the church was selling salvation
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.520]   for money.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.760]   And anybody who wanted to read the Bible or translate the Bible, they are the ones who
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.400]   were persecuted, burned at the stakes, and had their heads chopped off for questioning
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.040]   the church.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.080]   And we're not just talking about one period.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.600]   In 2,000 years, we can pinpoint many, many times where we would have humanly said, "There's
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.320]   no way that this church is going to make it outside the first century."
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:01.760]   But if anything that church history teaches us is that despite the failing of man, despite
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:08.880]   man's sins, despite man's fears, God is faithful to His promises.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.680]   You know, chapter 11, as much as we highlight these men and women, these heroes of faith,
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.920]   the cloud of witnesses that have gone before us, the real power behind what he is saying
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:24.640]   in chapter 11 is not that God found these faithful men, these few faithful men, and
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.120]   that He raised them up and did powerful things because He found quality people in the midst
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.920]   of all these people who are falling out.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.040]   In fact, chapter 11 isn't about that at all.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.140]   Chapter 11, that's why he says it is by faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.520]   By faith, Gideon did this.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.760]   By faith, Jephthah did this.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.000]   By faith, Samson did that.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.600]   If we look carefully at who these people are, in fact, I'm going to discourage you instead
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:58.000]   of encouraging you today, because it's much easier to find faults in people than to highlight
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   their strength.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.800]   That's just true in life.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.000]   You ask somebody, "What do you appreciate about that person?"
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.800]   You have to sit there and think a little bit, but, "What do you think they're going to work
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   on?"
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   "Well, I've got a whole list.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.120]   I've been waiting for the opportunity to tell you."
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.660]   Because it is easier.
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:20.880]   You know, what he says in Hebrews 11, verse 32, we have three sets of people.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.680]   We have the judges.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.040]   The judges lost it during the period when Israelites came into the promised land and
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.200]   they didn't have a formal government yet, so God would raise up these judges and this
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.680]   cycle of judges that would come.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.360]   And then it was about 200 years of that, and after that, we come to the kings and prophets,
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.800]   where kings are established and prophets are sent by God to constantly warn them and tell
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.000]   them that they're going the right direction.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.560]   So we're moving away from the patriarchs.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:57.040]   We're now talking about the period of the judges, and then he summarizes all of the
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.320]   kings and prophets by David, Samuel, and the prophets.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.840]   So it's like a very broad brush that he uses.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.160]   Now all of these things he kind of summarizes.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.480]   He's been going into detail about what these men and women did, but now he just summarizes
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.160]   by saying, "Who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.160]   promises, shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.440]   sword," and on and on and on.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.480]   They did powerful things in God's kingdom.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.640]   So our natural tendency is to look at, "What was it about Gideon?"
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:37.240]   Well, he conquered an army of over 100,000 with 300 men.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   What did he do?
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.480]   What was it about him that God was allowing him to use?
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:48.000]   Samson single-handedly delivers Israel from the Philistines.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.920]   What was it about Samson and his hair?
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.160]   So maybe we should grow our hair.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.200]   So our natural tendency is to want to see, "What is it about their character?
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.800]   What is it about their background?
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.840]   What is it about their upbringing that God was able to see their faithfulness and use
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.640]   that for his glory?"
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:14.760]   But if you take a closer look at who they are, I think you'll agree with me.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.200]   You'll come out with a bigger question than answer.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.760]   These are the people that God used.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.200]   So I want to start with Gideon.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.280]   Gideon was a doubting conqueror of the Midianites.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.280]   That's really what the title should be.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.600]   Gideon was a doubter.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:38.520]   So Gideon, basically during that period of Judges, the theme in the book of Judges is
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.200]   they all did what they thought was right in their own eyes because they didn't have a
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.480]   king.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.040]   And so as soon as they started to do their own thing, they started straying away from
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.760]   God and disobeying the commandment.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:54.640]   And as a result, the Midianites and the Canaanites and the Philistines, they would come and conquer
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.640]   them.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.440]   And after they are conquered, they are oppressed.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.640]   And in their oppression, they would cry out to God, just like they did when they were
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.520]   in Egypt.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.480]   And God would be merciful to them and raise up a judge, and through that judge would deliver
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.480]   them.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.880]   And so this is a constant cycle in the book of Judges.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.560]   It's repetition over and over again.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.480]   Well, with Gideon, the Midianites took over, and they were being oppressed by the Midianites.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:23.200]   So God calls Gideon and tells him that he's about to deliver the nation of Israel from
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.200]   them.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.200]   And this is how Gideon responds.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:32.520]   Judges 6, 13, "Gideon said to him, 'O my Lord, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.640]   happened to us?
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.040]   And where are all his miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, 'Did not the Lord bring
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.580]   us up from Egypt?
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.720]   But now the Lord has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian.'"
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.320]   You see, Gideon's response when God says that he's going to deliver them isn't, "Thank you,
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.320]   Lord.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.320]   We've been waiting for you."
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:58.400]   He says, "No, if you're really going to deliver us, why are we in this situation to begin
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.900]   with?"
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:05.760]   You know, I think a shortened version maybe of this is, "Yeah, right."
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.000]   I think there's a long way of saying, God says, "I'm going to deliver you."
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.640]   He's like, "Yeah, right.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.640]   You're going to deliver us?
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.440]   Why are we in this situation to begin with?"
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:20.600]   I heard of what you did in the past, but I haven't seen anything recently.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   But God is patient with him.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.520]   The Lord looked at him and said, "Go in your strength and deliver Israel from the hand
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.520]   of Midian.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.680]   Have I not sent you?
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.600]   Have I not sent you?"
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   You remember that?
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.680]   He says exactly the same thing to Moses.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.680]   It wasn't you.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.240]   I'm sending you.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.080]   Gideon says to the Lord, "O Lord, how shall I deliver Israel?"
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.040]   Stop right there.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:48.560]   That arrogance already, as if God was waiting for Gideon to be born and the Israelites were
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.000]   so weak until Gideon came.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.880]   Finally, we have our deliverer, Gideon, and then God coming to Gideon, "Would you please
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.080]   deliver Israel for us?"
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.040]   "Lord, how am I going to deliver Israel?
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:09.000]   Behold, my family is the least in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father's house."
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.040]   Maybe you got the wrong guy.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.600]   Maybe the guy down the street, his father's wealthy.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.680]   Maybe the other guy who's well-connected.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.240]   But the Lord said to him, "Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat Midian as one
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.240]   man."
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.280]   Now, I mean, think about the patience of our God.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.040]   Oh, yeah, yeah, right.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.680]   I heard of you, but I haven't seen anything recently.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.880]   But I will be with you.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.520]   He's like, "I don't know.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.880]   I don't know if I'm the right guy."
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.400]   And he says, "No, I will be with you."
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.440]   So Gideon said to him, "If now I have found favor in your sight, then show me a sign that
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.520]   it is you who speak with me."
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.520]   In other words, prove yourself.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.560]   The arrogance.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.720]   He's talking to God Almighty.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.200]   You would think God would say, "Okay, we move on.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.440]   Go to the next guy."
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.640]   And we wouldn't know who Gideon is.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.160]   Gideon is the guy who talked back to God, and he died.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.160]   The end.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.480]   But he's patient with him.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:17.960]   He said, "Well, I'm going to set out a fleece, and then make the due on everything except
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.960]   for the fleece."
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.960]   And he would keep that.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.960]   I mean, even the proof that he asked for is so trivial.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.960]   Keep it dry.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.880]   Then I'll believe you.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:33.440]   The fact that he delivered Israel from Egypt and all the plagues that he's been hearing
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.880]   about, sustaining this nation, conquering of Jericho, he said, "You prove yourself.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.880]   Keep this thing dry.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:39.880]   Keep it dry."
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.360]   And then so God's patience, he keeps it dry.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.720]   Okay, okay, okay.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.720]   All right.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.720]   That's a good trick.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.320]   Go one more.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.280]   Make just that wet and everything else dry.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:17:00.160]   I mean, think about even what he's asking for proof is so trivial.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:06.360]   God in his patience actually answers his prayer, answers his request.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:10.180]   But he wanted to make sure, because he knew what was in his heart.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.160]   He knew what was in Israel's heart.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.280]   As soon as he delivers them from the Midianites, that they're going to say, "Oh, maybe I was
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.480]   the right guy.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.600]   Maybe I wasn't.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.160]   Maybe my sin was I didn't have a high view of myself."
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.640]   And so God says in verse two, chapter seven, the Lord said to Gideon, "The people who are
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.000]   with you are too many for me to give you into their hands.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.240]   For Israel would become boastful, saying, 'My own power has delivered me.'"
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.040]   So in order to keep them humble, letting them know it was God who delivers them despite
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:49.640]   Gideon, despite the sins of the Israelites, he dwindles down an army of 32,000 men going
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.640]   against 135,000 Midianites.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.240]   He dwindles that down and he says, "Well, anybody afraid, you don't need to stay."
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.600]   And only 22,000 of them leave.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.080]   And then eventually he dwindles them down and says, "You go to the water and only the
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:11.080]   ones who drink and lap up the water, the ones that put their mouth into the water like a
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.760]   dog, let them go home."
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:18.880]   And the number dwindles down to 300.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.880]   Can you imagine Gideon watching that?
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.800]   It's like, "Oh, no.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   Don't put your face in that.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   Oh, we lost another one."
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:34.600]   300 is left after all of that.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.480]   And obviously God miraculously delivers them because he wanted to make sure that God was
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:47.720]   being faithful to his covenant promise despite Gideon's weak faith.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.360]   Look at Barak.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.160]   His name is not known very well because along with Barak is Deborah.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.480]   And her name is the one usually posted up.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.920]   It's like, "Oh, how come we don't have a woman pastor?
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.480]   What about Deborah?"
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.540]   Well, Deborah was the judge at that time.
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:12.200]   And God tells Deborah that he's going to deliver the Israelites from the Canaanites.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.240]   And so Deborah calls Barak and say, "You know, God wants to establish you as the commander
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.040]   and he's going to deliver you."
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.840]   And this is what Barak says to Deborah.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.800]   Then Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, then I will go.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.920]   If you will not go with me, I will not go."
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.160]   God told you to go.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.360]   It's not enough that God says he's going to go with you.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.120]   He said, "Well, okay, but I need you to go."
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.840]   This is what Deborah says, verse 9.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.240]   "I will surely go with you.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.280]   Nevertheless, the honor shall not be yours on the journey that you are about to take
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:51.920]   for the Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman."
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:59.440]   Because you couldn't be man enough to trust in God and you need a woman to lean on, so
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.160]   the honor is not going to go to you.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.520]   It's going to come to me.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.160]   Ultimately, it's going to go to God.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:13.440]   Barak, in his fear, despite his fear, instead of crushing Barak, Barak makes it onto this
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   list.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.640]   You're almost kind of like, "Why is Deborah not there?
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.040]   Why is Barak there?"
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.360]   Because the point of it was not Gideon and Barak to begin with.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:32.360]   Samson, man, this guy is hard to believe he's on this list of all the people.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:39.400]   I think most people, Christian and non-Christian, know who Samson is because he's a guy, single-handedly,
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.760]   who conquered the Philistines.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.840]   But I remember the first time preaching through judges and by the time I got to Samson, I
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:52.800]   read this story over and over and over and over again because I thought I'd missed something,
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.800]   but I did not.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.440]   So I want to show you what I saw.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:05.960]   Samson was a Nazarite who was dedicated to be set apart, to be for God's use.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.680]   So there were two particular vows that a Nazarite was supposed to have, to never to touch wine
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.960]   and to never cut his hair.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.760]   Well, he broke that not touching wine.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.440]   I don't know when he broke it, but according to what we see, it looks like he broke it
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.600]   as soon as he was able to drink because this guy is known as a drunkard.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:28.280]   Every opportunity we see him, he's drunk.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.280]   And he was a womanizer.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:35.440]   So the only vow that he, at least that we see that he kept, was he didn't cut his hair.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.080]   That was the only thing that kept him to his vow was he didn't cut his hair.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.160]   And my guess is it was probably because he was lazy.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.040]   You know, if you look at his character.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.180]   So in that situation, the Philistines have conquered Israelites.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.520]   God has mercy on them because they're crying out.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.240]   And so he is going to use this man.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:03.040]   You know, I think the best way to describe what Samson was like, he's a frat guy, went
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   to college.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.760]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.640]   He's going to be the cool guy on campus.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.160]   He's going to drink it up and he's going to have plenty of stories to tell.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.800]   That's how he comes out.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.320]   So if you're curious, go read it for yourself.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:21.640]   But I'm just going to highlight the point where Delilah shows up.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.640]   So he's a womanizer.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.360]   And Delilah must have been really pretty because the Philistines choose her, knowing that he's
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.800]   a womanizer, to get the secret out of this guy because he's been causing so much trouble
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.400]   for the Philistines.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.340]   Find out the source of his strength so that we can bind him and kill him.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:42.480]   So Delilah is deliberately sent to him and he falls in lust.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.760]   And this is what happens, verse 6.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.260]   So Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me where your great strength is and how you may
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.820]   be bound to afflict you."
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.340]   He should have stopped right there.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.340]   What did you say?
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.580]   You want me to tell you how to kill me?
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.620]   Now, if he was a normal person, that would have been enough.
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.500]   It's like, I don't know.
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:11.820]   I know my mom, my friends warned me about Delilah, but here it is.
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:16.380]   But Samson said to her, in verse 7, "If they bind me with seven fresh cords that have not
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.100]   been dried, then I will become weak and be like any other man."
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.180]   So obviously he wasn't telling the truth, right?
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.860]   He wasn't that dumb, at least not yet.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:33.540]   Verse 8, "Then the Lord of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh cords that had
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.860]   not been dried, and she bound him with them."
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.140]   She did it.
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.400]   She didn't even just get the information and move out.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.900]   She actually binds him with the information that he gave her.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.300]   And then now she had men lying in wait in the inner room.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.460]   And she said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson."
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.060]   But he snapped the cords as a string of toe snaps when it touches fire, so his strength
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.820]   was not discovered.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.460]   You would think by now, Samson was like, "I told you the secret, and you bind me, and
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.460]   then you call the Philistines?
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.300]   What are you doing?"
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.540]   That's not what happens in verse 10.
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:15.580]   Then Delilah said to Samson, "Behold, you have deceived me."
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.660]   She must have been really pretty.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:23.700]   "Behold, you have deceived me and told me lies.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:28.500]   Now please tell me how you may be bound so I can kill you."
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:35.900]   He said to her, "If they bind me tightly with new robes which have not been used, then
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.260]   I will become weak and be like any other man."
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.740]   So Delilah took new robes and bound him with them and said to him, "The Philistines are
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.740]   upon you, Samson."
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.580]   For the men were lying in wait in the inner room, but he snapped the robes from his arms
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.420]   like a thread.
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.020]   First time, it's unbelievable.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.660]   Second time, are you kidding me?
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.980]   How pretty was Delilah?
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.660]   You would think second time, "Oh, I didn't get away with the second time.
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.660]   Maybe I should run by now."
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:07.780]   Verse 13, then Delilah said to Samson, "Up to now, you have deceived me and told me lies.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.220]   Tell me how you may be bound.
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.860]   You're not treating me right, Samson.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.660]   If you say you love me, show me how to kill you."
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.940]   Basically, that's what she's saying.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:26.820]   He said to her, "If you weave the seven locks of my hair with the web and fasten it with
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.940]   a pin, then I will become weak and be like any other man."
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.180]   So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his hair and wove them into the web
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:39.420]   and she fastened it with a pin and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson."
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.700]   But he awoke from his sleep and pulled out the pin of the loom and the web, and then
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.500]   he conquers them.
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.780]   It doesn't stop.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.460]   I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:58.140]   If any of your friends were in that situation, right, you would probably beat him senseless
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.140]   and drag him out of that house.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.180]   But that's not where it ends.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:11.780]   Verse 15, then she said to him, "How can you say I love you when your heart is not with
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:12.780]   me?
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.060]   You won't let me kill you.
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.500]   You have deceived me these three times and have not told me where your great strength
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.500]   is."
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.980]   It came out when she pressed him daily with her words.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:24.980]   Daily.
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.940]   Pressed him daily is another word for nagged him to death.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.180]   That's what that means, right?
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:37.740]   She nagged him to death daily with words and urged him, and that his soul was so annoyed
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:41.540]   to death, they were both about to die.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:45.580]   Over with her nagging, and he just couldn't stand it anymore.
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:50.060]   So he told her all that was in the heart and said to her, "A razor has never come on my
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.840]   head, for I have been a Nazarite to God from my mother's womb.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.740]   If I am shaved, then my strength will leave me, and I will become weak and be like any
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:26:59.740]   other man."
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:00.820]   So you know what the story.
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.580]   So she basically tells him, shaves his head, he becomes weak.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.220]   And we look at that, well, was the strength really in his hair?
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.640]   No, that was the vow that he took.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.640]   That was a little connection that he had with God.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.620]   And then when he told her the secret and his head was shaved off, that little connection
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.060]   that he had with God, he lost.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.300]   And I think that's why he lost his power.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.820]   And then they drag him in, and then he repents and comes before God, "Give me one more chance."
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:32.220]   And that's how he conquers the Philistines.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.380]   Yeah, that's Emson.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.940]   That's the guy that's in this Hall of Fame.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.820]   Now you're saying, "Well, did I miss something?
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.520]   Was there something that I missed?"
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.500]   Maybe after all this, that something great happened, he redeemed himself.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.700]   No, that's how it ends.
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.700]   That's what he did.
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.700]   That's what he did.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:58.060]   And then God used this drunkard who was womanizing, blind to what Delilah was doing, and then he
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.160]   conquers and then he dies.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.540]   These men do not come out as heroes, at least not when we read them.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:11.440]   Jephthah, there's not a whole lot, but Jephthah, during his time, the Ammonites take charge
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:19.720]   and God says to Jephthah, and he pleads with God, "If you would deliver Israelites to me,
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.280]   then I will dedicate whatever comes out of my house, the first thing that comes out of
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.240]   my house, as a burnt offering."
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:32.540]   Well, they end up conquering the Ammonites and he comes back, and his only daughter,
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:37.080]   he only has one daughter, one child, one daughter that he loved and cherished, and she's the
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.080]   one who walks out.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.980]   And he keeps his vow.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.240]   And so if you read the commentaries, you know, people are trying to twist this.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:48.080]   Now, maybe it wasn't a sacrifice, it was just a dedication to the temple.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.080]   But if you read the story, it looks like he sacrificed her.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.280]   And I remember I was studying through that.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.440]   It's like, "Wow, God allowed this?
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.040]   How did this happen?"
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:05.340]   What's interesting is during that period, human sacrifice was part of the pagan worship.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:10.780]   So it could have been, again, this is my take on it, that Jephthah was already so compromised
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.460]   that human sacrifice was a part of their practice.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:18.060]   The only thing that he regretted was not that he gave human sacrifice, but that it was his
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.220]   daughter.
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:24.700]   But what's also interesting about Jephthah's story is God is never mentioned in his story.
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.300]   God never speaks to Jephthah.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.580]   God never intervenes.
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:28.880]   God doesn't say it's right, it's wrong.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.500]   It just happens at the end.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:37.420]   So at the least, Jephthah, even he is questionable, a big question.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.420]   Well, it doesn't stop with the judges, right?
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.720]   After all of this cycle, Samuel comes in.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.900]   And Samuel, the reason why he's prominent is he's the last of the judges and first of
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.300]   the prophets during the king's era.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:56.420]   Samuel is the one who anoints Saul and then anoints King David.
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.100]   So it says David, Samuel, and the prophets.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.820]   They're all mentioned in those two names.
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:08.220]   But if you look at how they transitioned from the judges to the kings, it's not a happy
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.380]   transition.
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.700]   This is what it says, 1 Samuel 1 through 9.
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.940]   "And it came about when Samuel was old that he appointed his sons judges over Israel.
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:21.080]   Now the name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second, Abijah.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.440]   They were judging in Beersheba.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.340]   His sons, however, did not walk in the ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain and
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:31.300]   took bribes and perverted justice."
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:36.140]   So the people of Israel got tired of them, this family, for what they were doing.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.520]   And as a result of that, in verse 4, it says, "Then all the elders of Israel gathered together
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:44.600]   and came to Samuel and Ramah and said to him, 'Behold, you have grown old and your sons
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.080]   do not walk in your ways.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.660]   Now appoint a king for us to judge us like all the nations.'"
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.060]   So it wasn't God's idea.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.720]   It was Israelites.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.060]   And so they started seeing all these problems in Israel.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:03.580]   And so their solution was, maybe the reason why we keep getting into this trouble is because
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.760]   we don't have a king like the other kings.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.940]   Maybe we need a king like the Philistines and the Ammonites and the Midianites.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:17.740]   And so their solution was a human solution, not realizing the reason why they kept on
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:22.300]   going into this cycle is because they kept on disobeying God.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.400]   They did have a king.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.420]   God was their king.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:33.320]   But just like all humankind, they choose to worship the Creator rather than the creation.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:39.680]   So they thought maybe if we had the king that our destiny will change.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.000]   Verse 6, "But the thing was displeasing in the sight of Samuel when they said, 'Give
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.100]   us a king to judge us.'
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.400]   And Samuel prayed to the Lord.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.340]   The Lord said to Samuel, 'Listen to the voice of the people in regard to all that they say
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.820]   to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.860]   them.'"
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:04.780]   God saw them asking for a king, saying that maybe you're not enough.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.640]   Maybe what we need is what they have.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:14.480]   And so the era of the king starts as a rejection to God.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.940]   The next person that comes up on this is David, because Saul obviously was not a believer.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:20.940]   He gets rejected.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.720]   So that's the guy that he chooses.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.100]   But David's the man that God chooses himself.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.840]   He's a young man who is after his own heart, he says.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.900]   So of all the kings that existed in Israel, they will say the greatest of the king was
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:35.900]   David.
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:41.900]   In fact, majority of the kings in Israel led the nation astray.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.060]   David was the man that they would lift up and say, "He's our true king."
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.220]   Only if we had King David again.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:55.980]   But of all the kings that committed sin, David's sin was probably the most heinous from a human
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.780]   point of view.
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:04.320]   You know what happens in 1 Samuel chapter 11, when all the kings were going to war,
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:09.220]   David was just kind of enjoying his success, and he sent his soldiers out, and he was just
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:14.500]   kind of perusing on the rooftop, and he saw Bathsheba taking a bath.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.540]   And again, he falls in lust.
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.540]   He's the king.
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:23.260]   He can do whatever he wants, so he commands her to come, and he sleeps with her.
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.300]   And basically, after that, she gets pregnant.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.340]   And in order to hide his sin, he has an idea.
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:34.380]   He's going to call her husband back from war.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:39.100]   He was a commander, so he said, "We're going to give you a special privilege," pretending
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.620]   like he's doing him a favor, and asked him, "You want to come back and sleep with your
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:43.620]   wife?
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:47.180]   We're going to give you a break before you go in because you did such a great job."
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:52.860]   And Uriah, being an honorable man, instead of going in and sleeping with his wife, he
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:58.020]   said, 2 Samuel 11, 11, it said, "Uriah said to David, 'The ark and Israel and Judah are
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:03.620]   staying in temporary shelters, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.500]   in the open field.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:09.940]   Shall I then go to my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife?
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:15.180]   By your life and the life of your soul, I will not do this thing.'"
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.300]   Because Uriah was an honorable man.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:23.060]   Even though David was trying to trick him to cover his sin, he wouldn't go into his
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.060]   wife.
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.700]   "My men are out there fighting.
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.620]   How can I go in to do that?"
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.100]   And so that didn't work.
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:36.420]   But David hardens his heart, and he needs to cover his sin somehow, so he lets Uriah
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:41.300]   go into battle, and he tells the other commanding officers, "When he's at the front of the battle,
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:48.220]   withdraw all your men so that he's by himself, and so that he will be killed, and so that
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:53.980]   in history books, it will say that he died fighting for Israel.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:58.340]   But in reality, David murders him."
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.360]   This is the best king of Israel.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:05.100]   This is the man after God's own heart.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:10.340]   A loyal man, a faithful man, a godly man, simply because he wanted his wife, and simply
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.380]   because he was the king and he was able to do it.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.940]   But you know what makes it even worse?
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.220]   Uriah was not any ordinary man.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:22.980]   He wasn't a commander among many commanders.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:30.500]   There were in the Bible a listed 30 men who were called valiant warriors for David, for
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.620]   the nation of Israel.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:36.100]   So these were the guys, if they went to battle, and if every other person died, these are
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.980]   the 30 men that would surround David and take the sword for him.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:45.380]   These are the men who would sacrifice everything, that they came up the ranks and were known
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:52.060]   to be loyal to David, who loved David.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:58.780]   Uriah was such a man because in 1 Chronicles 11, 26 to 47, those 30 men's names are actually
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.780]   mentioned.
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.500]   That's how prominent they are.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:10.700]   And in this list, without reading all of it, if you get to verse 41, Uriah the Hittite,
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:18.980]   his name is on the list of 30 people who committed to die for David in battle.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.420]   And it was that guy's wife that he took.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:27.100]   It was that guy that he murdered.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.540]   And he is on this list.
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:33.420]   We look at that and say, how can God choose this man?
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:40.060]   How can this be a man among heroes that we're to emulate and follow?
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:45.900]   Because the point of redemptive history is not these people.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:50.060]   The point of redemptive history is by faith, by faith.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:56.580]   Despite the weakness of their faith, despite their fear, despite their moral shortcoming,
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:04.580]   despite murder, God kept faithful to his covenant.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:13.220]   The only reason why you and I are here is not because God found potential people to
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.660]   keep the church alive.
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:20.980]   The only reason why you and I are here is because God was faithful to his covenant,
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:25.580]   that if you confess your sins, he is faithful and just to forgive you of all your unrighteousness,
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.660]   because he keeps that promise.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:33.940]   As long as we have faith to believe that Christ forgives us and causes us to continue to repent
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:39.100]   and seek after him, he remains faithful to that promise.
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:43.080]   You and I are not here because we were more disciplined than others.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:47.980]   You and I are not here because we were more faithful than other people, that we were more
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:52.740]   talented, we had better character, we had more morals than other people.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:58.340]   It's by faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:03.940]   That's why Paul, when he describes himself in 1 Timothy 1, 15, 7, it is a trustworthy
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.420]   statement deserving full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.900]   among whom I am the foremost.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.660]   Yet for this reason I found mercy so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:20.300]   demonstrate his perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in him for eternal
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.300]   life.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.020]   God didn't choose him because he was famous.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.500]   God didn't choose him because he was a Roman citizen.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.780]   God didn't choose him because he was being educated above all his peers.
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:34.580]   He said the primary reason why he was chosen so that when people see his salvation, they
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.740]   say, "God can save him?
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.380]   That guy was a murderer.
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:45.660]   He's responsible for the first martyr in the church, Stephen.
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.700]   He was beating up our friends, our father, our children.
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:55.580]   And if God can save him, what does that say about the gospel?"
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:02.100]   He was chosen because he was unworthy, because he was the greatest of sinners, in order to
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:08.220]   demonstrate that it is by faith and by faith alone.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.860]   And it is that same message all throughout the Old Testament, all throughout the New
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.100]   Testament, all throughout the end times.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.820]   By faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:24.340]   Anytime you and I begin to have confidence in our flesh, that's when you're in trouble.
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:29.740]   That's when you are in trouble, because you're one step away from the Israelites saying,
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.060]   "We don't need him."
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.860]   Go through the motion.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:40.020]   The desperateness, the sense of urgency to cling to him has gone, because pride has come
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:44.780]   in and we think somehow we can.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:49.020]   In 2 Timothy 2, 11-13, it is also a trustworthy statement.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.500]   For if we died with him, we will also live with him.
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.080]   If we endure, we will also reign with him.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.060]   If we deny him, he will also deny us.
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:01.260]   If we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:06.720]   I mean, what he says here is a perfect example of Israel's history.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:13.060]   God made a covenant, a unilateral covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:17.100]   And when they sinned, they saw the consequences.
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.540]   The enemies came and conquered them.
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.680]   And so when they denied him, judgment came.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.660]   And yet, they were faithless.
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:31.420]   God still remained faithful, because he made that covenant.
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:37.940]   The only thing that keeps us connected to this God is by faith, by faith.
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.420]   Do we believe this God?
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.660]   Are we connected to this God?
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.620]   Are we abiding with this God?
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:51.140]   Because the only strength that we have for us to persevere is by faith.
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:54.180]   That's why our confidence is not in man.
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.140]   That's why we don't run to human resources.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:01.540]   That's why we don't simply copy what we think is successful out there.
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:06.820]   We just do what the Word of God says, in season and out of season.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:14.260]   And let God's children hear the voice of Christ, and those who are his will follow him.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.860]   That's our ministry philosophy in a nutshell.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:21.220]   Because it's not in me, it's not in you, and it's not in them.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.600]   It's in Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.020]   So my prayer is, again, I'm going to ask the praise team to come up, to take a few minutes
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.060]   to pray.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.980]   That we would take some time to reflect and pray, where is your confidence?
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:38.500]   Who do you run to when things go wrong?
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.220]   Where do you find your greatest comfort?
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.260]   What are you seeking?
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.260]   Are you asking God?
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.260]   Are you seeking him?
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.020]   Is he your refuge?
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:49.220]   Is he your ultimate hope?
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.660]   Have we put our confidence in man?
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:56.540]   So again, as our worship team takes some time to lead, let's take some time to reflect and
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:02.020]   to pray and recalibrate our hearts, where Christ and Christ alone will be exalted.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.000]   So let's take some time to pray.
