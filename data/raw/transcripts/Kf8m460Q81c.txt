[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.280]   Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.280]   If you guys are here for the first time,
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.280]   we do invite you to go out to the welcome table,
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.280]   which is in the back of the courtyard after we're done.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.280]   You can find out more information about the church
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.280]   We do have a lunch in two weeks, June 26th,
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.280]   for all newcomers.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.280]   So if this applies to you, by all means,
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.280]   please do sign up and join us
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.280]   for just a good time of fellowship.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.280]   As you guys know, our Bible study just finished
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.280]   for this term, for this week,
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.280]   but we do have summer prairies and prayer nights,
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.280]   both in June and July.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.280]   So the next one that's coming up is Friday,
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.280]   the 24th, so please do plan around that.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.280]   Consider that just as important as a time of Bible study.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.280]   So please do prepare for that.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.280]   For you guys who may have forgotten,
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.280]   Father's Day is next Sunday.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.280]   And so this is a reminder for you guys
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.280]   to just write cards and things
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.280]   for the fathers that are in your life.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.280]   And we will have a special photo booth set up outside
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.280]   for you guys to just take a look at.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.280]   A photo booth set up outside next Sunday.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.280]   Just a couple other things that are a little bit more
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.280]   timely and urgent.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.280]   For you guys who are doing the safety training,
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.280]   if you're working with our children,
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.280]   that's gonna be here in the sanctuary today at 1 p.m.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.280]   Okay?
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.280]   Last couple announcements.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.280]   Our family ministry retreat this summer,
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.280]   the theme has been set for just strengthening
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.280]   the Christian marriage.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.280]   And today is the last day for you to register
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.280]   at the discounted price.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.280]   It's gonna go up by a lot, okay, after today.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.280]   So please do sign up for that.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.280]   Actually, I'm just kidding.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.280]   It's 50 bucks.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.280]   But hey, gas prices have gone up.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.280]   Okay, so August 12th to the 14th.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.280]   VBS signups are still going on,
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   and we're gonna close them soon.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.280]   Your kid may squeak in,
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.280]   but we're ordering the t-shirts very soon.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.280]   So if you don't have your child registered,
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.280]   and I feel moved with compassion,
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.280]   I might give your tiny child my shirt,
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.280]   and you don't want that.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.280]   Okay, so please do get going on those registrations.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.280]   Okay, so after we have a time of offering,
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.280]   before the sermon, we're gonna have
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.280]   just five of our newborns to the church
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.280]   introduced to the church family.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.280]   And so right after the praise time,
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.280]   if I can ask the parents of the new children
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.280]   just to come up toward the front,
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.280]   that would be great.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.280]   All right, so if you have an offering physically prepared,
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.280]   there's a box in the back.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.280]   If not, you can give your tithes
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.280]   and your gifts to the Lord electronically.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.280]   So let me pray, and we'll give you a minute,
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.280]   and we'll get started.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.280]   Father, we are very thankful,
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.280]   and what a privilege it is for us
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.280]   to gather together this Sunday morning
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.280]   to give you the praise that you do.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.280]   And I pray that you would cause us this morning
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.280]   just to reflect deeply on the great gift of salvation,
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.280]   and that we would leave here
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.280]   just an empowered and joy-filled people.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.280]   And we know, Lord God, that it's your fruit,
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.280]   it's your word that bears fruit in our lives,
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.280]   and so would you honor this time.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.280]   And as we give our tithes and offerings to you,
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   Lord, help us just to be faithful stewards
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.280]   with all that you've provided for us,
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.280]   and we acknowledge at this time
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.280]   that every good and perfect gift is from you.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.280]   So we thank you, Lord,
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.280]   and would you be honored this morning.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.280]   We pray all this as you say.

[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.280]   Church family, let's all rise together.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.280]   It seems a little bit more cozy today.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.280]   Maybe people are parking,
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.280]   but we're gonna go ahead and sing to the Lord.

[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.280]   Whose love is mighty and so much stronger

[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:38.280]   That I would be set free
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:45.280]   Oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.280]   Sing it out, who brings our chaos?
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.280]   Who brings our chaos back into order?
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:03.280]   Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:09.280]   The King of glory, the King above all kings
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.280]   This Lord who rules the nations
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:17.280]   Who rules the nations with truth and justice
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:22.280]   Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:27.280]   The King of glory, the King above all kings
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.280]   This is amazing grace
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.280]   This is amazing grace
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.280]   This is unfailing love
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.280]   That you would take my place
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:49.280]   That you would bear my cross
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.280]   You would lay down your life
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:59.280]   That I would be set free
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:06.280]   Oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.280]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:19.280]   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.280]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.280]   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.280]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.280]   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.280]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.280]   Worthy, worthy, worthy
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.280]   This is amazing grace
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:55.280]   This is unfailing love
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.280]   That you would take my place
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:05.280]   That you would bear my cross
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   You would lay down your life
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   That I would be set free
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:23.280]   Oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:42.280]   [Instrumental]
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.280]   Amen
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.280]   Praise the Lord
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:02.280]   His mercy is more
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:08.280]   Stronger than darkness, new every morn
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:15.280]   Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:21.280]   [Instrumental]
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.280]   What love could remember
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:30.280]   What love could remember, no wrongs we have done
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:35.280]   Omniscient, all-knowing, He counts not their sum
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:42.280]   Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:49.280]   Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:54.280]   Praise the Lord
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:59.280]   His mercy is more
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:07.280]   Stronger than darkness, new every morn
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.280]   Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:23.280]   [Instrumental]
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.280]   What patience would wait as we constantly roam
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:34.280]   What Father so tender is calling us home
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:41.280]   He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:48.280]   Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.280]   Praise the Lord
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:58.280]   His mercy is more
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:06.280]   Stronger than darkness, new every morn
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:12.280]   Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:19.280]   [Instrumental]
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.280]   What riches of kindness
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:27.280]   What riches of kindness He lavished on us
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:33.280]   His blood was the payment, His life was the cost
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:40.280]   We stood 'neath the death we could never afford
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:47.280]   Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:54.280]   Praise the Lord
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:00.280]   His mercy is more
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:07.280]   Stronger than darkness, new every morn
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.280]   Our sins they are many, and one more time praise the Lord
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:17.280]   Praise the Lord
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:22.280]   His mercy is more
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:30.280]   Stronger than darkness, new every morn
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:35.280]   Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:41.280]   Stronger than darkness, new every morn
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:48.280]   Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.280]   Amen. You may be seated.

[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.280]   >> We are very blessed this morning just to meet these five
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.280]   wonderful, beautiful little children.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   Our prayer collectively this morning is that they would grow to know you, to love you.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   As this world gets darker, these children will be raised up to shine brightly.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:07.280]   Lord, that they would know how to fight, when to fight, and why to fight when it comes to
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:13.280]   really building your church. Help them to love you, love your church, and love your people,
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.280]   and love the lost. And we know that that is only possible if they know you, and know you intimately.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.280]   And so we pray for wisdom over these parents, that they would steward their children well.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:31.280]   But we pray that salvation is from you alone, that you would save them and use them for the mighty,
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.280]   for the glory of your son.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.280]   So in the mighty name of Jesus we pray. Amen.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:45.280]   [Applause]
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   >> This morning's passage is going to be out of Jeremiah 17, 5 through 11.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:56.280]   So let me start there. Jeremiah 17, 5 through 11.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:04.280]   And it reads, "Thus says the Lord, 'Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind,
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:08.280]   and makes flesh his strength, and whose heart turns away from the Lord.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:15.280]   For he will be like a bush in the desert, and will not see when prosperity comes,
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:20.280]   but will live in stony wastes in the wilderness, a land of salt, without inhabitant.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:26.280]   Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, and whose trust is the Lord.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.280]   For he will be like a tree planted by the water, that extends its roots by a stream,
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.280]   and will not fear when the heat comes. But its leaves will be green,
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:38.280]   and it will not be anxious in a year of drought, nor cease to yield fruit.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.280]   The heart is more deceitful than all else, and is desperately sick.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:48.280]   Who can understand it? I, the Lord, search the heart, I test the mind,
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:53.280]   even to give to each man according to his ways, according to the results of his deeds.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:58.280]   And as a partridge that hatches eggs which it has not laid, so is he who makes a fortune.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:05.280]   But unjustly, in the midst of his days it will forsake him, and in the end he will be a fool."
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:14.280]   About eight years or so ago, I was counseling a young lady who was dating a seminary student.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:20.280]   The lady's boyfriend was preparing to be a pastor, or perhaps a missionary overseas.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:26.280]   And so the lady asked me what challenges they should expect to face as a ministry family.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:32.280]   So I started to share about some of the common challenges, the standard normal ones.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:38.280]   I mentioned that sometimes she might feel like she's sharing her husband with the church,
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:43.280]   that there would be perhaps seasons where financially things might be tight.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:50.280]   Perhaps they would not be able to comfortably root down and build a life like most of her peers.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:57.280]   I started with those, but then I went into some of the more weighty and painful challenges that would really test them.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:05.280]   More than finance and time and busyness, I told them that God will make an example of your life.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   And no matter what the circumstance, no matter how he makes an example of your life,
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   that you are called to present God as holy.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.280]   You are to make sure that when you are saying, "Thus saith the Lord,"
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:29.280]   it's not just accurate in theology and doctrine only, but also in your life response to those sanctifying circumstances.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:36.280]   And these circumstances are usually excruciating and very painful.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:43.280]   And that even if you were to be faithful in presenting God as holy in both your life and doctrine,
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:53.280]   the response of those you're preaching to, of those you're shepherding, may still be rejection, scorn, and even hatred.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.280]   And you may see people you love walk away from the faith.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:08.280]   So I shared this with this young couple, not only because I saw these real-life sermons lived out in the lives of pastors around me,
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:12.280]   but because I also saw this pattern in the scriptures.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:22.280]   If you read, especially through the Old Testament, you'll often see God using lives of his chosen prophets as like a living object lesson.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   Sermons and prophecies would not just be preached, but would also be lived out in the prophet's life.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.280]   Hosea was called to marry a harlot.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   Ezekiel had to lay on his left side for 390 days to symbolize the burden of carrying the northern kingdom's sins.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:54.280]   And then after those 390 days, God told him to flip, and he had to lie on his right side for 40 days for the sins of Judah.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:33:07.280]   In Isaiah chapter 20, you'll read that Isaiah preached naked and barefoot for three years as a sign of the shame that was to come on Egypt and Cush.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:13.280]   The New Testament refers to Noah as a preacher of righteousness.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:19.280]   He undertook the task of building an ark over the course of a hundred years.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:27.280]   But there's not much evidence that his message of doom and gloom was heeded by anybody outside of his family.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:32.280]   People probably just assumed he was crazy.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   Our text today comes from Jeremiah's prophecy.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.280]   Now, Jeremiah had a ministry that none of us would ever want.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:47.280]   God made a visual of Jeremiah's life on numerous occasions that spanned several decades.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:57.280]   And I'm going to spend a moment talking about an event in Jeremiah 13, because it's important for the understanding of today's context of the passage today.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   So in Jeremiah 13, the prophet Jeremiah is told to buy a linen waistband.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   The ESV calls it a loincloth.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:12.280]   We're not familiar with either, really, so you can think of it as like a fancy belt or sash.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:18.280]   And this linen waistband was a decorative belt associated with a priest's garment.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:25.280]   And such a linen belt was a sign of dignity and nobility, and it symbolized a priest being set apart.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.280]   And so God tells Jeremiah to buy one, and so he does.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   But then he commands Jeremiah to do a very strange thing.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:43.280]   Jeremiah is commanded to go to the Euphrates River and to bury the linen belt, this waistband, in the crevice of a rock.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.280]   And so let me read this account for you.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.280]   Jeremiah 13, 5-7.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:51.280]   "So I went and hid it by the Euphrates as the Lord had commanded me.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:59.280]   And after many days the Lord said to me, 'Arise, go to the Euphrates and take from there the waistband which I commanded you to hide there.'
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:06.280]   Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and I took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it, and lo, the waistband was ruined.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.280]   It was totally worthless."
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:14.280]   So this rotten waistband symbolized God's people, the people of Judah.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.280]   They were supposed to be a people set apart.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.280]   They were supposed to be a people dignified and holy.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:28.280]   They were a people created by God and for God to love God and to serve God.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:34.280]   And as such, they were to be a holy people, a royal priesthood, a people for God's own possession.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.280]   And they were supposed to be beautiful inside and out.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:47.280]   But like this rotten waistband covered in muck and mire and river scum, they were totally ruined and worthless.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:52.280]   They were corrupt, they were polluted, and they polluted everything that they touched.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:57.280]   They soiled every good and perfect gift that had been handed down to them.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:04.280]   So in almost all of his living sermon illustrations, including this one we see in Jeremiah 13,
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:12.280]   God uses the lives of his servants to communicate a consistent and almost timeless truth.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:19.280]   Man was and is totally depraved and rotten to the core.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.280]   There is no hope in man.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.280]   There is nothing good in man.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:29.280]   Everything man touches becomes corrupted, polluted, and rotten.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   Man cannot save or redeem himself.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:40.280]   He is deserving of wrath, and he is in desperate need of saving.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:46.280]   The people on whom the flood came were described like this in Genesis 6-5.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:53.280]   Every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:37:01.280]   You and I who are sitting here today, we too have inherited this evil that plagued our forefathers.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:09.280]   So all mankind, every single person you and I know, is totally depraved and falls short of the glory of God.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:15.280]   And there is nothing good in you or me outside of Christ.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:23.280]   You and I, along with the rest of humanity, we've been created by God and for God, to love God and to serve God.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:31.280]   But we not only fail at fulfilling our God-given purpose, we are so corrupted that in our arrogant minds,
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:39.280]   we dare to believe that God exists to love and to serve us.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:49.280]   And when God, the creator of the universe, doesn't do our bidding, we believe ourselves to be justified in rejecting him.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:59.280]   And we turn to other created things that are not God's to see if they will do our bidding, to see if they will make us happy.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   The late R.C. Sproul, perhaps borrowing from the book of Jeremiah, called this posture, this arrogance, an act of cosmic treason.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:19.280]   Scripture says that the heavens are shocked and appalled at this arrogance and this rebellion.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:27.280]   In the beginning of Jeremiah's prophecy, we see that this was the core problem of the rotten and worthless people of Judah.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:35.280]   So let me read for you the Lord's own description of this problem that's found in Jeremiah 2, 12 to 13.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:45.280]   "Be appalled, O heavens, at this, and shudder and be very desolate, declares the Lord, for my people have committed two evils.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:53.280]   They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, to hew for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water."
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   So here's the context. The problem was twofold.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:05.280]   One, the people of Judah rejected their purpose by rejecting the God for whom they had been created.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:15.280]   And two, they determined in their wicked minds to find fulfillment, sustenance, and satisfaction elsewhere outside of God.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:27.280]   They had dug for themselves broken cisterns that cannot hold water, that leak all over the place, and in the end are totally useless.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:35.280]   So usage of a broken cistern to collect rainwater in the middle of the wilderness where rain was precious?
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:40.280]   Vanity. Vanity. It was all vanity.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:51.280]   So in Jeremiah 17, 5 to 11, our main text for today, we find that all of mankind is categorized into two groups.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.280]   Those who are cursed and those who are blessed.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:04.280]   This passage doesn't tell us what to do to be cursed, nor does it tell us what to do to become blessed.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:11.280]   Jeremiah 17, 5 through 11, is 100% descriptive.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:16.280]   There is nothing commanded. There is nothing prescribed.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:21.280]   There are zero suggestions in these seven verses.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.280]   So this is a descriptive passage of Scripture and not a prescriptive one.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   So this will be our outline.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   So for the remainder of our time together, I'd like for us to explore the given descriptions of cursed people and the outcome that awaits them.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:47.280]   And then I'd like for us to briefly explore what blessed people are like and quickly look at the outcome that awaits them.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:58.280]   And we'll see that God tests and searches the heart, and we will see that people are deemed either cursed or blessed depending on what God finds in their hearts.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:05.280]   And after we look at these things, we'll try and deduce an appropriate application for this descriptive passage of the Bible.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.280]   So first, let's look at what God says about the cursed man.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:19.280]   "Thus says the Lord, 'Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind and makes flesh his strength and whose heart turns away from the Lord.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:29.280]   For he will be like a bush in the desert and will not see when prosperity comes, but will live in stony waste in the wilderness, a land of salt without inhabitant.'"
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.280]   Think with me for a moment. What does "cursed" mean?
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:39.280]   What does "cursed" mean? The word in Hebrew is "arur."
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.280]   If you guys are trying to write that down, A-R-U-R, arur.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   Arur means "cursed," okay? Basically, it means "banishment from the favor of God."
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.280]   It means "exile from the goodness of God."
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:42:01.280]   It means being an object to bear, designed to bear the full brunt of the wrath of God.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   An object specifically created for the purpose of incurring wrath.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:12.280]   So I looked on Amazon yesterday for a punching bag. Not that I'm going to work out or punch.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:16.280]   I just wanted it as like a, just to see how much they cost.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:22.280]   And for a good one that's about a hundred pounds, I was shocked to see that it cost like 300 bucks.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:28.280]   You can find a $30 cheaper one, but it's about $300.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.280]   What's the purpose of a punching bag?
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.280]   To be punched, right?
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:39.280]   The $300 punching bag and the $30 punching bag have the exact same purpose.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.280]   The purpose is one and the same, to be punched.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:48.280]   That's its sole purpose, to be punched again and again and again.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.280]   Cursed!
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   Specifically appointed to be outside the favor of God,
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:03.280]   and to be hit with the unbridled wrath of God again and again and again and again.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:11.280]   In Deuteronomy 27 and 28, there are almost 66 straight verses,
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:16.280]   detailing curse after curse after curse.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.280]   Arur! Arur! Arur!
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:26.280]   If they're disobedient, Israel and her descendants would be on the outside of the grace and the favor of God.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:34.280]   And these curses would not only be physical and geographical and social political,
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:38.280]   it would also be spiritual.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   So what kinds of people deserve to be cursed by God?
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:53.280]   When we think of rapists, murderers, maybe for some of you,
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:58.280]   scammers and identity thieves, because they're more like in our life, right?
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:03.280]   There's a part of us almost hoping that they are cursed.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:07.280]   If someone scams you out of some big dollars,
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.280]   don't tell me you haven't tried to console yourself with,
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:16.280]   "Ooooh, may the Lord judge between you and me. Vengeance is mine!"
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:20.280]   says the Lord. "I want you to receive His vengeance."
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.280]   That's what's in our heart.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:29.280]   When evil folks in our society receive their due punishment, people celebrate.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:35.280]   And people lament when they think that justice is not served.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:42.280]   In the aftermath of the shootings in Texas, people were angry and rightfully so.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:47.280]   I read a few comments on some news articles detailing the event,
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:54.280]   and some people were lamenting the fact that the shooter died too quickly.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:59.280]   People, religious and even non-religious people, posted very angry things like,
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.280]   "May he rot in hell!"
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:06.280]   People who don't even believe in the existence of heaven and hell
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   so desperately want hell to exist,
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:16.280]   so that people like this active shooter or this serial killer or that rapist or that Adolf Hitler,
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.280]   so those people can be sent there,
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:23.280]   where they are incessantly and eternally judged, punished and condemned,
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:29.280]   where they are forever cursed and tormented by the wrath of God.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.280]   When we look at Jeremiah 17, 5-6 though,
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.280]   this is pointing to the unbridled wrath of God.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.280]   It's not only for the most hardened criminals,
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:45.280]   it's just as much reserved for those who trust in mankind.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.280]   Those who make flesh their strength.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:51.280]   Those whose hearts turn away from the Lord.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:56.280]   So the baseline, the starting point of being a recipient of the wrath of God,
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:04.280]   this curse, "Arur", it's trusting in man.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   In context, the people in Jeremiah's day were facing very real threats to their society and to their safety.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.280]   They were in a time of war.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:19.280]   There were real threats to their way of life and to their children's futures.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.280]   Assyria had wiped out the northern kingdom of Israel,
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:27.280]   and Babylon, a more wicked and terrifying empire, came and wiped out Assyria,
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:32.280]   and now they were turning their attention toward the people of Judah.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:37.280]   And the people of Judah were terrified of them.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:44.280]   Some in Judah advised, "Hey, let's turn to Egypt for military assistance."
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:50.280]   Some entertained reaching out to Babylon to see if they could curry some kind of favor
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:55.280]   or to work out some kind of agreement and be slaves.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.280]   Bottom line, they wanted to survive.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:02.280]   They needed to ensure a brighter future for their children,
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:06.280]   and they reasoned that compromises needed to be made.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   And some believed, because they didn't like King Zedekiah,
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:14.280]   some believed that having the right king on the throne was the answer,
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.280]   so they trusted in man.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:22.280]   The very reason Israel had a human king to begin with
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   was because they didn't believe that having God as king wasn't anywhere near enough.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.280]   You guys remember that?
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.280]   They had always walked by side and not by faith.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:38.280]   So let's review together briefly how Saul, Israel's first king, came to power,
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.280]   1 Samuel 8, 19 to 20.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:45.280]   Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and they said,
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   "No, but there shall be a king over us,
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.280]   that we also may be like all the other nations,
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:59.280]   that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles."
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:07.280]   So what we can deduce and learn from what we see here in Jeremiah 17, 5 to 6,
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:14.280]   cursed men trust in men.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:21.280]   Cursed men put their hope in sin-tainted flesh.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   Cursed men do not believe God, the creator of the universe, to be enough.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:32.280]   Cursed men put their hope in national and global leaders.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:38.280]   Now to be sure, in Scripture, all men are called to submit to the God-ordained human institutions
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   and to pray for the salvation of their leaders and to pray for wisdom,
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:50.280]   but man is never instructed to ever put hope in sin-tainted man.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:57.280]   Cursed men put their hope in religious institutions.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:03.280]   Cursed men trust wholly in the findings of science.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:08.280]   Many cursed men pride themselves on being self-sufficient.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.280]   Cursed men trust in degrees and status.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:18.280]   Cursed men trust in their own efforts, their intellect, their skills, and their abilities.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:24.280]   Cursed men trust their determination and will.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:29.280]   Cursed men often work hard in their religious practices.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   Cursed men trust their gut, their heart, their instincts.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.280]   Cursed men trust in the wealth that they've stored up for themselves.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:53.280]   Cursed men believe that a change of circumstance will make me happier.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:59.280]   Cursed men believe that if they only had had the right parents,
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:09.280]   if only they find the right spouse, land the right job, meet the right friends, they will be happy.
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:14.280]   Cursed men believe that happiness can be found outside of God.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:22.280]   And cursed men mistakenly believe that God is against them being happy.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:25.280]   So let me read Jeremiah 17, 5-6 for you again.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   Thus says the Lord, "Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:34.280]   and makes flesh his strength and whose heart turns away from the Lord,
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:38.280]   for he will be like a bush in the desert and will not see when prosperity comes,
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:43.280]   but will live in stony wastes in the wilderness, a land of salt without inhabitant."
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:47.280]   So what is this cursed man's lot in life?
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:53.280]   His life is desolate. His life is meaningless.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:58.280]   His life will amount to nothing for all eternity.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.280]   He will be like a land of salt.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.280]   There are a number of texts from ancient Mesopotamia
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:11.280]   that describe a progressive salinity in southern part of Iraq.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.280]   And the land was unable to be used for agriculture
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:21.280]   and was at one point abandoned for 240 years. Desolate.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.280]   He will be like a bush in the desert.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:28.280]   Dried bushes and branches, the Legacy Standard Bible calls it the juniper.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.280]   I didn't even know what it looked like, so I actually had to Google it.
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:37.280]   The bush, the branch, the juniper.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:42.280]   They are all functionally useless things in the desert.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.280]   The only thing that finds them useful?
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.280]   Wildfires.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.280]   They are indeed like chaff that the wind blows away,
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.280]   and they are by nature objects of wrath, cursed.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:03.280]   So in verses 5 and 6, we see the description of the cursed man's choices
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:10.280]   and a description of the cursed man's end, what he will be like.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.280]   But let's now turn our attention to the Lord's description of the blessed man.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.280]   The blessed man, verses 7 and 8.
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:23.280]   Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, and whose trust is the Lord.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:28.280]   For he will be like a tree planted by the water that extends its roots by a stream
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.280]   and will not fear when the heat comes.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.280]   But its leaves will be green, and it will not be anxious in a year of drought,
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:38.280]   nor cease to yield fruit.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.280]   I'm sure some of you are thinking this reads kind of like Psalm 1.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:48.280]   This blessed man, unlike the cursed man, he trusts in the Lord.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.280]   His trust is the Lord.
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:59.280]   He not only chooses the Lord as his refuge, he sees the Lord as his very source of life.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:04.280]   The Lord is the purpose of his very existence.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:10.280]   He submits to the truth that he has been created by God and for God,
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.280]   to love God and to serve God.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.280]   So what does this man's life look like?
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:22.280]   When the heat and the fiery trials of life come,
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:29.280]   he doesn't wilt, he doesn't cower, he doesn't fear.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:34.280]   He doesn't dry up when circumstances grow bleak.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:41.280]   No, he remains joy-filled, healthy, and full of Zoel life.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:46.280]   And even in extended seasons of hardship, he is not anxious.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:57.280]   He is always bearing fruit, and he is rewarded because of this fruit, the blessed man.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:03.280]   Now, how does God determine who is cursed and who is blessed?
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.280]   We know that God does not look at the same thing man looks at.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:14.280]   Verses 9 and 10 tell us the criterion by which God deems somebody cursed or somebody blessed.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.280]   Jeremiah 17, 9.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:22.280]   The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.280]   Who can understand it?
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:27.280]   I, the Lord, search the heart.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:32.280]   I test the mind, even to give each man according to his ways, according to the results of his deeds.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.280]   This is a verse that might be familiar with many of you.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:42.280]   These two verses inform us that the Lord searches the heart.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.280]   He tests the mind.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.280]   The mind here is not referring to intellect.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:52.280]   So this is not like an academic exercise to try to figure out what you know.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:55.280]   It's referring to a person's core volitions.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:59.280]   It's literally in Hebrew, the kidneys.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.280]   But because it would be contextually difficult for us to understand,
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:09.280]   I, the Lord, test the kidneys, modern translations have rendered it as mind.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.280]   Okay?
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:17.280]   The LSB calls it the inmost being.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:21.280]   God isn't looking at the outward performance of man,
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:31.280]   but he's looking at the heart of the man, his very core, his inmost being, right now.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:44.280]   He's not looking at whether you're seated here on a chair in the church or in the courtyard.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:52.280]   He did not judge you by whether you've worshipped with your hands raised and with your praise face on.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:56:00.280]   He's looking at whether you're worshipping in spirit and in truth from the very depth of your inmost being.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.280]   The Lord looks at your heart.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:06.280]   There is nothing hidden.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.280]   Scary thought.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:13.280]   Jesus in Matthew 15 talks about the heart.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:20.280]   The Lord Jesus teaches his disciples through a parable that man is not defiled by eating unclean things
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.280]   or by eating with unwashed hands.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:30.280]   The sin-tainted and sin-defiled heart brings forth every form of wickedness that you and I see.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:35.280]   So he basically teaches that a man is not a sinner because he sins,
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:40.280]   but man sins because he is a sinner because he's rotten to the very core.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:43.280]   So Matthew 15, 18 to 20.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:49.280]   But the things that proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and those defile the man.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:56.280]   For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnesses, slanders.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:59.280]   These are the things which defile the man.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:05.280]   But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:11.280]   So man's problems are not in his behavior, but in his heart.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:22.280]   That is why modifying your behavior and trying a little harder to make changes in your life cannot save you.
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:28.280]   Not getting all the religious rituals right isn't what defiles you.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:32.280]   Murder, theft, fornications, lies.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:35.280]   These are all symptoms.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:41.280]   The virus, the root problem, is in your heart.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:47.280]   Jeremiah 17, 9 describes the heart as more deceitful than anything else.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.280]   It is desperately sick.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.280]   The NIV calls it beyond cure.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.280]   It's beyond help.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   NyQuil does not cure the cold or the flu.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.280]   Not just if you knew that already.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.280]   Okay, if you didn't, well, you learned something new today.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:16.280]   NyQuil only masks your symptoms to give you some relief and some comfort so you can go about your day.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:20.280]   NyQuil is a symptomatic medicine.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.280]   It masks.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.280]   It doesn't heal.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:35.280]   In the same way, no matter how good your religious activity, no matter how moral or upright your act,
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:43.280]   no matter how good you may feel about your Bible reading plan or how much money you've given to the poor,
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:49.280]   your disease runs super deep.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:55.280]   We can deceive our neighbor to make him think more highly of us than he ought.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:59:05.280]   We can deceive ourselves so that we look at others as beneath us, less mature, less sanctified than us,
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:13.280]   less knowledgeable than us, as less deserving of grace than us.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:23.280]   But unfortunately for you and me, holy, holy, holy God looks at your heart,
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:34.280]   sees the sin there which he cannot tolerate, and is absolutely justified in condemning and cursing you.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.280]   Arur.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:42.280]   Again and again and again.
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:50.280]   A weeping Jeremiah proclaimed this for decades, and he was hated.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:56.280]   He will proclaim, "There is no peace. There is no peace. Don't listen to them.
[00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:02.280]   Turn. Repent. Don't trust Pharaoh for help.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:06.280]   Pharaoh cannot help you. Don't turn a Nebuchadnezzar.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:13.280]   God's using Babylon to discipline us, to warn us. What are you doing?
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:19.280]   Did he not say that if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray,
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.280]   turn from their wicked ways and seek my face, then I will hear from heaven,
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:32.280]   will forgive their sin, and then heal their land. We need to turn."
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:37.280]   We read the response of King Zedekiah and his officials in Jeremiah 37.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:43.280]   Then the officials were angry at Jeremiah, and they beat him.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:52.280]   They put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe, which they had made into the prison.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:01:00.280]   For Jeremiah had come into the dungeon, that is, the vaulted cells, and Jeremiah stayed there many days.
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:05.280]   If it were not for the grace of God, there is not a single one of us
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:12.280]   who would not respond in anger like this to this message.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:20.280]   Our hearts are so filled with arrogance that we cannot but be offended.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:25.280]   This message is foolishness to those who are perishing.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:31.280]   But the offensive truth is this, not a single one of us,
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:38.280]   when our hearts have been thoroughly searched, would ever qualify for the blessing of God.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.280]   There would not be a single person in the blessed category.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:50.280]   Every person who has ever lived would rightfully qualify for cursed.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.280]   Does that make sense to you?
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:58.280]   Unfortunately, you and I serve a kind God,
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:05.280]   and it is His kindness that leads us to repentance, Romans 2.4.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:11.280]   Jeremiah is shown a vision of kindness in his dream.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:17.280]   He is told in a dream that a cure would be made available for this incurable, desperate heart of man.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:22.280]   He says, "At this I awoke, and I looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me."
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.280]   And you see a very exalted Jeremiah.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:31.280]   Both the prophet Ezekiel and Jeremiah had a great vision of hope.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.280]   God will make a new covenant with the house of Israel.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.280]   His new covenant will not be like the first one, which He commanded the people to keep,
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.280]   which He wrote down on two tablets of stone, Deuteronomy 4.13.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:50.280]   He will write this new covenant on their very hearts.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:55.280]   In fact, He will do the impossible and unthinkable.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.280]   He will do a complete transplant of the heart itself,
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:07.280]   and not just with the people of Israel, but to all who would trust in the Lord.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:12.280]   And He will make those who fit the cursed category to a T,
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:17.280]   declare them blessed.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.280]   Ezekiel 36, 24-28, "For I will take you from the nations,
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:27.280]   gather you from all the lands, and bring you into your own land.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.280]   Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:34.280]   And I will cleanse you from all your filthiness, from all your idols.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:40.280]   Moreover, I will give you a new heart, and put a new spirit within you.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:46.280]   And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh, and give you a heart of flesh.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:52.280]   I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:55.280]   And you will be careful to observe my ordinances.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.280]   You will live in the land that I gave to your forefathers,
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:05.280]   and you will be my people, and I will be your God."
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.280]   The Lord searches the heart.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.280]   He tests the kidneys,
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.280]   even to give to each man according to his ways, according to the results of his deeds.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:26.280]   And now, because He will make available a spiritual heart transplant,
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:33.280]   through the cross of Christ, those who once were cursed can now be called blessed.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.280]   The old has gone, the new has come.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:43.280]   The righteousness of Christ is imputed to all believers through faith.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:46.280]   And on the basis of Christ's righteousness,
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:51.280]   the Lord who searches the heart, who tests the inmost being,
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.280]   now rewards the believer according to Christ's ways,
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.280]   according to the results of Christ's deeds.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:06.280]   And if you believe this, you who once were cursed are now blessed of God.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:10.280]   This is the gospel of Jesus Christ. Amen?
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.280]   That's the gospel.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:17.280]   Galatians 3, 13-14.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.280]   Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law,
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:24.280]   having become a curse for us, for it is written,
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.280]   "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,"
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:31.280]   in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles,
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:38.280]   so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:41.280]   So like I mentioned toward the beginning of the sermon,
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:49.280]   Jeremiah 17, 5-11 is 100% descriptive.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:59.280]   The entire passage is detailing both the characteristics and the fate of the cursed people and blessed people.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:06.280]   There is nothing commanded or suggested in Jeremiah 17.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:17.280]   But allow me to draw out some conclusions and appropriate prescriptions for this descriptive passage.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:23.280]   I expect that there are people sitting in this room and in the courtyard and at home
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:28.280]   who still remain cursed of God,
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:34.280]   still destined to bear the unbridled wrath of God.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:38.280]   And this group of those cursed of God,
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:46.280]   there are two groups of you, I believe, listening to this sermon.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:52.280]   There are those who totally will acknowledge, "I am not a believer.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.280]   I don't have faith in Christ."
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:58.280]   So perhaps you can't believe God exists,
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:04.280]   and even if He did, you're not quite willing or ready to trust Him.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.280]   That's the first group.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:11.280]   My charge to you is this.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:17.280]   There is no other way.
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:23.280]   You cannot save you.
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:27.280]   You don't have to clean up your act before you come to Him.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:32.280]   You just need to acknowledge your desperate condition,
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:38.280]   confess your sins, repent of your ways, and surrender.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:41.280]   And I assure you with all my heart,
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:46.280]   with all my heart, one sin's tainted, now redeemed, okay?
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.280]   Not trustworthy.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:51.280]   But I assure you, with all my heart,
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.280]   there is no other way.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:58.280]   For there is no other name under heaven given to man
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.280]   by which we must be saved, Acts 4:12.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.280]   None.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.280]   Acts 17:11, some of you guys are thinking,
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.280]   "Hey, he's going to skip the partridge passage."
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.280]   No, I'm not.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.280]   We're going to talk about that, all right?
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:16.280]   Acts 17:11, allow me to briefly explain to you the final verse in this passage.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.280]   "As a partridge that hatches eggs which is not laid,
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:23.280]   so is he who makes a fortune but unjustly.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.280]   In the midst of his days it will forsake him,
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.280]   and in the end he will be a fool."
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:31.280]   The LSB adds the word "wicked," "wicked fool."
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:37.280]   So the partridge here takes credit for being the parent
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:41.280]   of these non-partridge random birds.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.280]   You guys with me?
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:49.280]   This partridge had no real role in the creation of
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.280]   or the hatching of the eggs.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.280]   But it seems that this partridge is deceived into thinking
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.280]   that it deserves the credit.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:04.280]   It sees the life and successful growth
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:09.280]   and attributes that growth to itself.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:14.280]   The partridge represents a wicked fool, according to verse 11,
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:17.280]   who has prospered.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:22.280]   In life on this side of heaven, we often see the wicked prosper.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:28.280]   Evil men may become rich and live without any real care or hardship in the world.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:33.280]   And they won't ever see any real need for God.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:36.280]   They don't believe in God.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:40.280]   The purpose of their lives is to enjoy their lives.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:42.280]   They deserve it.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:45.280]   They've worked hard.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:49.280]   So this fool, as he is called in Jeremiah 17, 11,
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:57.280]   because of his comfort, he takes credit for the fruit and for the success.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.280]   That leads him to arrogance.
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:06.280]   But in the midst of priding himself over these accomplishments,
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:09.280]   he will suddenly perish.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:12.280]   The fool says in his heart, Psalm 14, what?
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.280]   There is no God.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.280]   There is no curse.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:24.280]   Arur, what nonsense is that?
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:35.280]   He dies and realizes too late and for all eternity that he was wrong.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:41.280]   So for you in the first group, literally believe it or not,
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:49.280]   there is no other way.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:52.280]   None.
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:57.280]   The second category of you that may still remain cursed here today
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:04.280]   is a bit more troubling and dangerous.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:07.280]   You will say all the right things.
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.280]   You will profess all the right things.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:15.280]   You will sign up for and be involved in all the right things.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:21.280]   But in your hearts, you are deceiving and being deceived.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:27.280]   You are perhaps an evil man or an imposter going from bad to worse,
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.280]   as it says in 2 Timothy 3, 13.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:40.280]   Your trust is not in Yahweh but in man, perhaps in yourself,
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:45.280]   perhaps in the nice people around you, perhaps in the cool church that you go to,
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:54.280]   perhaps in changes of laws and policies, perhaps in change of circumstance.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:12:06.280]   You may even be an active member here at the church and be cursed.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:11.280]   As Christian leaders, as pastors and elders at the church,
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:16.280]   we do not have the ability to perfectly judge your heart,
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:21.280]   nor do we have the authority to do that.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:26.280]   It can only go by your confession, your profession,
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:30.280]   and to varying degrees, your outward conformity.
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:36.280]   We cannot see your heart.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.280]   Sometimes because, as it says in Luke 6, 45,
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.280]   out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks,
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:43.280]   we get little insights and glimpses into your heart,
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.280]   but we cannot see your heart.
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:51.280]   So I'm pretty sure we've let those cursed into our membership,
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.280]   not because we're not trying to be careful and discerning,
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:13:01.280]   but because we have no insight into the heart of man.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:09.280]   We cannot determine for you accurately, fully,
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:14.280]   if your heart still remains one of stone.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:20.280]   But God sees it, and He judges it.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.280]   So the invitation for you who look blessed,
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:33.280]   yet still remain cursed, would be the same.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:38.280]   Receive this free gift of God and submit fully to the Lordship of Christ
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.280]   while you still can.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.280]   Seek the Lord while He may be found.
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.280]   Now, for those of you who are blessed of God,
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:56.280]   there are three exhortations I'll leave you with loosely from Ephesians 2, 8-10.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:01.280]   That's a challenge when the Scripture doesn't have a prescription.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:04.280]   Okay, so I will leave one loosely for you.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:08.280]   Ephesians 2, 8-10, "For by grace you have been saved through faith,
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.280]   and that not of yourselves.
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:13.280]   It is the gift of God, not as a result of works,
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.280]   so that no one may boast.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:19.280]   For we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.280]   which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:26.280]   It's a very familiar passage.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.280]   "For by grace you have been saved."
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:32.280]   So for the first application,
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:37.280]   it's remember that you have been saved but are still being saved.
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.280]   You who have been saved must continue to work out this salvation
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:44.280]   with fear and trembling.
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.280]   Regularly examine your hearts.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:52.280]   Regularly consider who it is you are trusting.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:15:00.280]   The residual effects of the cursed man remains a part of all of us.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:03.280]   It will continue to be a part of us,
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:07.280]   on this side of glory.
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.280]   So continue not to trust in yourself.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.280]   Continue not to trust in man.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:19.280]   Continue to grow in not putting any confidence in flesh.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.280]   We need to be sanctified of this.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.280]   We need to proactively grow in this.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.280]   If you feel your heart drifting away from the Lord,
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.280]   be proactive.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.280]   If you feel your heart drifting away from the Lord,
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:41.280]   be proactive in trying to right the ship as soon as you can.
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.280]   And as blessed people,
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:50.280]   let us long together for the return of Christ.
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.280]   For when that happens,
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:58.280]   even all the residual effects of this old cursed man
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:01.280]   will be gone forever. Hallelujah.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:07.280]   Second, Ephesians 2 says,
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.280]   "So that no one can boast."
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:14.280]   So lest you think, "Oh, man cannot be trusted.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.280]   I can do whatever I want.
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.280]   I can't trust any hierarchy, any structure."
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.280]   Be careful. That's not the appropriate application.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:25.280]   So be humble.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.280]   Be subject to your leaders and to be subject to one another.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:34.280]   We aren't called to trust man or put our hope in man.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:38.280]   But we are called to subject ourselves to one another
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:41.280]   out of reverence for Christ.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.280]   We are called to be subject to our spiritual leaders,
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:48.280]   all of whom are not perfect.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.280]   Even the spiritual giants of our day.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.280]   I was actually thinking through,
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:54.280]   if I could spend a month with somebody,
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.280]   like some spiritual giant, who would it be?
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:59.280]   And I had a list of a few.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.280]   But I am pretty sure that if I spend a month with that person,
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:07.280]   I'm going to start seeing them less godly than I do now.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:11.280]   From a distance, everyone looks holy.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:15.280]   From a distance, everyone looks clean.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.280]   But even the spiritual giants of our day,
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.280]   if you get to know them, you'll see their sins,
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.280]   their spots, and their blemishes.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:23.280]   And you will for sure think less of every single person
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.280]   the closer you get to them.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:28.280]   Remember, the best of men, even the best of men,
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.280]   are men at best.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:36.280]   So in trusting the Lord, subject yourself to the human leaders
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:45.280]   and the human members of the body of Christ.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.280]   Even with the best of men in our lives,
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.280]   if you see Christ in them,
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:54.280]   be subject to them, honor them, and pray.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:57.280]   Your hope is not in these men.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.280]   No man is worthy of your trust or allegiance.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.280]   So don't be shocked.
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:07.280]   Don't be super disappointed or crushed when they fail you.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.280]   Also, be humble before one another.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:12.280]   Be humble before those more spiritually mature than you.
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.280]   Be humble before those less spiritually mature than you.
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:18.280]   Be humble toward those who are very different from you.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.280]   And remember that salvation is not a result of your works.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:25.280]   It's a gift of God.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:30.280]   Do not trust man, but humbly love and serve man
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.280]   in the ways Christ loved you and served you.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.280]   Amen?
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:40.280]   Third and lastly, it says, "We are his workmanship."
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:47.280]   So because you and I, if we're blessed, we're his bride,
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.280]   and because he is a faithful bridegroom,
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.280]   he will purify you, he will sanctify you.
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.280]   Ephesians 5, 26-27,
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.280]   "So that he might sanctify her,
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.280]   having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:05.280]   so that he might present to himself the church in all her glory,
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.280]   having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing,
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:10.280]   but she would be holy and blameless."
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:14.280]   So Jesus purifies his bride through the washing with the word.
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.280]   So do not resist this washing.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.280]   Pursue the proper knowledge of the word of God,
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.280]   because it says in Hebrews 4, 12,
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.280]   "It's the word of God that's living and active,
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.280]   sharper than any double-edged sword."
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:30.280]   That's going to test the thoughts and the attitudes of your heart
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:32.280]   and squeeze you and sanctify you.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:34.280]   So sit before the word of God,
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:37.280]   no matter how uncomfortable it may feel.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.280]   Get a steady intake of his word.
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.280]   And by his word, I don't mean Christian books
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:44.280]   or Christian commentaries.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.280]   People love Christian books and Christian commentaries,
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.280]   and there's nothing wrong with them.
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:56.280]   But they're written by sin-tainted, corrupted men as well.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:00.280]   So your final authority has to be the Scriptures,
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:03.280]   not in what some man says about the Scriptures.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:09.280]   If you catch yourself quoting men
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.280]   more than you are quoting Scripture,
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:16.280]   you're not growing in biblical literacy.
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:19.280]   You're possibly growing in arrogance.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:26.280]   As you get to know the Lord through his word,
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:31.280]   you will grow in humility, terror, and love.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:37.280]   If you focus all your mind on just books about the Bible,
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:40.280]   you will only get poofed in the head.
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:42.280]   So get to know the word of God.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:45.280]   Grow in your understanding of the Bible,
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.280]   not just in your understanding about the Bible.
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:52.280]   Grow in biblical literacy so you can know him better
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.280]   and make him known.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.280]   Obsess over his word.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.280]   Meditate on his word.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.280]   Memorize his word.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.280]   Why?
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.280]   If you don't memorize, how are you going to meditate day and night
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.280]   like the blessed man?
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:07.280]   And grow in applying his word to every aspect of your life.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:11.280]   And after all, remember that we are his workmanship
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:14.280]   created in Christ Jesus for good works.
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:18.280]   You were created by God and for God to love God
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.280]   and to serve God.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:26.280]   So be blessed so you can move others to be blessed
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.280]   and you can be used by the Lord
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:32.280]   to bring others from cursed to blessed.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.280]   I'm going to close with Psalm 1,
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:37.280]   which reads a lot like our Jeremiah passage.
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:42.280]   How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.280]   nor stand in the way of sinners,
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.280]   nor sit in the seat of scoffers.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:50.280]   But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:55.280]   and in his law he meditates day and night.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:00.280]   He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water,
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.280]   which yields its fruit in its season,
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.280]   and its leaf does not wither.
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:10.280]   And in whatever he does, he prospers.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:11.280]   So let's pray.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:24.280]   Lord, would you have your way in us?
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:28.280]   Would your word bear fruit in us?
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:37.280]   And simply grow us to be more and more like your Son?
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:41.280]   We're going to walk out of here,
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.280]   possibly forget a lot of what we heard.
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:50.280]   But by your Spirit, would you etch indelibly into the fabric of our hearts
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.280]   your word of truth.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:58.280]   We entrust this day and our hearts into your care.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.280]   For in you alone is our hope.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.280]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.280]   Let's all stand together as we sing this closing praise.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:17.280]   [piano music]
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.280]   Oh Lord.
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:22.280]   Oh Lord.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:25.280]   Could save themselves.
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:30.280]   Their own soul could heal.
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:38.280]   Our shame was deeper than the sea.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:42.280]   Your grace is deeper still.
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:43.280]   One more time.
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.280]   Oh Lord.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.280]   Could save themselves.
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:56.280]   Their own soul could heal.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:03.280]   Our shame was deeper than the sea.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.280]   Your grace is deeper still.
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.280]   You alone.
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:11.280]   You alone can rescue.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:14.280]   You alone can save.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:20.280]   You alone can lift us from the grave.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:24.280]   You came down to find us.
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:27.280]   Let us out of death.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:33.280]   To you alone belongs the highest praise.
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:44.280]   You, oh Lord, have made a way.
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:49.280]   The great divide you've revealed.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:57.280]   For when our hearts were far away,
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:00.280]   your love went further.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.280]   Yes, your love, Lord.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.280]   Yes, your love goes further still.
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:12.280]   You alone can rescue.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:15.280]   You alone can save.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:21.280]   You alone can lift us from the grave.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.280]   You came down to find us.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:27.280]   Let us out of death.
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:34.280]   To you alone belongs the highest praise.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:38.280]   We lift up.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:40.280]   We lift up our eyes.
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.280]   Lift up our eyes.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.280]   You're the giver of life.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.280]   We lift up our eyes.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:47.280]   Lift up our eyes.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.280]   You're the giver of life.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.280]   We lift up our eyes.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.280]   Lift up our eyes.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.280]   You're the giver of life.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.280]   We lift up our eyes.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.280]   Lift up our eyes.
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.280]   You're the giver of life.
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:08.280]   You alone can rescue.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.280]   You alone can save.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:18.280]   You alone can lift us from the grave.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.280]   You came down to find us.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.280]   Let us out of death.
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:31.280]   To you alone belongs the highest praise.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.280]   You alone can rescue.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.280]   You alone can save.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:43.280]   You alone can lift us from the grave.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:46.280]   You came down to find us.
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:49.280]   Let us out of death.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:56.280]   To you alone belongs the highest praise.
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:02.280]   To you alone belongs the highest praise.
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:07.280]   You alone belongs the highest praise.
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.280]   Join with me in the closing prayer and benediction.
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:23.280]   Now may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.280]   and love of God the Father,
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.280]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:33.280]   empower, strengthen, and rejuvenate
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:38.280]   every soul in here that has been moved from cursed to blessed,
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.280]   now and forever.
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.280]   Amen.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.280]   [MUSIC - "GOD SENT HIS SON"]
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:46.280]   God sent his son.
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:51.280]   They called him Jesus.
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:59.280]   He came to love, heal, and forgive.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:05.280]   He lived and died.
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:19.280]   To buy my pardon, an empty grave is there to prove
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:24.280]   my Savior lives.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:32.280]   Because he lives, I confess tomorrow.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:43.280]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:54.280]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:07.280]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
