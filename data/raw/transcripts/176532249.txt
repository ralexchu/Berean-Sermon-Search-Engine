[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   If you can turn your Bibles this morning to Romans chapter 8 and I'm going to be reading
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.280]   verse 18 through 21.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.560]   Romans chapter 8, 18 through 21.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.920]   And our focus mainly is going to be on verse 20 and 21.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.200]   "Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.560]   to justification and life for all men.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.000]   For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by one man's obedience
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.440]   the many will be made righteous.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.640]   Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.640]   the more.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.240]   So that as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness, leading
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.160]   to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.600]   You know, a few years ago when I was out in China I met a bunch of adoptees, Korean adoptees
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.000]   who were adopted when they were young and then they were brought to the United States.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.520]   And some of them were not even aware that they were adopted and then they find out later
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.520]   on in life.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.280]   And I've actually known a few people where that happened.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.760]   And obviously you can imagine how much it will change their paradigm and how they look
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.960]   upon life and re-remember everything that they remembered or childhood.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.000]   Every once in a while something may happen in your life that causes you to see everything
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.200]   differently.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.640]   It might be something good, it might be something tragic, but it changes your paradigm.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.040]   And obviously every single Christian, whether it happened gradually, it happened all of
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.160]   a sudden, it causes us to look at everything differently.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.480]   Paul has been talking to a group of Jews where keeping the law was everything.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.320]   They were seeking shalom from God.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.480]   To seek shalom basically meant that God would bless their life.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.320]   And they thought that the shalom from God would come if they obeyed the law of God.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.680]   So the law to them was not simply obeying and not obeying.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.560]   The obedience to the law for the Jews meant financial security.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.640]   Obeying the law meant that that's their way of being healthy, to get ahead in life.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.160]   And obeying the law is what caused them to have many children and to be fruitful and
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.680]   to have generational blessings.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.640]   So imagine if that was your paradigm and all of a sudden, Apostle Paul begins to tell them
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.160]   that absolutely, that absolutely adds nothing to your salvation.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.800]   In fact, not only does that not add to your salvation, he says through the law, all you
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   have is condemnation.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.720]   That's what Paul says up to this point.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.680]   He's saying those who have the law are condemned without the law.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.280]   Those who have the law will be condemned because of the law.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.640]   That it was not your path of salvation, that you're not going to be blessed, you're not
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.560]   going to be healthy, you're not going to be multiple generations of the Lord's blessing
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.080]   as a result of it.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.600]   Instead, all it brought was condemnation.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.560]   So imagine how difficult this must have been for the Jews to accept.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.000]   The more committed you were to the law, the more resistant you were to the gospel.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.880]   Even after the resurrection of Christ, even people who met Christ in his resurrection
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.880]   had a difficult time.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.880]   They were the Judaizers.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.080]   They said, you know what, we can't deny the fact that Jesus was resurrected, but they
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.440]   still couldn't let go of their past.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.520]   They couldn't let go of the law.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.040]   So they tried to incorporate some of the law into the new covenant.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.520]   We can imagine how difficult it must have been for the Jews to accept the pure gospel.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.000]   And that's why over and over again, Paul and the other authors of the New Testament is
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.200]   arguing this point.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.400]   That it is not through the law, but by the grace of God.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.760]   Paul says something very provocative in this passage in verse 20 where he says, not only
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.960]   is the law not a way of salvation for you, he says the law came to increase trespass.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.480]   To increase trespass.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.040]   Meaning that when God gave you the law, not only did it not save you, it actually caused
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.080]   you to sin even more.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.520]   So the natural question that we would ask if we read that, and if we misread that, maybe,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.760]   wait a minute, does that mean that God is the author of sin?
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.200]   Because clearly God gave us the law.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.160]   And if Paul is saying God gave us the law and law caused us to sin more, then could
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.200]   we say the logical response to that is that God is the author of sin?
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   Of course not.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   By no means.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.880]   You have to understand the context in which Paul is saying.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.880]   Paul is using the language basically to provoke the Jews to pay attention.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:51.400]   Because what he's about to say, he needs to have them, again, to take a minute to reflect
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.440]   and to look upon what he's about to say.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.440]   So he's provoking them.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.240]   He's deliberately using that language, which would get their attention.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.360]   But along with that, what Paul says here about the law is not comprehensive.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.040]   He says many other things about the law in other parts of his letters.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.600]   In fact, in other parts where he actually says the law is good.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.080]   Other parts of the letter where he says that there is a law of Christ that we ought to
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.080]   obey.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.880]   So what he's saying here is not necessarily comprehensive, but in the context of justification,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:30.360]   in the context of salvation, the law actually does not cause us to be justified.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.160]   There's three things that I want to look at in verse 20 and 21 that he says that the law
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.000]   was given for.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.360]   So these three things.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.800]   So number one, he said that the law was given to increase trespass.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.200]   To increase trespass.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.040]   As crazy as that may sound, I think in reality, you and I would all agree.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:59.000]   I remember years ago, at the very beginning of the church, when I think those who are
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.520]   in their mid-30s now, at that time was probably 18 or 19.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.560]   And at the very beginning of the church, every Friday night, we went through the book of
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.560]   Romans.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.720]   So some of you, a few of you may remember that.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   Most of you were not there.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.600]   But while we were going through Romans, one of the assignments that I gave on Friday night
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.600]   was that I wanted them to create their own gospel tract through the book of Romans.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.160]   So use the Roman road that we see, the gospel presentation, the book of Romans, and create
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.740]   a gospel tract.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.840]   So different people, they were put into groups of maybe about three, and then they got gathered
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.200]   together and wrote the gospel tract out.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.520]   And then they actually made the gospel tract, and then they turned it in.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.640]   But I remember this one particular one that Pastor Aaron did that really stood out, that
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.400]   caused me to think, "Oh, that's clever."
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.720]   And what he did was, on the cover of that, and some of you guys, a few of you guys may
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.280]   remember, he says that it says nothing, right?
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.680]   There's no Bible verse, there's nothing.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.160]   All it says is, "Do not open."
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.160]   Right?
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.520]   "Do not open."
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.080]   So I remember looking at that, I said, "What kind of a gospel tract is this?"
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.080]   Like, "Do not open."
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.480]   I remember the what's in here.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.200]   So obviously, you open it.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:16.080]   And as soon as you open it, he's like, "You sinner."
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.560]   That was the beginning of the gospel tract.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.600]   I remember thinking, "That's clever."
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.200]   All of sin and falsehood are the glory of God.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.360]   The reason why you open it is because there's a rebellion in our hearts that goes against
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.400]   what's right, and he started going off on the gospel.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.960]   Again, I remember that stuck in my mind because I thought that was a clever way to begin the
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.280]   presentation of the gospel.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:46.080]   When Paul says that the law came, and when the law came, it provoked us to sin further.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:52.880]   But again, it's not that the sin wasn't already in our hearts, but it provoked it.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.120]   Meaning that when the law came, it revealed what was already dormant in our hearts.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:04.680]   And when the law said to do this and do that, it provoked us to rebellion.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:11.520]   The law was never meant, it was never an avenue for us to be saved.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.120]   Think about it from God's perspective.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.160]   God gave Adam and Eve one law, and they couldn't obey that one law.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.000]   And because of that one law, condemnation came into all man.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.440]   So think how ridiculous it would be where God thinks, "Okay, they can obey this one
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.640]   law, but maybe they can obey the hundreds of laws.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.760]   Maybe if they kept all the laws, that they can somehow save themselves."
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.320]   Imagine how ridiculous that logic would be, knowing that they couldn't even obey one law,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.960]   to think that somehow if you obeyed all the laws, that you can somehow be saved.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.200]   The law was never brought to us for the purpose of salvation.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:55.960]   In Hebrews 4.12, it says, "The law judges the thoughts and intentions of our heart."
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.120]   When the Word of God is open, it judges us.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.240]   It convicts us that this is who we are, this is what's happening.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.120]   But it doesn't say that the law restores us.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.520]   It doesn't say that the law revives us or saves us.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.680]   It just convicts us.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.960]   In Jeremiah 17.10, it says, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.960]   sick.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.360]   Who can understand it?"
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.240]   Now, you're coming to a Bible-teaching church where we have a high view of the Word of God
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.840]   and a high view of theology in our church.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.120]   And so when you come to a Bible-teaching church, our natural tendency is to read that and say,
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.200]   "You know, that's right, those charismatics, those who give all their attention to their
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.640]   emotions, but we're about the intellect.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.720]   And as long as we don't give in to emotionalism, somehow we are safe."
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.200]   Well in the time of the Old Testament and the New Testament, the word "heart" was
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.840]   not used the way that you and I use it in this modern era.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.560]   Usually when we talk about heart, we're talking about somebody's emotion.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:03.760]   In the New Testament, when they were referring to specifically emotion, they would say "bowels."
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.920]   Their bowels would be moved in some way.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.280]   When the New Testament, again the biblical language, when they used the word "heart,"
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.120]   it's similar to the way that we would say "soul."
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:23.120]   All of us, every part of us, including our emotion, our will, and our intellect, all
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.640]   of that is encompassed in this word "heart."
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.540]   At least that's the way they used it.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.320]   So for us to understand Jeremiah 17.10, it means, the way we ought to understand it,
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:39.640]   is that not simply to not trust your emotions, but don't trust yourself, period.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.760]   Even your intellect.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.960]   It wasn't just our emotion that got corrupted, even our intellect got corrupted.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.540]   We can easily rationalize bad theology.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.480]   We can easily use the Scriptures to harm people.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.160]   It is not just emotion, but all of it.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.080]   That's why he says, "do not give in to yourself."
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.520]   In Colossians 2, 21-23, it says, "Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch," and he's referring
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.480]   obviously to the law.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:16.340]   "Refer to things that all perish as they are used, according to human precepts and teachings."
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:21.760]   These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion, asceticism,
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.760]   and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.760]   flesh.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.200]   Commandments that tell us that you ought to do this, and you ought to do this, and you
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.680]   should live in this way, all of these things have some value because it tells us what is
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.440]   right and what is wrong.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.840]   It may give us a glimpse of God's standard and His holiness, but it says it has no value,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:51.040]   it has no power to stop us from going ahead and doing these things.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.840]   Again, when we get to Romans chapter 7, we're going to dive into it a little bit further,
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.320]   but just to kind of give you a glimpse because it's related to what Paul is saying here.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.520]   Romans chapter 7, 14 or 15 and on, you know that passage, well I'm going to read this
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:12.800]   to you, where Paul is wrestling in desiring to obey the law but having no power.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.960]   Just like Paul says in Colossians 2.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:20.920]   He says, "I do not understand my own actions, for I do not do what I want, but I do the
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.120]   very thing I hate."
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.640]   How many of you have felt that even this week?
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.800]   I want to do what's right, but you feel absolutely helpless and you feel like you're not making
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   any progress.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.960]   He said, "Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law that it is good."
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.520]   In other words, the law to a Jew is revealed and says, "You know, that's good."
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.240]   No Jew would have ever said that the law is not good.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.320]   In fact, the Bible itself says that law is good.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.720]   It is a light unto my path.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:59.960]   But a Jew, in his natural state, looks at the law and says, "I agree with the law, but
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.600]   I have no power to do anything about it."
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.480]   So imagine how frustrating this is to a Jew.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.480]   So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me, for I know that nothing
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.040]   good dwells in me, that is in my flesh.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:21.360]   For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.800]   For what I do not do, the good that I want, but the evil I do not want, is what I keep
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.000]   on doing, it dwells in my members.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.040]   What a frustrating state to be in.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.040]   The desire to do something, to see the goodness of God.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.680]   You look at the law of God and it reveals who He is.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:48.040]   It's like looking at a path that's going to lead to life and have no ability to take it.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:53.920]   The law points us and it highlights who God is and it highlights His glory.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.480]   That was the whole point of the temple, the whole point of the revelation of God's law,
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.600]   because it reveals His glory.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:09.540]   And so the Jew, in his natural state, sees that glory, but has no ability to get there.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:14.820]   And that's why he concludes this section by saying, "Oh, what a wretched man that I am.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:19.240]   Who will deliver me from this body of death?"
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:27.240]   That's why religious people who have not converted are the most miserable people in this world.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.600]   People who know what is right and wrong.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.760]   And all they see from that is condemnation.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.360]   I think about the group, the Westboro Baptists, and I'm sure you guys have heard of them,
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.680]   and again, I cringe every time the Baptist word gets attached to their church name.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.800]   Because these are the guys who are protesting and saying, you know, all these homosexuals
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:53.080]   are going to go to hell, and all the message that they're giving to the world is condemnation.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:15:00.880]   Religious people who know all the rights and wrong, and yet have not been converted, have
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.360]   actually no ability to get to God.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.800]   They don't understand.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.520]   All they know is condemnation.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.720]   So the first thing that he says is the whole point of the law is to bring us to that point.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.560]   But if we ended the sermon here, if Paul's message ended with, "Oh, what a wretched man
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.320]   that I am.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.000]   Who will deliver me from this body of death?"
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.400]   I mean, what a miserable position for us to be in.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.200]   And I think sometimes as Christians, that's where we end, even though we may not say it,
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.480]   but somehow in our psychology, in our theology, we end with, "Oh, what a wretched, I'm such
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.620]   a sinner.
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.160]   I have no ability to do anything.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.160]   It's so frustrating."
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.600]   And then we end, and we think that that's what Christianity is about.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.520]   We know what it's good to do, but I have no power to do it, so I'm frustrated the rest
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.040]   of my life until I get to heaven.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.360]   But that's not where he ends.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:55.440]   He says the reason why God allowed the law to come to increase sin is for the second
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:01.320]   part is to increase grace, so that grace may abound.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.940]   Where sin abounded, he says, grace abounded all the more.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.200]   And that's the message that he was giving in the previous passage.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:12.560]   In Romans 5, verse 15, it says, "If many die through one man's trespasses, much more have
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.520]   the grace of God and the free gift by the grace."
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.840]   Up to this point, Paul's been pounding, "You are a sinner."
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.160]   There's now, no, not one, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.920]   Jews and Gentiles alike are under condemnation.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.040]   The wrath of God is being revealed against all ungodliness and righteousness, and over
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.240]   and over and over again.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:40.280]   He paints a dark and gloomy picture of mankind, and yet now he introduces this grace, and
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:48.180]   he says, as dark as grace was, as dark as sin was and death was, grace abounds much
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.180]   more.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:54.120]   Again, in Romans 5, verse 17, "If because of one man's trespass, death reigned through
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:59.040]   that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace."
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.720]   So a few weeks ago, when we were going through that passage, we're like, basically what Paul
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.880]   was saying is Jesus' power to save is much greater than the power to sin.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.920]   The power of life is much greater than the power of death, and the power of justification
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:17.360]   is much greater than the power of condemnation.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.680]   God allows the darkness to take its course.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:27.360]   He allows it to be as dark as it can possibly be, so that when he turns the light on, that
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:33.280]   the light would shine brighter than it would have been without the darkness.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.400]   Some of you guys are really gifted in organizing.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.200]   You guys are organizing Nazis.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.760]   You're experts.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.800]   And I know some of you guys.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.000]   Because I'm not that way, I'm always impressed by people who just like give, and they're
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.640]   so detail-oriented.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:56.760]   Your gifts are highlighted when there's a mess.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.520]   When there's a mess.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.240]   If you come into a situation where everything is just perfectly in order, and you come in
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.640]   and say, "I'm gifted," your gifts aren't going to shine.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.880]   Your gifts shine when there's a mess.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:14.440]   If you happen to be very tidy, your expertise and tidiness, it shines when there's a messy
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.120]   room or messy house.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.920]   The love of Christ is highlighted in darkness.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.040]   The darker he allowed it to be, the greater focus was when Christ came and turned the
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.680]   light on.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:36.160]   The Scripture says that God came and sent his only begotten Son at just the right time.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.200]   Just the right time.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.400]   And we can look at the just as right time as the Roman government, the language being
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.760]   united, the culture, the ability to travel, the political environment at that time, the
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.280]   money being united.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.920]   We can say all of that.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:56.520]   But you know, God wasn't waiting for the Romans to come into power.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:03.240]   God wasn't waiting because he couldn't have paved the road when the Greeks were there.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.320]   I don't think superficially that all may be true, but in the end, when he says "just the
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:14.120]   right time," he was allowing the law to take its natural effect.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:19.680]   Where condemnation, where you get to the point, allow the Jews to get to a point of such idolatry,
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:25.240]   they were in such darkness, that the very God that they were worshipping all these years
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.520]   actually stands in front of them and they don't recognize him.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:35.480]   They've been making sacrifice after sacrifice, worshipping this God, and then he comes incarnate
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.000]   and they don't recognize him.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.040]   That's how far they drifted away from him.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:47.200]   If you look at his ministry, three years of revealing himself to the nation of Israel.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.520]   He wasn't this gradual light turning on.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:57.400]   In fact, if you study the Gospel, you'll see that at the end of three years of labor, they
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.040]   utterly reject him.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:05.200]   John 6, 66, when he says "you're coming after me because you want to eat, but I am the bread
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.200]   of life.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.480]   He who does not eat of my flesh and drink of my blood, he has nothing to do with me
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.480]   and they don't understand.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.920]   This is too difficult."
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.920]   And they reject him and they walk away.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:21.680]   How many times have you thought that maybe if I was there when Jesus actually walked
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.640]   on water, my faith would be stronger.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.560]   Maybe if I actually ate the bread and the fish that those people ate, that my faith
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.560]   would be stronger.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.440]   How many times have you fantasized and thought about that?
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.440]   If Jesus showed himself here and we had somebody lame and he raised them and they're walking
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.160]   around, how it would strengthen your faith.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.160]   Well guess what?
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.800]   Thousands of people were there.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.960]   Thousands of people were actually there.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.040]   They saw all of that.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.660]   They saw the miracles.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.240]   They ate the bread.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:58.760]   And yet at the end of his revelation, at the end of walking with them, they reject him.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:04.040]   Not only do they reject him, the leaders of Israel who was given the responsibility to
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:11.160]   represent God to his people, they themselves actually make the decision to crucify him.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:19.480]   And it was at the darkest period of Israel's history that Jesus goes toward the cross and
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.140]   he shines the light upon the grace of God.
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:29.560]   He allows the darkness to be as dark as possible because it is when it is darkest when his
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.200]   grace shines the brightest.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.960]   Where sin abounded, grace abounded that much more.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.360]   Many guys know the song "Amazing Grace" and I'm just going to read the first verse to
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.360]   you.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.360]   It says, "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.200]   I once was lost but now I'm found, was blind but now I see."
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.040]   And I know many of you, if not all of you, know this song.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.040]   Non-Christians know this song.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.880]   So every once in a while you'll hear it in movies, Christian or not.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:03.560]   Not too long ago, President Obama stood with the Congress and they were gathered together
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.640]   and they started singing this song.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:13.120]   I mean, in and of itself, the songs and the writing in and of itself is powerful.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:19.640]   But when you understand the man who wrote this song and his testimony behind this song,
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.880]   it brings a different light.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:29.800]   There's a man named John Newton, born 1725, and he was born, his mother, who was a Puritan,
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.720]   died when he was at the age of seven.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:38.000]   And his father was at most a nominal Christian, probably not a Christian, and happened to
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.060]   be a captain of a boat.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.360]   And so from a very young age, he followed his father around, eventually became a soldier
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.280]   in the British Army or the Navy.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.800]   But he had such rebellion in his heart, he kept on getting into trouble one after another.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.080]   And eventually he got demoted.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:59.960]   He was maybe a sergeant of the boat and he ended up getting demoted.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:05.680]   And as a demotion, he asked that he would be transferred to a slave boat.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.720]   And no one asked for that because the slave boat is actually further down.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.200]   I mean, it's a nasty place to work.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.200]   And he said, "You know what?
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.480]   I don't want to be demoted and humiliated.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.120]   I'd rather be over there."
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:23.260]   So he got actively recruited or part of the slave boat and he became a slave trader.
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:28.960]   And he worked under a particular slave trader who was known for his cruelty.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.040]   And so he began to carry this out.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:37.080]   Well, one day the ship hits a storm and they're all about to die.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.360]   And in his desperation, he cries out to God.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.440]   And he says, "God, if you save me from this, I will convert and I will serve you."
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.400]   God answers his prayer and saves him from that.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.280]   But that's not where conversion happens.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.560]   He doesn't stop the slave trade.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.560]   He knew himself.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.000]   No one had to tell him that what he was doing was cruel and it was immoral.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.360]   But he doesn't stop because that's what he knows.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.920]   So for several years after that, he would continue on this trade until he gets absolutely
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.400]   sick and he was on his deathbed.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.640]   And again, he cries out for mercy, "God, this time I mean it.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.840]   And if you forgive my sins, I will give my life to you."
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.480]   And he will say that that's when he truly converted.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.280]   And after his conversion, he leaves the slave trade.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.480]   He becomes a pastor.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:28.760]   And as a pastor, he influences a young politician, William Wilberforce, who actually begins to
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.160]   represent and tries to abolish slavery.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.280]   And it is in that context that this was a testimony.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.600]   This song wasn't simply about just any grace.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.480]   It was his personal testimony that he wrote in this letter, in this hymn.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.720]   So let me read that to you again in that light.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:51.640]   "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me."
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:56.080]   He wasn't just talking about a generic understanding of a sinner.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.720]   I don't think there was anybody at that time, Christian or non-Christian, who would have
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.400]   disagreed with him that he was a wretch.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.120]   He treated human beings.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:10.760]   When he says, "a wretch like me," truly he was a wretch.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.480]   "I once was lost, but now I'm found.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.000]   Was blind, but now I see.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.160]   'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:24.240]   How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.000]   Through many dangers, toils, and snares, I have already come."
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.840]   So again, you can understand as a person who already faced death twice.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.120]   Again, this is his testimony.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.240]   "Through many dangers, toils, and snares, I have already come, 'tis grace has brought
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.400]   me safe thus far.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.440]   And grace will lead me home."
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.040]   You can see his testimony behind this.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.760]   "And Lord has promised good to me, his word my hope secures.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.560]   He will my shield and portion be as long as life endures.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:00.020]   Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail, and mortal life shall cease, I shall possess
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.920]   within the veil a life of joy and peace."
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:10.880]   In other words, when he encountered this grace, that it was so overwhelming, he says, "my
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.920]   hope and my peace is not here.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.800]   It's when I die, when my flesh is gone, that's what I look forward to.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.240]   The earth shall soon dissolve like snow, the sun forbear to shine, but God who called me
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.800]   here below will be forever mine."
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.560]   When we read this, in and of itself, it's powerful.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:37.240]   When you understand the man, and just how dark his life was, and that it is from that
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.080]   that God saves him.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:46.600]   So when the scripture says that just the right time, sometimes in our lives, God will
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:52.640]   allow us to take whatever it is that we are in to its logical course, because God is waiting
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.480]   for us to cry out to him.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:03.280]   Until we see sin as utterly sinful, we will not see grace as amazing.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.400]   And he will allow us to take that path.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.800]   And that's why he says the law was given.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:15.920]   When God's love shines brightest, it is when we least deserve it.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.400]   Think about your own lives.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.000]   Think about the time that you remember the most, where the love of God was the most precious
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   to you.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.640]   Wasn't it at a time when you felt that you least deserved it, and yet God loved you?
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:38.320]   God's love is demonstrated toward us in that while we were yet sinners in rebellion, blasphemous,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:44.360]   had no interest in serving and honoring God, and that's when he reveals his love toward
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.360]   us.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:52.160]   Romans 8, 2-4 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.160]   the law of sin and death.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:58.240]   For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do, by sending his own
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.640]   Son in the likeness of sinful flesh; and for sin he condemned sin in the flesh, in order
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.040]   that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us."
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:10.160]   See, that's a follow-up of what he says in verse 24 in Romans.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.520]   "Oh, what a wretched man that I am!
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.640]   Who will deliver me from this body of death?
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.200]   Just thanks be to God, for there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:26.000]   For what the law could not do, Christ did."
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.960]   Law was given to us that sin may be utterly sinful, but that wasn't the ultimate purpose.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.680]   The ultimate purpose was so that grace may abound, the darker it became.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:41.280]   The third and final is, again, over and beyond.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.400]   And that's typically how God works.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.720]   When God knows we need something, and God desires to give us something, he always does
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.440]   abundant and beyond.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.840]   That's the pattern that we see in the Old Testament, that's the pattern we see in the
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.840]   New Testament.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:01.040]   He says that grace may reign in righteousness, so that as sin reigned in death, grace also
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.440]   may reign through righteousness.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:11.880]   When we talk about reign, we don't know what reigning means, because we don't live in a
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.800]   monarchy.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.720]   The President of the United States is the most powerful politician in the United States,
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.520]   but the United States government has a bunch of check and balances.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.480]   So President Obama can't make law by himself.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.720]   He can introduce it, but he can't make the law.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:34.040]   He has the judiciary side of the government, he has the legislative side of the government,
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:39.720]   he's accountable to his cabinet, he's accountable to his delegates, he's accountable to the
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.540]   people of the country.
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:45.280]   He doesn't have a lot of power, because it's designed that way.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:50.080]   When we talk about reigning, reigning means like a king who can do whatever he wants.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.600]   A king can come in and say, "You know, that's my house," and he can take it.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.480]   He can change the law if he wanted.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.120]   Take as many brides as he wants.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:04.400]   So the word reign means that it has absolute dominance over everything.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.920]   And that's the word that is used to describe sin.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.840]   Sin in death absolutely reigned over everything.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.260]   You know what that means?
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:21.720]   Every human relationship is tainted by sin.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:28.520]   Your marriage, as much as you come together, "Our marriage is going to be different.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.000]   She's going to complete my sentence.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   She's my soulmate.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.880]   We're going to share everything."
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:40.120]   Then as soon as you get married, it's like, "I married a sinner."
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.960]   It tainted everything.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:46.520]   And you think like, "Oh, but not with my children.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.520]   My children are going to be the smartest kid in the world.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.960]   They're always going to be obedient."
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.760]   Not like those kids, you know.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.000]   "My kid's going to be different."
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.240]   And every parent starts out thinking that their kid is going to be different than every
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.240]   other kid.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.320]   And as soon as you start raising kids, "Huh, he's a sinner."
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.000]   Maybe even more than that kid, you know.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.400]   Sin reigned, it says.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.800]   It reigns in our health.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:20.240]   And then we all get surprised when we go to work and our bosses are selfish.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.880]   And people are slandering us, like, "I can't believe these people are like this."
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.080]   And then you move jobs thinking like, "I can't work here."
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.080]   No, huh, the same here.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:33.080]   You have a bunch of friends, it's like, "Yeah, these people are like this."
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:37.680]   And then you go over there, "Huh, it's the same over there."
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.520]   It reigns.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.320]   Every politician that comes in and say, "Those sinners, those guys don't know what they're
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.320]   doing."
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.320]   And they come in.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:50.640]   And if we've been watching politics long enough, we have absolutely no confidence.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.040]   And I don't think it's because they don't mean it.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.880]   I think they mean it.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.080]   They just don't know that they don't have the power.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.920]   It tainted families.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.920]   It taints work.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.240]   It taints even our physical health.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.240]   It taints marriages.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.280]   It taints government.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.600]   It taints everything.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.160]   Sin and death reigns.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.480]   No wonder the world is working so hard to find life.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:21.480]   Temporarily, superficially, but everybody, Christian and non-Christian alike, is looking
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.040]   for a better life.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:29.720]   But yet the Bible says as long as there is sin, death and penalty reign.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.640]   But that's not where it ends.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:39.480]   He says just as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.480]   Actually grace reigns.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.480]   Grace reigns.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:48.520]   Grace just doesn't come in and affect what we do on Sunday.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.360]   It doesn't just affect our theology.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.640]   It doesn't just affect a few relationships.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.360]   But grace has come that it may reign.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:02.520]   Paul says in 1 Timothy 1, 15-16, "The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:07.560]   that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost."
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:13.960]   I don't think he's being falsely humble when he says I am the foremost.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.960]   He really was the foremost.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.720]   This guy was a murderer.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:25.440]   First martyr of the church was killed by this guy, Stephen.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:29.640]   But I receive mercy for this reason that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:35.000]   his perfect patience as an example to those who are to believe in him for eternal life.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.440]   Paul was not chosen because of his Roman citizenship.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.800]   Paul was not chosen because he was an expert of the law.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:45.760]   Paul was not chosen because he had so much experience traveling back and forth and he
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.880]   would have been the perfect person.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.840]   Paul was not chosen because he was the best of speakers.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:57.600]   You would think that if God is going to choose a man whose primary task is to take the most
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.680]   important message, "Evangelion," good news, to the Gentile world, that you would think
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:08.880]   that the best preacher, best philosopher, the most articulate, like don't mess with
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.880]   Paul.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.880]   He'll tear you up.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.160]   He is a lawyer among lawyers.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.040]   Instead, remember what they said?
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.680]   He said his letters are strong but his appearance is weak.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:24.720]   A lot of times we interpret that as he was not a good looking guy.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.640]   His letters look impressive but when he comes, we're not impressed.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:32.080]   I don't think they were referring to his short stature or skinny or he was bald.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   Oftentimes, I've heard that so many times through commentaries, after a while, I started
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.080]   believing it.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.920]   I thought, "Oh, Paul was ugly.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.920]   He was an ugly man."
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.240]   That's what he means.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:47.560]   I don't think they were talking about his physical stature because they were comparing
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.560]   to his letters.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.360]   It wasn't like they read the letter and it's like, "Oh, he's so handsome."
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.360]   And then they were surprised, "What?"
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.320]   I don't think that was the comparison.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:04.840]   He was looking at the letter and it's so powerful and speak with such authority.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.280]   And then when he came, remember the way they described Paul in Book of Acts?
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:14.800]   He had a habit of speaking on and on and on and on and on.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.200]   If he was such a great speaker, I mean, you would think they would be riveted.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.200]   He said on and on.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.480]   Somebody just falls off and dies.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:26.720]   I've had people fall asleep in my sermons before, but no one's died yet.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.840]   This guy kills people with his sermons.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.160]   So I don't think they were talking about his stature.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.760]   I don't think he was like, "Oh, he wasn't a good looking man."
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.680]   I don't think he was the best speaker.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.440]   In fact, the reason why Apollos got all this attention is because he was such a great speaker,
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.320]   even though he was a latecomer.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.120]   Peter, we can understand.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.160]   He was a direct disciple of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.960]   He was one of the three that saw the transfiguration.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.360]   We can understand that.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.280]   We can understand, maybe even Paul.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.000]   He was such a great sinner, but Apollos, why did he get all this attention?
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.120]   He was known to be a great speaker.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.480]   So Paul was not the best speaker.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:10.080]   Paul says, "God didn't choose me because of my background, because of my Roman citizenship,
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.640]   because I was connected to the Sanhedrin.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.640]   None of that.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.800]   He said he chose me because I was the worst of sinners."
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:22.440]   And the reason why he displayed the worst of sinners is this guy who just days ago was
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:30.160]   about to kill people, now he's proclaiming that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   That that same guy who was responsible for the death of Stephen, now is proclaiming the
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.080]   gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:44.240]   That if God can save that man, we all have hope.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.240]   We all have hope.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:50.080]   See, that's what it means when grace came, grace abounded.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.080]   It reigned.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:57.040]   In 1 Corinthians 15, it says, "But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.760]   toward me was not in vain.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.760]   On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.400]   of God that is with me."
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:18.600]   Not only did he redeem Paul as a human being, he redeemed him, even his works.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:23.000]   Before he met Christ, everything that he did was for the purpose of building his righteousness.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.120]   But when the power of God came over and overwhelmed him, he said, "I worked harder than anybody
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.600]   else because of this grace."
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.360]   See, grace didn't just say, "Oh, you know, I'm saved, I'm not going to hell, that's
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.360]   great."
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:41.240]   Paul, overwhelmed by the grace of God because of his great sin, he saw the glory of God
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.040]   probably in a brighter light because of his great sin.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.800]   As a result of that, he said, "I worked harder than anybody."
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.320]   He redeemed even his good works for his glory.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.760]   He was overwhelmed by the grace of God.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.760]   Overwhelmed by the grace of God.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.640]   See, it's not just a dabble on Sunday.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:06.600]   It's not just in Bible study or when we go out to missions or what we do at a certain
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.960]   point in our life.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:12.640]   It overwhelms us and it changes everything.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:16.560]   It changes us in conflict.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:20.480]   It changes us when we're wronged.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.520]   It changes us the way we look at finances.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.080]   It reverses the curse of mankind.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.280]   It reverses it thoroughly and completely.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:36.800]   Not just a small part of it.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:42.160]   He says, "As a result of this overwhelming grace, it ultimately leads to eternal life
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.160]   in Christ."
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.760]   And that's exactly why he said he came.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.720]   "I've come to give life and to give this life abundantly."
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.840]   He didn't just say, "I've come to give this life so that you would not just go to
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.840]   hell.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:56.720]   I've come to give this life abundantly, that you would be overwhelmed by this life."
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:01.280]   That's why when we worship God, it is not out of duty.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.960]   It's not because a Christian has to do this.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:04.960]   No.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.960]   Should we do it?
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.960]   Of course we should do it.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.960]   Should we read our Bibles?
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.600]   Of course we should read our Bibles.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.600]   Should we pray and forgive?
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.040]   Yes, we ought to pray and forgive.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:20.760]   But what God desires from us is to be so overwhelmed by the grace of God that people
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:25.360]   can't keep you away from worshiping God.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:31.400]   That you desire to be in the Word of God because that's where you find life.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.160]   In the midst of darkness in this world, think about what's happening in the Middle East
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.160]   today.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:42.460]   I mean, people are being beheaded, churches are being blown up, Christians are being raped,
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:47.960]   and yet in the context of all of that, the Scripture says people are seeing Christ as
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:54.720]   a Savior more powerfully today in that area than in the last hundred years of mission
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:55.720]   endeavor.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.000]   And some of you guys may have read the same articles I have.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.640]   They said there's more Muslims, moderate Muslims, who are turning to Christ than any other modern
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.720]   time that we can think of.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:10.880]   In the midst of beheading, in the midst of persecution, where His grace is overwhelming
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:16.200]   them and they're coming to Christ.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.640]   We are to be overwhelmed by the grace of God.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:25.320]   That our relationship is not done grudgingly because He loved us.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:29.400]   I'm going to finish with a story that I told years ago, and some of you guys may remember,
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.680]   some of you guys may not.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.880]   It's the how the birds got their wings.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.560]   And I know some of you guys are going to roll your eyes because, oh, again.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:41.260]   But I thought it would be appropriate for today as I wrap up this sermon about how the
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.520]   birds got their wings.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.160]   The birds are pretty pathetic creatures without their wings.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.480]   They got their little beak and little, you know, little stem legs.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:53.280]   And because of that, they are targeted, you know, in the jungle.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.320]   So they were the servants of the monkeys.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.680]   They carry the bananas for them wherever they want them to take it.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.960]   So pretty pathetic creatures, right?
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.200]   So the one day the angels were flying above and they see and they have pity on them.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.560]   So the angels decide, hey, well, let's go down there and sacrifice and give them our
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.200]   wings.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.760]   So the angels come out and they sacrifice, take their wings off and give it to them.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.120]   But initially they don't understand what these wings are.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.480]   So they take these wings and it's enough to carry the bananas.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.480]   But now we've got to carry these burdensome wings.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.160]   They're even heavier than bananas.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.520]   So they're walking and trying to run away from the monkeys and they're running into
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.520]   the trees with their wings.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.740]   It's like, what is this?
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.740]   What a cruel joke.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.360]   Our life is hard enough as it is.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:38.560]   And now you give us now on top of that, we have to carry these wings.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.360]   And so those who didn't understand what they were, they died off.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.760]   And that's why they're no longer here.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.760]   And that's why we only have birds that have wings.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:51.760]   A few of them, some of you guys are so serious.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:57.720]   It's not a real story, all right?
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:01.600]   Some of these birds, remember it's like, hey, wait a second.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.720]   I remember those angels were flying around.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.240]   Could it possibly be that the wings were the reason why they were able to fly?
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.240]   Wouldn't it be awesome?
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.680]   I mean, you could fly like they flew.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.080]   So they decided to take a chance.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.720]   And what have we got to lose, right?
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:18.600]   The worst case scenario, we die and we're no longer slaves in the jungle.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:23.120]   So some of them go up to the highest part of the jungle and they fly off and they spread
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.840]   their wings and they begin to fly.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:33.960]   So take your bananas.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:37.600]   So they became these majestic creatures who are flying.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:42.800]   And again, that's how the birds got their wings.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:49.760]   Sometimes as Christians, we take the grace of God and make it a burden.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.240]   We may worship a burden.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.520]   We make prayer a burden.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.520]   Make fellowship a burden.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.040]   And evangelism a burden.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:07.080]   Not recognizing that this is a gift that was given to us for life.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.360]   Sometimes we don't recognize what it is.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:15.720]   God gave us this so that we will be overwhelmed by the love of God.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:21.080]   Let me read you a verse before I wrap up and ask the team to come up.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.240]   In Isaiah 40, 29-31, you guys know this passage well.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.840]   It says, "He gives power to the faint and to him who has no might, he increases strength.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.320]   Even youth shall faint and be weary and young men shall fall exhausted.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:38.400]   But they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength and they shall mount up with
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.640]   wings like eagles.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.280]   They shall run and not be weary.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.560]   They shall walk and not faint."
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:50.080]   I pray that the grace of God would overwhelm us.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.600]   That everything that we do would simply be a reasonable response to the mercy that he
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:54.600]   showed us.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.880]   Would you take a few minutes to pray with us?
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.960]   Take some time to reflect upon the Lord.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:07.240]   If the grace of God has become a burden to you, take a minute to take a step back and
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:12.720]   to really come before the Lord and ask the Lord to open your eyes.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.680]   You may again come to that same love that saved you.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.240]   Remember the height from which you had fallen, repent and redo the things that you did at
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.240]   first.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:26.200]   As our worship team leads us, let's take some time to reflect and come before the Lord and
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:32.520]   surrender that our life that God desires for us may be abundant enough.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.760]   So let's take some time to pray.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.380]   .
