[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   >> Okay, great, good afternoon, everybody.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.280]   I was a little bit worried that right after lunch, we'd all be a little sleepy.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.580]   Good thing they have this room down to ice cold.
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.320]   >> [LAUGH] >> So that we can all sleep.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.800]   Now, the second session is entitled,
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.520]   The Anchor Family, and we're gonna walk through being anchored in Christ.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.400]   This arena is of our life.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.880]   And I'm so very thankful for the last session that we had.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.240]   In thinking about, ultimately, our salvation, and
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.720]   thinking about a key concept like purpose.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.440]   Now, what I'm saying is I'm really digging the entire analogy or
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.520]   illustration of the anchor, long term, things like that.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.800]   Because truly when it comes to these major stages of our lives,
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.440]   whether it be that we're moving from student life to young adult life.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.600]   Or moving from young adult life to singlehood and marriage.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.000]   And ultimately then starting your own family.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.880]   And then you're moving to another stage where you have children.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.680]   Within each of these stages, there is a drift.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.400]   Meaning there is a potential threat of strain because there's so
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.200]   many different things that come at you, right?
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.200]   Whether it be temptations, distractions.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.360]   You can even literally call it storms because sometimes
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.560]   it's incredibly difficult to navigate through these things.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.120]   When it comes to starting a family, you guys have experienced that maybe
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.240]   some of these distractions, the difficulties, are more intense.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.080]   Because it simply gets multiplied.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.520]   You thought you were busy when you were single.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.600]   And the next thing you know, you're like, well, goodness.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.280]   The busyness just tripled, quadrupled.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.560]   And some of you guys, whatever the term is for six people, right?
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.480]   You just got bigger and bigger.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.320]   And what's more, you experience your fatigue grow at an exponential rate.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.560]   How tired you are.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.680]   And people are looking at each other like, man, you think you're tired.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.880]   Let me tell you how tired I am.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.920]   And people are all competing with each other, talking about how tired we are.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.200]   Okay?
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.240]   But in the midst of all those various storms,
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.680]   whether it be not only fatigue and tiredness, but the worries.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.200]   The worry multiplies.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.160]   The concern, right?
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.880]   It's multifaceted.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.760]   Within these things, we recognize that we absolutely need an anchor.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.920]   And it's so good that we're thinking on the lines of,
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.720]   Jesus Christ is absolutely our stronghold.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.040]   But the paradoxical thing about our Christian lives
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.160]   is that He is not simply an anchor so that we can walk this earthly life well.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.440]   He is also the goal, right?
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.400]   He is the anchor to the goal of Him, to pursue Him.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.480]   And so I was so thankful that Pastor Peter Chung reminded us
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.000]   that not only is our desire to be in Him, but our purpose is for Him.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.200]   And so if you guys recall, the statement that he said multiple times was,
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.280]   "Front to end, everything God."
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.600]   So we were created by God, created for God, to love God and serve God.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.200]   Excellent way to summarize our purpose.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:30.320]   Now, as we think about this, and we have our verse here.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.320]   Sorry.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:40.440]   Our verse here put into a nice graphic that I found on the internet.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.320]   And there's something interesting about it.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.240]   We recognize that Jesus Christ is the absolute stronghold.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.440]   We recognize that He is weighty.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.480]   He's glorious.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.840]   He's wonderful, and beautiful.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.080]   And what's more, Jesus Christ should be what we're looking to.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.000]   But one of the core questions that Pastor Peter Chung left off with in the last sermon
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.760]   is that where is your linkage to that?
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.200]   Notice how in this graphic up here, there is no chain.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.280]   And what I want to do is actually focus on this idea that we absolutely need to,
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.720]   yes, maintain and strengthen the linkage, the connection, and the chain
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.080]   that we have to Christ.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.600]   Because yes, conceptually, we can all agree and confess Jesus Christ is a stronghold.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.920]   But where are your chains?
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.960]   To what degree have you tied yourself to that stronghold?
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.480]   And what is the current status?
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.480]   Is it well-maintained?
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.920]   Is it strong?
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.400]   Or on the flip side, is it unclear?
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.200]   Is another photo for your class?
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.880]   Is it all rusty and worn down?
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.000]   I had a picture for you just a moment ago of this photo.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.320]   And some random facts for you guys.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.880]   This is a US ship.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.680]   I think it's called the--
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.760]   I have it there.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.360]   The US NIMIS.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.240]   Cool fact is that their chain is so weak, it actually outweighs the anchor.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.440]   An analogy-- don't try to think about the Christian spiritual analysis
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.280]   from there.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.280]   What I'm saying is, how important is it to actually maintain that chain?
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.400]   You have these individuals who have a 60,000-pound anchor.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.040]   But in terms of the chain, the whole of the chain that they have on the boat
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.760]   is 244,000 pounds of chain.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.320]   And they have to maintain that because over time, it rusts.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.120]   My question to you is, how strong is your family's link to Christ?
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.040]   To what degree have you given attention to these things?
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.560]   And so what I'd like to focus on in this sermon
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.120]   is the part of the identity, priority, and the activity of the family
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.280]   as links to the solid anchor that is Christ.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.760]   The identity, the priority, and the activity of the family
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.240]   has served as links to the solid anchor that is Christ.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.240]   So let me begin by saying this.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.240]   A Christ-anchored family has a family identity tied to Christ.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.720]   The Christ-anchored family has a family identity tied to Christ.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.200]   Now, if you think about that, when we thought the term "identity,"
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.720]   it's a huge term.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.680]   It's a little vague.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.680]   And so we have to identify a little bit.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.160]   And we actually have to define it.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160]   The best and simplest way to say it is identity
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160]   is just talking about who you are as a whole.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.160]   And that's why it's so broad.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.640]   It's simply what describes and defines you.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.120]   And so people can look to all sorts of things-- your purpose, your skill.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.600]   And on a worldly level, that's how people typically identify themselves.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.480]   They identify themselves by what they see.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.480]   So when it comes to family, and not just you as an individual--
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.960]   you as an individual may be thinking about your skill set,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.360]   your personal looks.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.480]   Well, that translates to family, too.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.000]   People are very concerned about family honor.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.400]   People are very concerned about being a respectful family in the community.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.800]   That's why certain individuals cannot, cannot bear the idea of having
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.400]   their children fail school.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.760]   No way.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.920]   Not my kid.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.000]   What's more, do families--
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.960]   are they concerned just like an individual is about the produce,
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.160]   meaning what they can actually contribute to society?
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.640]   Do they care about family income?
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.440]   Yes, they do.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.720]   Do they care about family possessions?
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.920]   Is home ownership not a struggle?
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.280]   Of course it is.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.480]   Of course it is.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.520]   The other day, me and a buddy were talking about that thing,
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.840]   and how that thing is a killer of time.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.520]   If you guys have ever had that itch, and you wanted to live for homes,
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.200]   and next thing you know, you're on that thing, all of a sudden,
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.840]   you think, oh my goodness, it's been an hour.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.440]   You've been searching for a long time.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:08.940]   Why?
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.280]   Because your interest and your desire and longing is there.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.920]   To look for homes, to look for own values,
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.000]   to look for things that could be answers for you.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.640]   All I'm saying is this.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.000]   All of those things are visible, tangible things.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.500]   Why?
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.400]   Because this world operates by sight.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.960]   Your identity is based on what you can see.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.960]   But believers, we as Christians, our identity
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:39.120]   is 100% wrapped up in the unseen gift of God.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.880]   God gives you an identity based on faith, and that identity, he says,
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.200]   is in the person of Jesus Christ, whom you do not see right now,
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.720]   but whom you love.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.200]   And I have given him to you.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.720]   And what's more, I'm going to complete that in the days to come.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.200]   Now, Blankey turned your Bibles to 1 John 3, verse 2 to 3.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.760]   Pastor Peter referenced it.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.320]   It is a beautiful passage concerning your identity, which
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.560]   is already and yet to be fulfilled.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.080]   So it's 1 John 3, verse 2 to 3.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.560]   OK?
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.640]   In talking about our Christian identity,
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.680]   the way I've kind of briefly summarized it
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.520]   is that you have an identity given by God,
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.840]   given to you by faith, yet to be fully realized.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.200]   Do you understand that?
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.520]   Pastor John says this, beloved, that we are children of God.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.840]   That's an identity thing.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.120]   You are, in terms of your essence, in terms of your relational being,
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.240]   in terms of your definition, you are a child of God.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.640]   And it has not yet appeared as yet what we will be.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.640]   We know that when He appears, we will be what?
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.680]   Like Him.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.080]   Because we will see Him just as He is.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.840]   And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself,
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.040]   just as He is pure.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.280]   So you bring those two things together in terms
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.240]   of what we've been studying and what we've been thinking about in terms
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.600]   of being this incredible hope, the hope of God's promise,
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.360]   the promise that you will be with me and you
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.720]   are able to enter into my presence forever because of Christ,
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.560]   and that this promise does not change because His oath never changes
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.680]   and because His word never changes, His character never changes,
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.400]   and He is not a God who lies.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.720]   Now as we think about that, I ask you this question.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.920]   Pastor Peter challenges us.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.040]   God has given us a purpose.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.800]   He's given us a vision of what our families should be.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:49.800]   This world is constantly trying to look at themselves.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.520]   They're staring at themselves in the mirror saying, who am I?
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.480]   And when they are able to produce, oh, I broke my leg
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.160]   and can't play basketball.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.800]   Who am I?
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   I lost my job and can't make money.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.960]   Who am I?
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.960]   They're constantly looking at themselves and wondering, who am I?
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.840]   Who am I?
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.480]   But we as Christians are not operated by science.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.280]   Now, as Pastor Peter said, we have been created by God.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.520]   That's an identity statement.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.720]   We've been created for God.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.920]   That's an identity statement.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.040]   And we are to love Him and serve Him.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.040]   That we know is a vision also for our families.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.920]   The main question for you then is, have you accepted that?
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.520]   Do you desire and long for that vision for your family
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.600]   where in 1 John he says, you are going to be like Him?
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:50.480]   God wants Christ's character in you as an individual and in your home?
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.040]   Is that the vision for your family?
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.640]   Have you not only accepted that, but have you desired it and longed for it?
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.800]   You see, in my mind-- I'm not going to go on about this for too long.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.560]   But in my mind, when individuals struggle with an identity crisis,
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.360]   and they're sitting there thinking, oh my gosh, I don't know who I am.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.480]   It's not really, really, I don't know who I am.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.200]   If we were honest, the statement is, I don't like who I am.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.320]   Let me repeat that.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.440]   Identity crisis is not so much like, I have no clue who I am.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.840]   I don't know what's wrong with me.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.480]   I don't know what's my deal, so to speak, in life.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.360]   If we were honest, the simple statement is, I don't like who I am.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.120]   I don't like what I see in you.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.360]   Well, guess what?
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.560]   It also could be that when God gives us His vision for our family,
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.280]   we can respond in a simple way where it's like, I see it,
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.040]   but I'm not sure I'm happy with that.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.000]   I see your vision.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.560]   I'm not sure I can take it.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.720]   The application, first and foremost, has to be for us.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:06.840]   Yes, I see a picture of what you want to do with me and my home.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.720]   You desire this place to be a place of worship, a place of truth,
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.240]   a place of love, a place of joy, a place of glorifying God
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.720]   as our assembling Christ.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.320]   Yes?
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.160]   For us, we have to be linked to that to be able to say, I want that.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.800]   That is my express desire.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.560]   I want what God has designed for my home.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.640]   And that's where it's got to start.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.320]   The application has to be, first and foremost, yes,
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.080]   that is the good design and identity, the characteristic, the expectation,
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.800]   the purpose that God has for me.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:49.480]   And not, yes, I hear you, but first, let me have my home
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.040]   with three bedrooms, 2.5 baths, 2.5 kids, and three cars.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.600]   This is sometimes the kind of vision that people have when they fantasize.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.440]   Question to you is, what kind of a vision for your family
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.720]   are you fantasizing about?
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.600]   What do you desire?
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.360]   Have you adopted the picture of a family that God has already
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.440]   given us in scripture?
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.680]   Now, as we think about that, there's a second application
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.760]   that I actually wanted to focus on here, which is this.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.880]   A clear identity of God's vision for your family
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.840]   will allow you to make clear explanation of God.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.120]   I didn't know how to best phrase this in a summary way,
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.880]   but that's the first thing I wanted to say is, you have clear identity.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.840]   This is a vision that God has for my family.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.040]   And I just gave a rundown list of it.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.400]   Because of the limitation of this sermon,
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.040]   I'm really talking about the linkage, but I do want to challenge you.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.880]   If someone asks you, what is God's expectation for a biblical family,
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.160]   and your mind goes blank, then your first application
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.680]   is, I should have really stood in the scriptures and asked,
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.720]   what are the character traits of a godly family?
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.000]   But when you see that clear identity and vision for the family,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.080]   then there should be a clear explanation of God.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.120]   And this is what I mean.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:10.120]   Please turn your Bible over to Deuteronomy 6, verses 7 through 9.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.720]   Deuteronomy 6, verses 7 through 9.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.680]   There's a corollary passage in Deuteronomy 4,
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.800]   but for the sake of time, we're going to skip it.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.880]   We're turning now to Deuteronomy 6, verses 7 through 9.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.640]   And this is that very famous, famous scenario
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.760]   where Moses brings all the people, God's people, together,
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.120]   and he is reviewing the law.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.920]   He has chapter 6, verse 1, the whole great Shema.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.160]   "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is one."
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.000]   Yes?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.200]   Moses is going to teach everybody, this is God,
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.560]   and therefore, this should be you.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.720]   And as he's doing that, this is what he says.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.560]   "You shall teach them diligently to your sons,
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.160]   and shall talk of them when you sit in your house,
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.920]   and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down,
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.120]   when you rise up, you shall bind them as a sign on your hand,
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.640]   and they shall be as frontals on your forehead.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.480]   You shall write them on the doorposts of your house,
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.360]   and on your gates."
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.560]   Observe.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.440]   Because you are a chosen nation, with a great God,
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.320]   and with an amazing law from this great God,
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.640]   you are to be filled.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.360]   I mean, if you observe that, what he's saying is,
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.520]   basically, you sit, and you write, and you're sleeping,
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.280]   all over your house, you are to be filled with God's truth.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.040]   There should be a clear explanation in your home,
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.760]   this is God.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.720]   I'm going to draw this out a little bit more.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.560]   Oops, sorry.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.840]   Please go to Psalm 78, verses one through eight.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.080]   Psalm 78, verses one through eight.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.400]   Please turn there, and we'll read together.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.760]   Psalm 78, one through eight.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.400]   So he says, "Listen, people, to my instruction,
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.880]   and climb your ears to the words of my mouth.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.040]   I will open my mouth in a parable.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.400]   I will utter dark sayings of old,
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.200]   which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.880]   We will not conceal them from their children,
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.320]   but tell to the generation to come the praises of the Lord,
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.640]   and his strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.320]   For he has got us a testimony in Jacob,
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.600]   and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.800]   that they should teach them to their children,
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.640]   that the generation to come might know even the children
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.840]   yet to be born, that they may arrive and tell them
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.600]   to their children that they should put their confidence
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.480]   in God, and not forget the works of God,
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.160]   but keep his commandments, and not be like their fathers,
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.560]   stubborn and rebellious generation,
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.760]   a generation that did not prepare its heart,
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.040]   and its spirit was not faithful to God."
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.280]   What I'm saying is, remember, my sermon here and now
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.280]   for our families is to ask, yes, you've identified
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.160]   Christ is the solution to sin, Christ is the solution
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.360]   to the tide and the storm, Christ is the solution
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.800]   to your drifting, but the question more specifically
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.640]   is where is your linkage?
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.920]   Where is your chain, right?
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.400]   And what I'm saying is, when your identity is clear,
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.880]   this is who I am in God, this is what he's done for me,
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.160]   this is what I'm supposed to do, in God's purpose for me,
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.800]   there should be a clear explanation, and this is God.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.760]   Let me make it a little bit more specific.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.520]   For those of you out there that have children,
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.600]   anytime you do something, when your children get
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.600]   to a certain age, they will ask you, "Why?"
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.280]   Hey everybody, get in the car, we're going to church.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.960]   Why are we going to church?
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.120]   Do you respond typically with that kind of annoyance,
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.240]   or we're already five minutes late,
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.200]   get in the van right now, right?
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.200]   - He's like, "Why?"
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.680]   - "Oh, did you ask me why one more time?"
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.520]   You know, "How dare you ask me why?
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.080]   "Just do what I say!"
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.920]   Right?
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.880]   I'm pretty sure you don't use that voice.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.720]   But when the children start asking why,
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.720]   it is, you know, it hits on our nerves.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.480]   But think about this.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:09.280]   We believers in Christ who have an identity in Christ,
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.000]   our linkage that's clean, that's maintained,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.400]   always can answer the why.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.120]   Why in the world do you go to church so often?
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.000]   Because we know we have the death,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.840]   we have everything, we have everything.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.320]   That would be a formal answer.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:29.120]   Why are we not able to give the appropriate answers?
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.720]   Look, good question.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.160]   Do you know how good God has been today?
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.640]   In my mind.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.800]   Do you know how amazingly God has lavished his love?
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.520]   All the amazing, you know,
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.000]   when he started talking about the mosquito,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.240]   I was like, "Oh my gosh."
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.080]   Right?
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:47.920]   Like, do you guys feel that?
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.760]   When he's in the past,
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.400]   we were talking about the mosquito.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.240]   Like, he wanted to be one with the mosquito.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.320]   I just like, right?
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.720]   My mind was just going nuts.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:06.680]   Can we, like, when I say your identity should be clear,
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.760]   you should have a very clear answer
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.000]   from your identity to your children.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.200]   Do you know how good God has been today?
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.440]   We're gonna go because, man,
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.640]   we're gonna sing, "Thank you, Lord."
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.880]   And then if the children ask,
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.680]   "Good, how's it been good to you?"
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.920]   Then you're like, "Perfect, thank you, Lord."
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.560]   This is where I wanna teach the gospel.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.720]   Now, you might be like, "Oh, okay,
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.680]   "you know, that doesn't happen all the time.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.360]   "You know, you don't just preach the gospel
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.320]   "every time your child asks why."
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.640]   Well, I want you to think about this.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.440]   I've got some verses for you from scripture.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.000]   In Exodus chapter 12, you guys recall,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.760]   when God redeemed the nation of Israel out of Egypt,
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.600]   He established certain rituals.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.440]   You know what's crazy about that is God,
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.160]   before He even pulled them out in chapter 12,
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.720]   He told them, "I want you, as soon as you get out,
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.080]   "to start practicing some of these."
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.520]   And when you do this, look what He says,
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.920]   "When you enter the land which the Lord will give you,
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.200]   "as He has promised, you shall observe this rite."
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.600]   Okay, "And when your children say to you,
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.880]   "what does this rite mean to you,
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.960]   "you shall say, it is a Passover sacrifice
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.080]   "to the Lord who passed over the houses
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.760]   "of the sons of Israel in Egypt,
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.560]   "when He smoked the Egyptians, but spared our homes."
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.240]   God spared me, and the people bowed low in worship.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.880]   And then in Exodus chapter 13, He says,
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.560]   "You shall tell your son on that day, saying,
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.440]   "it is because of what the Lord did for me
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.000]   "when I came out of Egypt."
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.440]   Parents, husbands, wives, is your identity in Christ
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.840]   so clear you have the linkage and connection to say,
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.640]   this is why I come to worship?
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.560]   That's what I'm asking, right?
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.880]   And we might think, like, yeah,
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.720]   it's kind of awkward every time.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.960]   In this passage, pretty much back then,
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.080]   the Father commanded us to ask, right?
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.440]   You would ask me why, I'd tell you, right?
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.480]   I mean, it was almost so formal and so ritualistic,
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.720]   but literally, the Father commanded the children,
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.080]   you ask me why, right now, when I do this whole thing
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.440]   with the staff and the sash and all that stuff,
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.200]   you ask me why.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.560]   And the child's like, why?
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.160]   And the Father answered.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.480]   He goes, you know who I am?
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.480]   I was a slave, an absolute misnomer, but God loved me.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.880]   So we go to worship, right?
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.080]   Those of you who don't have children,
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.280]   there's gonna come a time when your spouse is not up for it.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.960]   I don't wanna go to church today.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.600]   I'm pretty sure it never happens here,
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.920]   but you know, sometimes, you know,
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.200]   we all have moments where we're like, oh gosh.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.800]   And we have our excuse of good reasons.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.200]   Too tired, not feeling it.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.360]   I don't know, sometimes I try,
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.200]   don't feel the reciprocation.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.440]   We have plenty of excuses and reasons why we don't wanna go.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.000]   But is your reasons clear?
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.040]   So that even if your spouse, the one you love,
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.720]   is not down for it, they say, you know what,
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.480]   tonight I'm gonna just stay home and watch the baby.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.520]   Are you prepared and your linkage so clear
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.520]   you can describe, remember, this is what we do.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.360]   Right?
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.480]   So I ask you, is the chain clear?
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.920]   To say that you have an amazing, solid,
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.520]   waiting anchor is Christ is great.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:26.760]   But would you ever use that if you had no chain?
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.360]   If you had no tie?
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.320]   That would be your first tie.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.000]   Moving on to the second one.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.120]   We know that our clear identity will build a priority.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.920]   So our identity, it builds to your priority.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.760]   Okay?
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.080]   When your identity is clear,
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.960]   it starts establishing the priorities of your life.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.640]   So I say in the second link,
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.640]   a Christ-anchored family has a priority tied to Christ.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.640]   Okay?
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.560]   They have a system of sorting their time.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.280]   They have a system of sorting their agenda,
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.360]   and they can sort it by importance and value.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.920]   Basically, if you're on an Excel sheet,
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.880]   you know how there's a little triangle and it filters?
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.400]   Is that for your whole family life?
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.840]   And I'm gonna ask you some important assessment questions
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.320]   for your family right now.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.520]   What is dictating the top agenda for your family?
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:29.160]   Okay, what is dictating the agenda for your family time?
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.760]   What is dictating the use of your energy?
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.120]   Where does most of your energy go?
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.400]   Okay?
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.400]   What is filling your family schedule?
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.080]   What do you have to constantly work around?
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.440]   What are some things that go on your family schedule
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.960]   that everything else has to work around?
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.040]   It's like, oh, we can't do it
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.680]   because we got that in there.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.080]   Some of you are like that.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.960]   I'm not saying you're bad, wicked people.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.600]   I'm just saying everybody operates on a certain function,
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.680]   and some families are a little bit more structured,
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.240]   so they already have a family schedule,
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.800]   they have a family calendar, everybody puts it in,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.520]   it's all synced on everyone's device, right?
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.680]   If that's you, great!
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.560]   This evaluation would be really, really fast for you.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:16.520]   What are the schedule items that go in there first
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.960]   and you can't move because it's so important to you?
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.320]   And everything else in life has to work around that
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.880]   on your schedule.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.080]   That is an important thing to ask, isn't it?
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.160]   It is.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.440]   It's a very important thing to ask.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.760]   It asks the question of what comes first.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.200]   Remember that for our families,
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.040]   it is the same truth that is taught
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.200]   to each disciple of Christ.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.360]   The scripture says, "Seek ye first the kingdom."
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.880]   When Christ said the word first,
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.800]   he's teaching priority, right?
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.640]   That is an ordering of your life
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.560]   based on what is most valuable and most weighty.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.720]   "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.640]   "and all these things will be added to you."
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.360]   Here's an interesting thing.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.520]   If you turn to 1 Kings 3,
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.840]   there is a real life example of this in King Solomon.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.600]   There is a real life example of this.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.120]   1 Kings 3, verse 11 through 13.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.560]   God said to him, that is Solomon,
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.320]   "Because you have asked this thing,"
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.200]   if you remember the thing,
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.240]   is King Solomon asked for wisdom.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.800]   He asked for wisdom,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.240]   "the rule I govern over the people."
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.200]   He says, "Ye have not asked for yourself long life,
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.360]   "nor have you asked riches for yourself,
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.840]   "nor have you asked for the life of your enemies,
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.760]   "but have asked for yourself discernment
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.040]   "to understand justice.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.120]   "Behold, I have done according to your words,
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.480]   "and behold, I have given you a wise and discerning heart
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.200]   "so that there have been no one like you before you,
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.560]   "nor shall one like you arise after you.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.440]   "I have also given you what you have not asked,
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.680]   "both riches and honor,
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.200]   "so that there will not be any among the kings like you
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.000]   "all your days."
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.600]   Jesus said, "Seek his righteousness first."
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.960]   In this period of time, King Solomon searched
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.280]   for that which is more weighty in God's eyes.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.520]   I want you guys to think about that for your family.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.800]   Has there been consideration and question and evaluation?
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.760]   Where has our first agenda,
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.320]   first top tier energy,
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.160]   first considerations gone?
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.920]   Has it been to pack our schedule
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.000]   with every single experience in life?
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.280]   We gotta make sure to go visit every single monument
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.200]   in the US, and every single monument in South America,
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.880]   and every single experience that I've had,
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.440]   anybody can experience in this life,
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.600]   I want my kids to have.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.040]   I want my family to have.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.800]   We gotta do this.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.560]   Has that been the case?
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.920]   Now remember, we're talking priority here.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.160]   If some of you are into traveling, that's fine.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.120]   But has that been the determining factor
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.160]   of your schedule for the next two years?
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.720]   Right?
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.480]   There are individuals so dedicated to entertainment,
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.240]   they've literally scheduled themselves
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.600]   of how to be entertained for the next three seasons.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.840]   I'm gonna watch this episode,
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.000]   I'm gonna watch that episode,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.560]   and they've scheduled it in.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.440]   Now, if that's you, there has to be this question.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:30.280]   Has this more scheduled in my spiritual life?
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.760]   Am I constantly, every time I smile,
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.680]   saying, "Oh, I can't even fit in my quiet time.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.320]   "I can't fit in family worship.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.320]   "I know I should talk to my wife
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.760]   "about where I am spiritually."
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.080]   It just can't seem to fit in.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.840]   And yet you've got the next four seasons scheduled.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.160]   That's, you've gotta really assess that.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.440]   So as we think about this,
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.960]   I wanna give you a little example here.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.800]   Have you guys seen,
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.040]   there's a YouTube series called Worth It?
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.920]   You guys know what I'm talking about?
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.280]   For those of you who are foodies,
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.560]   it's like your dream job ever.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.400]   (laughs)
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.640]   It's like your fantasy dream.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.160]   Basically what it is, you have these two young guys,
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.000]   they say, "Okay, we're gonna see what's worth it.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.300]   "We're gonna go in and try three types of tacos.
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.100]   "One taco's $2, but it's amazing.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.140]   "One taco's $12, and it's on the next year,
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.140]   "and there's a $100 taco."
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.480]   And basically what these guys do is they go and eat it.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.860]   Now the reason why I find it just awesome
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.900]   is 'cause people love food.
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.980]   It's like, "I wish I had your job, man."
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.660]   'Cause they just sit there and they slobber away.
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:36.500]   They're like, "Mm."
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.100]   But what's really cool about it is they start talking,
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.780]   it's like, "Man, it's $2 for an amazing taco,
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.100]   "but it's the greatest and the most expensive, the best?"
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:50.220]   And they're like, "Ooh, how do we decide?
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.180]   "Why do I bring this silly example up?"
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.820]   When people talk about Orange County Christianity
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:01.260]   and how difficult it is, well, obviously,
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.820]   it's not difficult as in it's like strenuous
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.500]   and suffering, right?
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.060]   I believe the difficulty comes
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.700]   because you have way too many options.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.260]   And with the many options that you have,
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.300]   you want it all, right?
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.740]   I'm just kind of grossly summarizing
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.060]   Orange County Christianity and its difficulty.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.220]   But essentially, you have so many options
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:25.380]   and you want all of them.
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.140]   You want a manageable home, you want a manageable church,
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.420]   you want a manageable work schedule
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.020]   with a manageable family life.
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.240]   And if you can have all of it,
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.580]   that's your Orange County dream.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.700]   Yeah.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.380]   And what's really interesting about that show
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.460]   is you have these individuals that,
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:40.660]   "I can't decide."
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.500]   Because why?
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.900]   "I want it all."
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.860]   "Give me the hundred dollar,
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.940]   the $12,000, the $2,000 top of all day."
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.780]   Right?
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.140]   That would be a dream.
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.380]   But you're forced to decide.
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.020]   There are some of us that have a hard time choosing
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.140]   what should be priority.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.340]   My challenge to you is, as a family,
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.420]   you have to decide.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.420]   Is our family going to fulfill the Orange County dream
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.220]   of having everything?
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.420]   Every experience, every luxury,
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.420]   and every dream of the Orange County life?
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:15.460]   Or are we going to, by necessity, pick our priorities?
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.100]   That's something families have to sit down
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.500]   and talk about, husbands and wives,
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.620]   especially before you have children.
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.020]   You need to start thinking through that, yes?
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.420]   You need to start discussing,
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.980]   where are going to be some of our top priorities
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.860]   that, because it's a priority,
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.100]   it might not be sinful, it might not be wrong,
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.780]   it might not be like, "Oh, if we do this,
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.140]   "we're going to be vile Christians."
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.300]   No.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.900]   We're just going to be all the more dedicated.
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:42.060]   And we're going to put our practice in.
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:45.340]   Instinctually, I believe most of us do this.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.260]   We do this questioning of prioritizing.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.940]   So by a quick way of review, the application builds.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.420]   The last application was this application of,
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:00.180]   we know Christ is the anchor, can you link to it?
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.500]   Is Christ as the anchor you desire,
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.900]   and you can describe that to your family?
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.260]   Does your vision for your family show a linkage to Christ?
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.420]   Here, in this second point, we're summarizing and saying,
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.780]   does the way you schedule your family life,
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.940]   does it show that you've tied yourself to Him?
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:22.380]   Does it show that you have linked yourself to the Lord?
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:27.620]   Now, I just want to give further motivation and oomph to that,
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.460]   because I'm going to be honest,
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.580]   the last several years of my life, I've been really busy.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.580]   And so there is this knee-jerk reaction in me.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.500]   Every time somebody says, "Hey, Pastor Mark,"
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.660]   or, "I see you're really busy, you've got to start prioritizing stuff,"
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:44.260]   automatically, my defense comes up, and I'm like,
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.900]   "You don't know how busy I am."
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.860]   "But I'm busy! I'm connecting!"
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.660]   And then there's this knee-jerk defensiveness that comes up
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.740]   that just wants to say, "I'm really, really busy."
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:33:00.700]   Now, I think what I need is a moment of humility to say,
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.700]   "Okay, I have to evaluate."
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.180]   Because the Scripture,
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.740]   like, the last study in the book of Colossians,
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.900]   so much of it is ringing in my head.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:14.940]   If you guys recall, in Colossians 1, verse 18,
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.700]   the Scripture said that Jesus Christ,
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.100]   He is the first, He is the Creator,
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:22.780]   everything is sustained through Him.
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.300]   And I'm going to read to you verse 18.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.140]   "He is the head of the body of the church,
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.500]   He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:37.620]   so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything."
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:41.220]   I've got to have the humility to sit there and say,
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.540]   "You know, I'm like your money.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.300]   I'm a pastor, so most of my activity
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.820]   has some kind of correlation to church and people.
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.340]   But is Jesus Christ having first preeminence in everything,
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.620]   especially my family?"
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:00.020]   That is a legitimate question to ask.
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.780]   And another way to kind of motivate you
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.940]   to make these priorities is this.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.220]   I think about the Pharisees a little bit,
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:12.300]   and how the Pharisees had a question of first place.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.300]   Think.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.460]   If you guys recall, it was the Pharisees.
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.500]   They were asking Jesus all these questions.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.500]   And then they were stumped, and then Sadducees was like,
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.500]   "Oh, what in the world?"
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.580]   They brought up a lawyer,
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.780]   and the lawyer was the one who asked Jesus,
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.980]   "What is the?"
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.620]   You guys remember?
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:30.620]   "The greatest of them."
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:34.540]   He was asking for what is the first priority in life.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.060]   What is the first thing God wants from us?
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.540]   That's very hypocritical.
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.220]   Why?
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:41.260]   Because they didn't care for that kind of stuff.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.260]   And Jesus answered,
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.900]   "You shall love the Lord your God," right?
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.420]   "With all your heart, with all your soul,
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.020]   and with all your mind."
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:54.020]   This is what I'm going to say as a point of conviction.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:58.900]   It is to our humbling and our implication to the Lord.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.220]   The vast majority of the time
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.860]   is that your priorities are automatically set
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.620]   by your personal principles and longings.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.620]   Meaning,
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.300]   let me try to make sense of what I'm saying.
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:18.300]   I believe that the Pharisees had an operating principle.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:20.060]   And what the operating principle
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:23.980]   was the operating principle that is most common in our day and age.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.740]   Have you guys heard the phrase,
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.420]   "You know, you got to do you."
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.420]   Have you guys heard that?
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.700]   I've heard that so many times.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.420]   And you know what else?
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.300]   Every time I talk,
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.940]   I listen to like a sports athlete
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.580]   who's talking and doing some kind of interview,
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.020]   you know what they typically say?
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.020]   They'll be like, "Oh yeah, you know,
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:45.100]   I just got to do what's best for me when I'm picking a team and doing all this stuff."
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.340]   I remember very distinctly,
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.420]   this was already 10 years ago,
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.900]   so sorry to bring an old analogy,
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.420]   but when LeBron was making his decision,
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.380]   he had a TV episode, right?
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.300]   He broadcasted the whole thing.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.860]   And in the middle, he looked all awkward,
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.740]   but then he realized,
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.940]   "Okay, this was kind of a bad idea."
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.180]   But if you guys remember what he said,
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.740]   he's like, "LeBron's got to do what's best for LeBron."
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.500]   He says LeBron.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.660]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.540]   It's so silly.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.300]   I believe that the Pharisees operated on the exact same principle.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:17.980]   "Pharisee's got to do what's best for Pharisee."
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.020]   Right?
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.180]   That was pretty much their sin.
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:21.900]   Why do I say that?
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.300]   You read Matthew chapter 23,
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.300]   and Jesus says, "You Pharisees,
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.220]   woe to you because you love the places of honor.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.940]   You love to sit atop and put people beneath you.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.700]   You love to make people do stuff,
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.580]   and you won't even pick up a finger.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.700]   You love this stuff where you're in power,
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.940]   and you look like you're on top,
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:44.180]   and that's why you're so judged.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:47.060]   Because you're always looking out for you.
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.580]   Your priorities are set," is my point.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.620]   We might sit there and be like,
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.100]   "Oh, no, what should I do first?"
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.460]   Actually, if we're honest,
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.180]   our priorities are typically already set by the principle,
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.860]   "I got to do what's best for me and my family."
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.260]   That is going to be, to us,
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.740]   one of the biggest challenges for our family.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.380]   If your dedication to Christ is that,
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.580]   "I first need to love him,
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.380]   and I'm satisfied with my family,"
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.580]   it might be inconvenience,
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.060]   but we love him.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.700]   When we say our vision is to serve him,
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.660]   and say, "I'm satisfied with my family and serving God,"
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.220]   even if that comes to a cost to my family,
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.100]   that should be when you feel like,
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.380]   "Things are good."
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:28.420]   But if your dedication is,
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.500]   "You know what, family got to do what's best for family,"
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.100]   you will struggle,
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.220]   because that is not the priority God's giving you.
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.540]   Amen?
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:41.300]   Now, my next point's going to be a little bit shorter.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.420]   When we set our priorities,
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.740]   that's how we end up deciding what to do next.
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.820]   And so, from our priorities,
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.140]   from our priorities,
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.540]   we have our activity.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.580]   And it builds, right?
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.060]   That the family that is anchored on Christ
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:00.060]   will have their activity tied to Christ.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.780]   And the way I'm going to describe it is this.
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.700]   Your actions, your activity,
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:07.180]   is essentially your values and desires plus opportunity.
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.340]   Okay?
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.940]   Your actions are essentially your values and desires
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.460]   plus opportunity.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.500]   Okay?
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.460]   Now, there's a classic concern,
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.060]   or a classic,
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.620]   I don't want to call it complaint,
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.020]   between ladies and men,
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.540]   especially in romantic relationships, right?
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.860]   There's been a classic scenario
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.460]   where the lady asks the guy to do something.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.300]   "Can you do this?"
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.580]   And the guy just completely and blitterly forgets.
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.220]   "I'm sorry, I forgot to do it."
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:32.900]   Right?
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.220]   And the lady looks at the guy and goes,
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:37.180]   "You didn't do it because you didn't care!"
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.620]   Right? "You don't want to!"
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:39.460]   Okay?
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.780]   Ladies, I'm just going to confess,
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.260]   that's like 90% of the time, right?
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.180]   We still need convincing that that's a worthwhile doing.
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.660]   We still need convincing that it's important, okay?
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.860]   But it's not always the case.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.980]   It's not always, okay?
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.780]   It's not always.
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.580]   Majority of the time, yes, but not always.
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.660]   Sometimes we genuinely lack the opportunity.
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.220]   Sometimes we're just genuinely busy,
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.660]   we don't have the know-how,
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.180]   we just don't know how to do it, right?
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.540]   We don't have the time, whatever it may be,
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.300]   we don't have the resources.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.820]   I would like this last point to be
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.980]   like a motivation for all of us.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.300]   Because what I'm saying right now,
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.900]   in terms of your identity, in terms of your priority,
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.140]   is not novel, new things that you've heard.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.980]   But it's things that I just want to encourage you
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.340]   to evaluate in your family life.
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.900]   And to revisit and do the work of maintaining, right?
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.500]   Taking these change and making sure
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.340]   that you sand off the rust.
[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:29.540]   That you protect it.
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.980]   That you make sure it's solid.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.980]   That there's no kinks in the chain,
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.620]   no neither is any break.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.660]   But when we think about this then,
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.660]   we're talking about our activity
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.340]   and it has to flow this way.
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.860]   And as we think about this, that our desire,
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:50.420]   I'm going to assume your desires are there, right?
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.900]   We're not making like a classic male excuse of like,
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.340]   you know, "Ah, you just asked me to do stuff
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.620]   "I don't want to do," you know?
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.580]   No, I'm just going to assume all of us,
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.740]   we want to more so fulfill the desire of God,
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.020]   the will of God in our families.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.580]   But sometimes all we're doing
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.940]   is waiting for the opportunity.
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.380]   We're waiting for like,
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:14.140]   how come the church didn't put together
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.340]   this one program where we all get together
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.660]   and then we all do family worship at home?
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:22.660]   Because the expectation is you would do it, right?
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.100]   That you would make your own opportunity.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.580]   I can't make the opportunity for you in your home.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.620]   How come we don't have this program
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.420]   where we all take rotations to come and serve at church?
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.500]   I can't make that opportunity for you all the time.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.180]   When I say I, I'm not saying like,
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.940]   "Oh, I'm going to structure this whole thing for you."
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.300]   Nobody can.
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:47.260]   Those opportunities, you have to search out.
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.500]   You have to make them.
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.900]   So I want to have a little bit of a motivation time
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.260]   and application saying,
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.620]   we have to move forward to say
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.580]   that we're never going to necessarily
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.620]   teach our children through osmosis.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.820]   Just like Pastor Peter Chung said,
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.460]   it doesn't necessarily happen,
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.020]   but because the parents are godly,
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.260]   it just naturally flows over
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.700]   and the light shining from God into us
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.980]   hits our children as it goes down, right?
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.340]   It just doesn't happen that way.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.620]   Nobody drifts into good husbanding.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:20.620]   Nobody drifts into good life goals.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:24.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.980]   We have to make sure that we make those opportunities.
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.060]   Many times when I talk to people and say,
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.620]   "Oh yeah, me and the wife,
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.740]   "we need to sit down and talk about these things."
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.300]   We just didn't have a chance.
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:40.020]   These are the moments when we have to hear the explanation.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.060]   The desire is there.
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:44.300]   You have to bring the opportunity, yes?
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.380]   You have to bring that opportunity.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.740]   What is keeping you?
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.100]   If honestly, like let's say,
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.220]   we're being honest,
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.100]   if you notice I'm trying to cut down
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.860]   the various excuses we give.
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.140]   Especially let's say when it comes down to
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.620]   like home worship, family worship.
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.180]   In your own house.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.220]   Is it a necessity that you do family worship
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.540]   every single day of your lives together?
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.140]   No, the Bible doesn't say,
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.060]   "Thou shalt have seven p.m. dinner
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.580]   "and eight p.m. family worship."
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:19.500]   The Bible does give a great, great pattern, example,
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.620]   that the husband teaches.
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.300]   That the husband leads the family in thinking about God,
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:27.020]   worshiping him and saying, "Thank you for all this."
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.180]   Right?
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.580]   It's a pattern.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.140]   And for the most, most of the time,
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.260]   it's not for a lack of like,
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.940]   do you think it's a good idea to do it?
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.500]   No one's gonna sit here and be like,
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.340]   "Nah."
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.180]   You know what?
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.380]   "That's not a good idea."
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.860]   It's because we're afraid.
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.700]   You know what?
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:43.540]   We haven't done it.
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:44.700]   It's gonna be ultra awkward.
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.980]   Right?
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.940]   Like I'm gonna be 100% honest.
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.740]   When I first got married,
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:50.580]   I was thinking like,
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.340]   "Yeah, we should have some family time worship."
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.100]   My wife is very discerning.
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.940]   She knows the scriptures well.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.820]   At the time, you know, I'm gonna read a passage,
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.860]   she's gonna be like, "What?"
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.980]   You know, like, "Are you sure about that?"
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.980]   You know, like, "I don't know."
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.620]   I was very, very like insecure in my own ability
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.340]   to speak on the matter.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.900]   You know, that kind of thing.
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:11.540]   So most of the time, we're not doing it
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:13.300]   because of fear of awkwardness
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.700]   or fear of like,
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:15.540]   or if I'm wrong.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.620]   What if I teach stuff that's just not kosher?
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:19.460]   Right?
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:22.620]   We have to make sure
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.020]   more of those things are more honestly done.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.980]   That's not for lack of opportunity, is it?
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.180]   It's not for lack of opportunity.
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.620]   So today, we're talking about action,
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:34.860]   we're talking about priority,
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.500]   we're talking about identity.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.260]   And I wanna give a challenge.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.100]   The scripture does not say,
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:42.060]   "Thou shalt do family worship."
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:45.660]   But very clearly, the home is a centerpiece
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.740]   of giving God honor
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.460]   by collectively thinking about His truth
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.700]   and rendering thanks to the Lord.
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.060]   Yes?
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.780]   We want those things to be a regular part,
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:01.420]   a regular part of our growing maturity in faith.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.500]   And what I'd like to do,
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.300]   by way of starting to wrap things up,
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.100]   is go to Hebrews chapter 12,
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.540]   because if there is a passage that talks about,
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.380]   "Let's move your identity,
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.980]   "let's move your priority,
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.100]   "all into action,"
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.340]   Hebrews chapter 12 is like,
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.340]   "Whoa, you better do it!"
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.020]   So let's go there.
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.180]   If there was, you know,
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.380]   Hebrews is an amazing book
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.820]   because it challenges so many individuals who are driven,
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.820]   whether because of the worries of persecution
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.220]   or just because of false teaching
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:36.380]   or just because of their individual lack of growth.
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.660]   Look at Hebrews' challenges against it,
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.220]   and within a very exhortational section,
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.220]   chapter 12, this is what he says,
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.340]   "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.540]   "of witness surrounding us,
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:50.260]   "let us also lay aside every encumbrance and sin
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.480]   "which so easily entangles us.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.860]   "Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.660]   "fixing our eyes on Jesus,
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:59.580]   "the author and perfecter of faith,
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.180]   "who for the joy set before him,
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.540]   "endured the cross,
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:04.100]   "despising the shame,
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:07.500]   "and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.660]   "For consider him who has endured such hostility
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.500]   "by sinners against himself,
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.120]   "so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.420]   "If there was ever a moment
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:19.100]   "you were tempted to give excuse,
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.620]   "'Oh, God, this is gonna be awkward.
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.060]   "'Oh, God, this is gonna be weird.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.700]   "'Oh, God, people are gonna point the finger.
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.260]   "'Oh, God, I don't know how.'"
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.600]   This portion says, "Look at Jesus.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.460]   "He has overcome every single one
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.720]   "of those possible scenarios and possible excuses,
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.100]   "overcoming the shame, enduring the cross.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.740]   "He's despising all of that.
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.380]   "He has accomplished his purpose,
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.240]   "to honor the Father.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.580]   "Jesus did it."
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:48.180]   And then verse four is one of the most convicting passages
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.460]   when it comes to your application
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.380]   and putting things in practice.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.660]   Verse four, it says, "You have not yet resisted
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.500]   "to the point of shedding blood
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.020]   "in your striving against sin."
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:04.780]   We live in a generation where people are constantly,
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:08.820]   constantly seeking to be affirmed in their weakness.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:12.820]   We regularly say, "Oh, God, look at my pain
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.060]   "and look at my struggle,"
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:15.860]   and they seek validation.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.300]   And at any time, people say,
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.020]   "Oh, man, in those moments, you were weak.
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.140]   "Oh, how dare you?"
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:22.980]   Right?
[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.820]   But the reason why that is bad
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:27.460]   is because we lower God's expectation
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:30.020]   to the standard of our weakness.
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.820]   Here, the Scripture does not do that.
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:37.380]   It challenges us beyond what we think is capable
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:40.620]   and says, "You have not yet gone to that degree."
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:45.820]   Does this sound too offensive for us?
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.340]   Especially where it is very, very important
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.220]   to our family lives.
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.580]   You have not gone to that degree.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.020]   Verse five, we carry on, it says,
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.900]   "And you have forgotten the exhortation
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:57.940]   "which is addressed to you as such.
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:01.380]   "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:04.420]   "nor faint when you are reproved by Him.
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:07.420]   "For those whom the Lord loves, He disciplines,
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.300]   "and He scourges every son whom He receives."
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:13.540]   That, again, is all identity talk.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.580]   You're experiencing all of this stuff,
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.820]   the hardships, the need to grow,
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.580]   these moments of testing, the storms that may come.
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:22.140]   Why?
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.060]   Because God's guiding you like His child.
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:26.140]   Right?
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.420]   And as we look forward, it says,
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:29.460]   "It is for discipline that you endure.
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.660]   "God deals with you as with sons,
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:34.820]   "for what son is there whom his Father has not disciplined?
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.220]   "But if you are without discipline,
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.180]   "of which all have become partakers,
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.420]   "then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.540]   "Furthermore, we have earthly fathers to discipline us,
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.020]   "and we respect them.
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.740]   "Shall we not much rather be subject
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.660]   "to the Father of spirits and live?
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:50.940]   "For they disciplined us for a short time,
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.460]   "as seemed best to them.
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.660]   "But He disciplines us for our good,
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.500]   "so that we may share His holiness.
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.180]   "All discipline for a moment seems not to be joyful,
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:03.660]   "but sorrowful, yet to those who have been trained by it,
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:07.020]   "afterward, yield the peaceful fruit of righteousness.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.900]   "Therefore," look at this, verse 12,
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.740]   "straighten the hands that are weak,
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.940]   "and the knees that are feeble.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.140]   "Make straight paths for your feet,
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:18.780]   "so that the limb which is lame
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:22.500]   "may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed."
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:26.380]   I just wanna give a really, really strong
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:27.820]   encouragement and motivation.
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:33.660]   I believe one of the great, great opponents
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:38.460]   of good family life is going to be the regular business
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:41.660]   and you saying, "Goodness gracious, I am tired."
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.900]   And I wanna give an exhortation.
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:50.300]   God desires us not to simply concede to that and say,
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.100]   "Ha, yeah, if you live life, if you've gone through this,
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.580]   "you know how it is.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.460]   "This is the way."
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:57.860]   What am I saying?
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:01.780]   The great temptation is to just simply assume,
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:05.820]   although yes, God wants to strive for unity in our marriage,
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.700]   although God wants us to strive to be true, to be filled,
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:11.740]   although God wants us to be rejuvenated by joy,
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.100]   by strength.
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:14.660]   You look at your life, you're all tired,
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:16.460]   and you say, "You know what, though?
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.860]   "This is the way it is."
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:21.620]   The great, great enemy of Christian family
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:23.700]   is to look at the various things that go wrong
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.700]   and say, "You know what, though?
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:25.540]   "It's okay."
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:29.540]   The motivation and challenging thing
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.700]   I wanna say to you is this.
[00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:34.260]   When we talk about the activity,
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:39.260]   that God's plan for you is so much more than what it is now.
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.980]   And it's really a challenge and hesitation for us
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:47.580]   to not only accept that, but to make the opportunities,
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.660]   to make incremental steps as need be,
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.780]   and to pursue those things with all our heart.
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:57.140]   And so by way of conclusion, by way of conclusion,
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:00.340]   we know that there's various tides, temptations,
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.980]   not only fatigue, but worldly ambitions.
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.500]   Not only worldly ambitions,
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.900]   the little evil overlord in my heart
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.620]   that dictates the pattern of our living.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:11.740]   And we have to combat that.
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.540]   And although the temptation might be to look around
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:17.780]   and be like, "Whoa, everybody else is like this."
[00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:21.020]   We have to tie ourselves to Christ
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:22.540]   so that we are able to say,
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:26.580]   when the Scripture challenges and commands us to hold on,
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:28.820]   that I did.
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.260]   I saw God's purpose and vision for us,
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.540]   and I tied myself to it.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.820]   I saw the various priorities that Christ has set
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:39.540]   for the families, and I tied our family's schedule to that,
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.100]   and what's more, rather than conceding a week,
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.460]   I put into action the things
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.460]   that are important to the Lord.
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.580]   In this way, let's make sure
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:52.460]   that there is a clear, clear chain
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:54.260]   to the strong anchor that is Christ.
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.100]   Let's pray.
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:51:04.300]   Our God, there is so much more to say
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:08.540]   about how Christ should influence
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.900]   and dictate and guide our lives.
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:16.220]   And I pray, Father, Lord, that every single one of us
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:20.740]   will be on this path of walking together as a family
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:23.780]   according to the design and measure of Christ.
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.500]   I pray, Father, God,
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:31.180]   if any of us have thought like we've either grown this way
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.460]   or the kind of link and clear connection
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.460]   to Christ has been lost,
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.740]   may we truly desire, Father, Lord,
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.660]   to tie ourselves to you.
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:43.460]   God, if there be anything that we need to repent of,
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.380]   Lord, I pray you would convict us of the spirit
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:46.700]   to confess those things.
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:49.300]   And what's more, in humility,
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.740]   be open to the scrutiny of your word.
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:54.780]   And then, Father, God, with your spirit, empower us,
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.060]   truly, not by our own might,
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:58.940]   but by conviction of who you are,
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:00.860]   who you've made us to be,
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.580]   and to hear your call, help us to respond.
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.180]   And, Father, we just continue to pray
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:09.700]   that you would then all the more provide, Lord,
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.420]   the sustaining power necessary,
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:15.100]   and, God, that you would be our necessary supply
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.820]   to walk with you faithfully.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.060]   We thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, and we pray.
