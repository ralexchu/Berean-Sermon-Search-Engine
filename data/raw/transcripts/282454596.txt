[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.620]   Yesterday, after the opening ceremony,
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.340]   the koalas tried to bully the Marines.
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.100]   However, Kiwi prayed, and our god
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.700]   delivered them from the bullies by giving them boils.
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.220]   Ew.
[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.780]   Now, they will participate in our first event of day two,
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.860]   the pencil job.
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.540]   Let's give a round of applause as the contestants come on stage.
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.500]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.700]   As a special guest, Cassidy the chum
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.380]   will be the pencil holder of this event.
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.380]   Now, let's welcome the koalas.
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.780]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.260]   The koalas and the Marines.
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.220]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.700]   Now, let's give it up for the Scrantonians.
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.500]   [CHEERING]
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.460]   And the Pawnee.
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.660]   [CHEERING]
[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.460]   All right.
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.540]   Now, each team will go one at a time to touch that pencil.
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.220]   Ready?
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.260]   Koalas, on your mark, get set, go.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.740]   [CHEERING]
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.220]   And the Marines, let's go.
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.700]   [CHEERING]
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700]   And the Marines.
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.180]   [CHEERING]
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.180]   It's too easy.
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.180]   All right.
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.180]   And the last one.
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.180]   All right.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.180]   Now, the next round, Taz and Peter Chung
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.660]   will go on the magical chair that
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.180]   will make him so much taller.
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.180]   How will they be able to reach the pencil this time?
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.180]   Now, the koalas will go next.
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.660]   The final round.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.160]   Koalas.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   Koalas must try their best.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.660]   Send one representative.
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.660]   And they got it.
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.140]   [CHEERING]
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.620]   Woo!
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.100]   What a round.
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.100]   That's Marines.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.580]   We'll go for it.
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.060]   [CHEERING]
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:40.020]   Oh, no.
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.500]   And the Pawnee.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.980]   Oh, no.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.460]   All right.
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.940]   Now, the Pawnee will go.
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.180]   [CHEERING]
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.660]   Aw.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.140]   And the last one.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.140]   Oh, no.
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.140]   And with that, the Pawnee have been disqualified.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.620]   The koalas have won.
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.100]   [CHEERING]
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.100]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.100]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.580]   [CHEERING]
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:36.860]   Looks like we won again.
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.460]   We're the winners.
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.180]   It's because we're so strong.
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.680]   Look at us.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.780]   We're so strong.
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.100]   We're the best.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.620]   We are the best.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.380]   We're not like that loser over there.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.980]   Look at that loser.
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.020]   Check it out.
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.500]   Excuse me.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.780]   Can you hold this microphone, please?
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.420]   Loser.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.220]   Loser?
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.720]   Loser.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.820]   Hey.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.700]   Hey, are you OK?
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.100]   Yeah, I'm fine.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.700]   I'm chill, you know.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.700]   No, I'm not.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.200]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.580]   Everything hurts.
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.700]   And I'm always in pain.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.700]   Sansan, can you remind me every 30 seconds
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.740]   that everything will be OK?
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.540]   Everything will be OK.
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.940]   OK.
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.260]   Well, I know you guys are out, but our god
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.020]   wins over everything.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.740]   Yeah, yesterday in class, we learned
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.580]   that god comes in first.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.380]   We can't idolize him or other idols before.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.180]   Everything will be OK.
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.140]   But whenever I'm feeling bad, I listen to my favorite idol,
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.300]   Lil Sebastian.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.860]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.460]   She's so dreamy.
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.940]   And whenever I listen to him, I feel so much better.
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.580]   Everything will be OK.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.620]   I think it's OK to listen to Lil Sebastian sometimes,
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.780]   but it's not good to idolize him.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.060]   We need to put god first.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.860]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.060]   Well, whenever I listen to Lil Sebastian,
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.300]   I feel so much better.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.860]   Should I praise god first, or should I
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.340]   put idols in front of him?
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.300]   I mean, the veil of pain didn't really do much.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.300]   Maybe god had me lose for a reason.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.780]   Do you want me to pray for you?
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.280]   I want to--
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.860]   Dear god, please watch over our friend, Milk,
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.180]   and give her hope in these tough times.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.100]   Assure her that you are always first.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.820]   In Jesus' name, I pray.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.620]   Amen.
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.500]   Wow.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   Thanks to you, you beautiful tropical fish.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.380]   Thanks for always being there for me.
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.100]   You know what?
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.660]   You're right.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.340]   I haven't been putting god first as my first priority.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.220]   Can you teach me more about god's word?
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.420]   Yeah, me too.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.300]   Everything will be OK when you put god first.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:47.620]   As Milk had hope in god's word, the Bereans
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.180]   shared god's words in Acts chapter 17 11 times.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.340]   They read the Bible and decided to go sign up
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.740]   for the Berean all church retreat on August 3
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.980]   to the 5th at Palm Springs.
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.440]   The weather is projected at 107 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit,
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.580]   so make sure to wear sunscreen every hour.
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.900]   Meanwhile, the evil Koalas plotted their plan
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.180]   against the Bereans to win the Olympics.
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.660]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.620]   [CHEERING]
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:32.500]   I'm so evil.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.900]   We're so evil.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.780]   Yeah, we're so strong.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.020]   We're so strong.
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.300]   No, I'm strong.
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.140]   Hey, I said we're so strong.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.820]   OK, maybe we're strong.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.020]   Those Bereans would never know it if tomorrow we're
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.460]   going to do something so evil.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.940]   [EVIL LAUGH]
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.700]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:20.700]   Strong, faster, love, and live, stand, and fall,
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:27.180]   and fight, and raise up, strong, faster.
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:33.140]   The sting of the whip on my shoulder,
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:39.620]   with the salt of my sweat on my brow.
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:46.100]   And oh, King of mine, can you hear your people cry?
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:52.980]   At last now, this is our power.
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:58.460]   Deliver us, deliver all, deliver us,
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:05.940]   for the Lord remember us in His burning hand.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:12.420]   Deliver us, better than you promised us.
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.900]   Deliver us to the promised land.
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:23.860]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.860]   And so, although Swansong and Noah from Pond
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.460]   are now out of the race, they found
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.820]   that God has bigger and better plans for them.
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.660]   Noah learned to worship God and not idolize
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.940]   little Sebastian while they prepared for the all-church
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.420]   retreat next month.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.900]   Find out what happens next tomorrow at the first Korean
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.100]   Summer Olympics 2018.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.460]   [APPLAUSE]
