[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800]   Hello everyone at Berean Community Church and online viewers. My name is Joshua Chun.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.840]   I've been a member at Berean Community Church for two years. I first attended in 2014 during
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.000]   my extended breaks from school. I've been regularly attending since 2017. Yeah, this
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.600]   is my testimony. Okay. So before receiving Christ, I knew God only as a merciful God.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.360]   I pictured him as an old grandfather ready to see me whenever I please with forgiveness
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.420]   in his hand. Although this is true, that God, although it is true that God does have mercy
[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.560]   and forgiveness for me, the single faceted view of God led me to abuse the love and grace
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.400]   that he has given me. The Bible says that God is King and Lord, but my actions never
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.800]   reflected that truth. Born and raised in the church, I learned what the gospel was at a
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.800]   young age. Soon after, I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior and was sprinkle baptized
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.800]   in middle school. Reflecting back on my baptism and life after baptism, I didn't truly understand
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.460]   the Lord part of my confession. I still kept forging my own path, doing as I pleased and
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.520]   attached Jesus to my goals to keep them aligned with his will. My view of God was small and
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.440]   wrong. He is so much more than just the one I pray for to relieve my guilty conscience.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.920]   I always wanted a miraculous moment, a feeling of enlightenment, an aha moment where all
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.200]   of a sudden I know God and I knew his will, but that wasn't the case. Like many of you,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.400]   it was just a gradual growth in the faith. With the help of older brothers and the community
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.600]   around me, and of course the Holy Spirit, God has revealed so much more than just his
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.940]   mercy. The holiness of God, his sovereignty, and his Lordship have changed my faith greatly.
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.620]   About three to four years ago, I understood and accepted the kingship part and all the
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.980]   groundwork that had been laid in my life was solidified. As it says in Philippians 1.6,
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.540]   for I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in me, or in you,
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.100]   will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus. I'm still not perfect, far from it, but I
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.740]   have faith that God will lead me the entire way. After receiving Christ, my view of God
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:55.100]   and also myself has been transformed. The chasm between God and man is no longer great,
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.420]   but impossible. A sinful man can only come before a thrice holy God by the death and
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.900]   resurrection of Christ Jesus. I have no means of my own to be washed clean of the filth
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:17.660]   we call sin. Reading from Ephesians 1.13, and you were included in Christ when you heard
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.900]   the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.120]   with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit. It is such a big burden lifted off my shoulders
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.700]   knowing that there is nothing that I could do to make it into heaven. That it is an impossible
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:49.300]   feat not attainable by anyone here, or anyone, but only by the grace of God through Jesus
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:56.020]   Christ. And by that grace I stand here today, a reborn man. Or at least I will be after
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:03.820]   I get into the law. So God is King, and we are his bond slaves, but there is no place
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.660]   I'd rather be than in his courts. We serve a good King, the only King. To know him and
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.340]   do his bidding is the greatest gift of grace that we could receive. Thank you.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.340]   [Applause]
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:37.340]   >> Doctor, you understand when you go into the water, you're united with Christ in his
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.340]   death, and then when you're coming out, you're uniting with his resurrected life?
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.340]   >> Yes, I do.
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.340]   >> I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.340]   >> Amen.
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.340]   [Applause]
