[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   [Music]
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Hello everyone. Welcome again to Passion Week devotions.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   This is something we've been doing for years now.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   And Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday we've been giving these devotions to help us see how Jesus walked the last days before crucifixion.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Something I wanted to remind us of also is as we see how Jesus intentionally takes each of these days towards the cross,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   it causes us to feel and see the richness of what led to that death and what leads to the resurrection.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   And our hope is that we would all be able to feel and sense the depths of that so that even the depths of our worship would grow.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And today as we spend time going through this together, I hope we're also all very encouraged.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   I know someone I talked to recently said, "Oh man, it's so nice to be able to be here just on these days of the week.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   It's nice to be together to worship even though it's just a short hour."
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   And in that, it would encourage us and spur us on towards greater worship of Christ.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   After our prayer set here, we're going to be having our brother Mark come up to give his testimony of how he became a saved person.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And after that, we'll be going into a silent Wednesday.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Let me go ahead and pray for us.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Heavenly Father, we come here,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   God, remembering that though perhaps we've thought of your march, of Jesus' march to the cross time and time again,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Lord, that this is a fresh privilege and opportunity.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   God, to remember anew what it is that Christ did to purchase salvation for us.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   God, he didn't just die.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   There was so much he had to endure.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   So much that our Lord and Savior had to go through.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   And Father, we don't want to take this flippantly.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   We want to remember him.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   God, we want to thank you for each of these days, for each story we go into, for each account in these Gospels.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   God, we want to remember it and never forget it.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   We do not want the Gospel to grow stale in our lives.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   And so Lord, tonight we come in humble adoration, but also in humble submission.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Lord, coming with empty hands, asking you, Father, to break our hearts.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Remind us, Lord.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Remind us of what you did.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Let it be fresh to us.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   And Lord, let it cause in us a huge worship towards a huge God.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Can we all stand for a time of worship?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Amen.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   [Music]
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Though the nations rage, kingdoms rise and fall,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   There is still one King reigning over all.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   So I will not fear, for this truth remains,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   That my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   None above Him, none before Him, all of time in His hand.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   For His throne it shall remain and ever stand.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Though the dread of night overwhelms my soul,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   He is here with me.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   I am not alone, for His love is sure.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   And He knows my name, for my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   None above Him, none before Him, all of time in His hand.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   For His throne it shall remain and ever stand.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   [Music]
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Though I may not see what the future brings,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   I will watch and wait for the Savior King.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Then my joy complete, standing face to face
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   in the presence of the Ancient of Days.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   None above Him, none before Him, all of time in His hand.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   For His throne it shall remain and ever stand.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   [Music]
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   [Music]
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   All I once held dear, build my life upon.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   All this world reviews and wars to own.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   All I once stocked gain, I have counted lost.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Spent and worthless now compared to this.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Knowing you, Jesus, knowing you, there is no greater thing.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   You're my all, you're the best.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   You're my joy, my righteousness, and I love you more.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   [Music]
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Now my heart's desire is to know you more,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   to be found in you and known as yours.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Presence by faith what I could not earn,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   all surpassing gift of righteousness.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Knowing you, Jesus, knowing you,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   there is no greater thing.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   You're my all, you're the best.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   You're my joy, my righteousness, and I love you more.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   [Music]
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Oh, to know the power of your risen life
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   and to know you in your sufferings.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   To become like you in your death, my Lord.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Oh, with you to live and never die.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Knowing you, Jesus, knowing you,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   there is no greater thing.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   You're my all, you're the best.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   You're my joy, my righteousness, and I love you more.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Knowing you, Jesus, knowing you,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   there is no greater thing.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   You're my all, you're the best.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   You're my joy, my righteousness, and I love you more.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   [Music]
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   You may be seated.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   All right. Good evening, church family.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   My name is Mark Barlas. I'm married to Mel.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   We have two kids, Amelia and Jack.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   So I have the privilege of this evening of sharing my testimony,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   what God has done in my life and what he's doing as of late.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And so I've kind of broken up my testimony to hopefully help you guys follow along.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   And in retrospect, I actually was really blessed by going over it.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   It just reminds me of God's handiwork in my own life and what he continues to do.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And so I begin by presenting the questions that filled my mind throughout high school and college.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   What did I grow up believing? Is it truth? What is truth?
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   How come I never heard these things about God despite growing up in religious circles?
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And so my family, growing up, we practiced a type of Catholicism
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   that infused a lot of superstitious beliefs.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   One such superstition dealt with hand-me-down shoes and wallets
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   accompanied with cash in hopes that the recipient's wealth would multiply tenfold.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   So you can imagine how much money would come in shoes, for example.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   And these rituals were understood as, "We just do it because it's always been the way it is."
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   In addition to attending Catholic services, praying the rosary,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   confessing to a priest, and pursuing good deeds, followed that same logic.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   That's just how we did it.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   In them were the false promises of a happy, blessed life here on Earth
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   and a great life in eternity.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   This would be my paradigm leading up to college.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   I wish I could say I didn't fall into doing these things, or fail into doing these things, but I did.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Eventually, it all became a load too big to carry.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Constantly failing to live up to these standards calloused my worldview,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   cultivating, obviously, teenage rebellion.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   During middle school, high school period, I saw fractures in what, at that time, I called my faith.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Looking back, it was clear that it was man's approval I sought, not the Lord's.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Going to Sunday Mass, petitioning prayers to Jesus, Mary, and various saints
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   were soon exchanged with meeting new friends, hanging out, pursuing money, excelling in school, whatever else.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   I see this was a microcosm of what could have been my life today
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   had not the Lord saved me.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   At that time, my best life on Earth was my God.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   The deception was real because it was indoctrinated from the very beginning.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   Fast-forwarding to my junior year of high school is a period where I really first thought of God's word being planted or sown.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   To many, junior year, obviously, is a make-or-break year.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Academic excellence coupled with extracurricular activities was a surefire way to getting to great colleges.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   My late-night outings included studying libraries for PSATs, SATs, and whatever AP tests.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   If my friends and I were not studying, we were joining as many social clubs
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   in an effort to showcase to college recruiters our willingness to go above and beyond.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   There was one club I joined thinking this is great to have on my college application,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   and it wouldn't require too much other than regular attendance.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   My friends encouraged it, and so I went.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Lo and behold, it was a Christian club.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   I thought, "Well, I've been to church all my life. Why not?"
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   This club was evidence, when I look back, of God's providence.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   The club covered many topics such as Romans Road, the commandments, the fruits of the Spirit, among other things.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   It was my first time encountering these truths, despite me being confirmed in the Catholic Church that year.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   I met genuine God-fearing people that are still walking faithfully with the Lord today,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   and I'm still close friends and grateful for them.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   That same year, one of them invited me to a Bible study at a church called Maranatha Chapel in San Diego.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Their church was going through the book of Hosea, and man, I remember hearing God's Word.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   [PAUSE]
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   It was preached clearly and differently than what I was accustomed to.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   [PAUSE]
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   It was refreshing.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   [PAUSE]
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   A breath of new life?
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   [PAUSE]
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   And for the first time, I thought, "Wow, is this truth?
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   [SNIFFLES]
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   How is this different from what I grew up with?
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Isn't this the same?"
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Later on, I went home that evening, contemplating,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   and from what I recall, just faint whispers in my head concluded, "This is different."
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   I continued attending the Bible studies, curious where the study would lead.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And a few studies later, I bought a Bible.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   I went to a bookstore, just bought a Bible.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Thankfully, it was the right Bible, because I had no idea.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And I started reading.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   And I remember one of my closest friends mentioned Romans.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   I was like, "I don't know where it is," so I just started.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   And I can honestly say God's Word was planted.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   If I could use emojis back then, it would be the mind-blowing ones.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   [SNIFFLES]
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Because between Hosea and Romans, concepts of God's faithfulness,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   concepts of no one seeking God, concepts of sin, concepts of grace,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   all of this perplexed me, but it made sense, a paradox.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Despite my inconsistent attendance to Maranatha,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   every encounter with God's Word challenged and changed my worldview.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   I began learning more about who God is--
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   holy, righteous, faithful, gracious, merciful, loving, the list goes on.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   His Word exposed my sins of selfish ambition and man's approval.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Like an onion, the layers of my sin were being peeled back,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   revealing my core nature, sinful.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Yet I was not willing to surrender.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   So I wandered with a rebellious heart my first two years of college,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   thinking there was still a space to have what I wanted.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   I eventually entered UC Irvine as a junior
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   and reconnected with old friends and made new ones.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   These same friends eventually brought me here to Berean.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Faithful pastors and brothers here walked me through and back to the Word.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   It confirmed its validity patiently.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Books such as Philippians, Romans, Matthew, Ephesians
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   reiterated the insufficiency of my morality ambitions.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   These things did not save me but condemned me.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   I was a fool thinking I could have the world
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   and obtain eternal life based on my moral excellence.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   God really opened my eyes that year.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Emojis again.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   It was clear I was a sinner before a thrice holy God,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   deserving of His righteous judgment.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   For the first time I was scared but not.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   For the first time my heart and heart was being broken,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   but a new heart was taking shape.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Psalm 824 spoke truth that forever would change my life,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   but God being rich in mercy because of the great love with which He loved us,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   even when we were dead in our trespasses,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   made us alive together with Christ.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   And just a few verses down provided the clarity
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   that eventually I believed in.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   By grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   It is a gift of God, not as a result of works,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   so that no one may boast.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   It was clear, Christ alone, faith alone.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Just a few months later I confidently declared Jesus Christ
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   as my Lord and Savior and was baptized.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   The sweetness of understanding God's salvation plan
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   transformed me in ways where family and friends noticed immediately,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   asking what happened, why, are you sure?
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Some saying that this is just a phase, it will pass.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Well, it's been 15 years since that time.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Praise God that He remains.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   The author and perfecter of my faith.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   And since then, my family has been the one of the ministries
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   God's placed in my life.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Sorry.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   It's been challenging and heartbreaking on multiple fronts.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Obviously I can't share this evening,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   but in these moments of sanctification where I wrestle with surrender,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   discernment, obedience, God has faithfully pointed me back to His word,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   to who He is, His promises, His kingdom.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Back to the foot of the cross, humbled.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And something I've been meditating on, Philippians 2, 4, 7,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   and which I'll conclude with, rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Again, I will say rejoice.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Let your gentle spirit be known to all men.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   The Lord is near.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   The Lord is near.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Thank you.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   [applause]
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Thanks, Mark.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   There's proof that real men cry.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And I'm so thankful for Mark.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   He's one of our college staff.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   As he was going through that testimony,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   I realized there's so many people pouring into his life,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   into the entirety of it.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And now here he is pouring right back into our students as well.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   And I can't help but marvel.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   It's hard not to marvel, you know,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   that what Jesus did as we keep trekking with Him in this story
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   was not just some story 2,000 years ago,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   but it has present-day ramification for us every single day.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   That all of that was necessary for Mark to be saved,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   for me to be saved, and for all of us that call ourselves believers.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   I'm very thankful.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   May we read for us Luke 22, verses 1-6.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Luke 22, verses 1-6.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   [reading]
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Let's pray.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Lord, as we go into silent Wednesday this day,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   where there might not have been so much activity in the life of Christ as written,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Lord, we can see how much you move.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   And Father, as we see this on display,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   I pray, Lord, that as we can even remember every single one of our testimonies,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   God, that what Christ did on the way to that cross
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   was vital for us as individuals as well as a body.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   And Lord, we just sing a song that says
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   that knowing you, there is no other thing.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   We say, "You're my all. You're the best."
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   We say, "To live is Christ."
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   And so, God, I pray that our hearts would trek along with what we sing.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   God, that as we see Jesus on the way to this cross,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Lord, that we wouldn't be trying to fit that story into our lives.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   But Lord, that that would be the center.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   God, that we can see how our lives shed light on what he did there.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   That Jesus would be the center of every single one of us.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   And Father, that this story would shine.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Help us, Lord, because we are so self-centered a people.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   We need your grace in order to properly worship you tonight.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   On day one this past Sunday, Pastor Peter took us through Palm Sunday
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   where many were singing Hosanna.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   And I thought it was really powerful what Pastor Peter kind of ended with,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   that Jesus grieves.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   On day two this past Monday, Jesus cursed the fig tree.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   He cleared and cleansed the temple.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Yesterday on day three, Jesus pronounces the woes on the Jewish leaders
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   and he tells them to be aware of the future, to be ready for what's coming.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Today, this is day four, this is Wednesday.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   Wednesday in Scripture, some people call it Silent Wednesday
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   because the Gospels are relatively silent about Jesus' activity on this day.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   But something that we see is Judas.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Judas Iscariot, and he's very active.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   This is a day before the Passover.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   And the Passover meal, I'm really excited for that tomorrow.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   But I realized then we can't really go into what happened on Passover.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   I'm hoping one day we can actually do that for a devotion.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   But this is the day before the Last Supper when Jesus and the disciples
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   would sit down in front of the bread and the wine,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   and they would take of that together.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Now I want to read to you again what we just read in Luke 22
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   and to try your best to walk along with Jesus here,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   or the story of Jesus here that's unraveling.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Luke 22 verse 1, I'm going to read it again.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   "Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put him to death,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   for they were afraid of the people.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   And Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   belonging to the number of the twelve,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   and he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   how he might betray him to them."
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   And I want to focus in here on the parties that are involved.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   So either you can look down at the text, you can look up here,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   but look and see the detail that Luke is putting in.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   First, you see the religious leaders who are conspiring against Jesus to kill him.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   In verse 2, "The chief priests and the scribes were seeking."
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   That word "seeking" is pretty heavy.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   They were seeking, intentional, willful,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   trying to figure out how can we put this man to death.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   But secondly, we see also Satan at work here, who enters into Judas.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Satan's been at work since the beginning.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Satan's been at work trying to figure out how to prevent the Messiah from coming,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   and when the Messiah comes into the picture, how to crush him.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   But thirdly, and perhaps most heartbreaking, in verse 3,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   "And Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot."
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Judas Iscariot was conspiring to have Jesus killed.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Now there's so much intention.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   If there's any word that I'd like us to take away tonight is "intention,"
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   because I think that's what Luke is describing.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   He's describing intention.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   That the chief priests and the scribes were being intentional and willful.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   Satan was being intentional and willful.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Judas was being intentional and willful.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   In fact, Luke is very careful here to mention that Judas belongs to the twelve.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   You see that? Belonging to the number of the twelve.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Why would he mention a fact like that?
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   To emphasize the fact that Judas was a part of Jesus' inner circle.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Judas intentionally, willfully, even as one who's been walking with Jesus these last three years,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   he goes to the chief priests and officers and discusses with those men
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   who are trying to intentionally kill Jesus, how he might betray Jesus to them.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   This is planned and thought out action.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   In the account of Matthew, it records Judas' actual words to these leaders.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Let's look at it. Matthew 26, verse 15.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   I mean, this is so malicious.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   He goes up to the chief priests and scribes and he says,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   "What are you willing to give me to betray him to you?"
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Isn't this so heartbreaking?
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   He goes to them and he says, "What will you give me for me to betray him so that you can kill him?"
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Wow.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   We learn in this account of Matthew that 30 pieces of silver is all it took.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   30 pieces of silver.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Some people say that 30 pieces of silver was what it costed to purchase a slave.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   It's shocking that someone so close to Jesus, someone who walked with Jesus,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   who saw Jesus' works and miracles, he was in the inner circle.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   He was as close as you could get to Jesus.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   He witnessed his power firsthand.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   He saw Jesus' grace and compassion and mercy upon people.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   He saw Jesus' power.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   He saw Jesus cast out demons and rebuke disease.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   And he actively goes and betrays his Lord.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   Satan enters, yes, but this is still him.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   This was still the responsibility and action of this man, Judas.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   Judas doesn't just give in to a moment of weakness.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   He calculates, and after hearing everything it is to enter into the kingdom,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   after witnessing all it is that the Holy Spirit was at work,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Judas becomes the one to knock that very first domino down,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   and he paves the way for sinful man to nail Jesus to the cross and crucifixion.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Now, I want to remind us of last night.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   Judas just heard.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   He just heard Jesus pronounce these woes and rebukes upon the leaders of Israel, right?
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   And he said, "Hypocrites!"
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   It was a damning preaching.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   It was fiery and powerful.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   He says, "These men will not enter the kingdom of God."
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   He heard it.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   And yet, Judas goes right to those leaders on this day.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Wow.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   It's amazing that Judas doesn't hear.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   It's amazing that in that place his heart had become so hardened
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   that he wouldn't fall in repentance and turn away.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   He actually doubled down.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   That's how sin works.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   This is what we see in him.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Now, though there's not action in regards to Jesus,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   what I do want to take a moment is to see what might have been going on in the mind of Jesus on this day.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   This is, remember, the last week Jesus walks this earth.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Before, it's not just death.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   It's so much more, isn't it?
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Before he faces the wrath of God, an eternal wrath of God.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   I mean, this is--have you ever been so anxious about something?
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   Like so anxious about something?
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   Like what happens to your concentration?
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   It consumes you, doesn't it?
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   When you're so scared of a test coming up,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   or you're so scared of something that you're going to have to do,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   or you're so scared of this thing that's looming, it consumes you.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   You can't sleep.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   You're just thinking about it all the time.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Things might be going on all around you.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   People are walking around all around you.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   You can't think about them.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   You are so consumed.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   This is the last week of Jesus before he takes the cup of wrath.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   What was going on in the mind of Jesus?
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   I mean, what must have it been like for Jesus to know that betrayal,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   this betrayal that was to come towards him,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   not just from Judas but from all sinners.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   What must have been like as Jesus was seeing this happen all around him,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   that yet he was going to take the sin of all of the hostility
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   that was coming out from these people.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   I sometimes wonder what it must have been like for Jesus,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   who is the holy God,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   to walk amongst these people,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   to not only be pronouncing woes to the scribes and Pharisees over there
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   who are trying to kill him,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   but even in his inner circle to see vile, depraved sin at work.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   That it wasn't just far, it was near.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   What must it have been like for Jesus to see that this sin was just so pervasive?
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   And he was just seeing all of this going around.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   That it was Judas, that it was these people,
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   that it was Satan, everything.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   I mean, Jesus doesn't use this last week to think about himself.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   He doesn't use this last week to realize what's going on
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   and the sin that's going on all around him.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   He knows what's happening.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   He feels it.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   There is nothing good around him.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   He is the only holy one who is walking around.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   The entire planet.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Everything else is broken.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   Everything else is vile.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Everything else is fallen.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   It's just filth all around him.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   And he is walking around thinking of others.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   He must have known what Judas was doing on that day.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   And he took no action to protect himself.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   He took no action to become inward or to cloister or to think that this is a time I can just go
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   and see if I can be selfish here.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   In fact, again, I can't go too much into this because this is tomorrow.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   This is the Passover meal.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   But the very next day, during the Passover meal, Jesus washes the disciples' feet.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Including Judas's.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   What must have it been like for the holy God, the only holy one,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   with vile and righteousness and depravity all around him,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   to kneel down and wash the filthy feet of filthy sinners?
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   What must have it been like for him to go in front of Judas, the one who was to betray him,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   and do the same?
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   I think this account reminds us of a couple of things.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   First, there is threat.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   There is a lot of fear to be had in this story.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Because I think we need to take care of where we stand.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Because what we see in Judas here is that nearness to Christ,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   and nearness to the things of Christ, does not guarantee that you know Christ.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   It does not guarantee our salvation, let alone our devotion.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   It shows us that we need to take stock of our own lives and evaluate our hearts,
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   and see where there is not only a heart of unbelief,
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   but perhaps even what we see in Judas, a purposeful rebellion.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   A purposeful resistance, and even hatred against God.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   As we all have a bit of this Judas inside of us.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   And some sitting amongst us are Matthew 7, 21 people,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   who will one day come before God as Judas perhaps might have.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   Perhaps Judas heard these words.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   Perhaps these were his last-ditch things, even though he knew.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   He comes and he said, "But maybe, even though I betrayed Jesus,
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   that I would come before God and say, 'But didn't I do all these things in His name?
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   Didn't I do all these things in Your name, Jesus?
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   I know, but does Your cross, does Your blood, does Your grace not cover over all sin?
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   Didn't I do all those things?'"
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   And Jesus would have stared at Judas and said, "I never knew you,
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   but there are those who are sitting amongst us that perhaps would sit in the same place.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   So we ought to take care of where we stand."
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   But I think in this story there's also good news
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   because Judas' story has closed, but ours are still open.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   You still have opportunity today to turn and to repent.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   You don't need to meet the same end as Judas.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   And this week is all about, I hope you have the opportunity every single night this week
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   to repent and turn to the Lord because that's what we see in this story.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   Secondly, there's hope and grace and love in this story.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   We ought to remember how great the love of Christ was in His sacrifice on the cross.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   No one was with Him.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   Remember, these religious leaders were against Him.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   And by the end, the people were shouting out and screaming out, "Crucify Him."
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   They were even desiring Jesus to die over a high-profile murderer.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   His disciples had scattered, deserting Him in the time of His greatest need.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   And most terrifying of all, the Father Himself unleashed all the pent-up fury and wrath over sin.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   What we see in the midst of the only Holy One who is walking around all these vile, wretched sinners,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   even to the point where everyone is not just vile and wretched and living out their own lives,
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   but breathing hostility against this Jesus, that they might crucify Him,
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   that we see the love and the grace that might enact in us hope.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   Jesus didn't die for good people.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   He died for the wretched.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   And if we are believers, we are numbered amongst these.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   I want to turn our attention to John 13, verse 1.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   And this is the John take on what was going on with Judas.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   Because right after this, we see what he says about Judas.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   In John 13, verse 1, it says, "Now before the feast of the Passover,
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   Jesus, knowing that His hour had come, that He would depart out of this world to the Father,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end."
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Again, please, please look carefully.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   Please don't let these words just go past.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   I know sometimes we have a tendency to look at Scripture,
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   and then you wait for what the preacher has to say about it.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   Look at the words. It says, "Jesus, knowing that His hour had come,
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   that He would depart out of this world to the Father,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end."
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   It shows us the heart of Jesus, which is just crazy to me.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   That as He's walking around, as much as we see the vileness and the wretchedness
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   of the sinners that are walking all around Him,
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   that Jesus was filled with a heart of love.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   It's a story about Judas and these chief scribes and these Pharisees,
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   these religious leaders, perhaps about Satan who's at work.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   But what we see in this story is actually to paint for us,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   not a picture of us looking at the story and being like, "Man, they're pretty bad."
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   This story is actually supposed to show us in this narrative of Christ
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   who's walking towards the cross that we are numbered amongst them.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   That we are just as depraved, that we are just as vile,
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   and that we were the ones who actually, actively wanted Christ crucified.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   That as intentional, as willful as they were, that so were we.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   This is our story. This is us wanting Jesus dead.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   And so this is Jesus' love for us in the midst of this.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   On Silent Wednesday, as the entire world was working in conjunction to kill the Lord,
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   we can really see how great sin is and how much greater is the love of God.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   There is no good in us. There is nothing good in us.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   So I want to lastly go into this text, which I don't have up here,
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   but would you turn with me to Romans 3?
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   [Pause]
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Chapter 3, verse 10.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   [Pause]
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   "As it is written, 'There is none righteous, not even one.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   There is none who understands, there is none who seeks for God.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   All have turned aside, together they have become useless.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   There is none who does good, there is not even one.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   Their throat is an open grave, with their tongues they keep deceiving.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   The poison of asps is under their lips, whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   Their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and misery are in their paths.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   And the path of peace they have not known. There is no fear of God before their eyes."
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law,
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in His sight,
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   And this describes not only Judas, this describes not only the religious leaders,
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   this describes every single one of us.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   We are counted amongst the mockers.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   But verse 21, as we look at the cross,
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   "But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested,
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   being witnessed by the law and the prophets.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   For there is no distinction, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus."
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   Would you take a moment to bow your heads and pray?
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   I feel like there's a few things that need to happen.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   One thing is we need to see the story of Christ and see everything that is going on.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   Secondly, that I need to shed light on who we are before Him.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   And for us as believers, our hearts beat along with this.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   And I'd like us to pray for maybe two things.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   One thing, would you pray that God would show us again the vileness and wretchedness of our sin
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   before Him, our holy God?
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   And that counts even to our sin today.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   Wherever you may stand, whatever it is that you have been fighting with or struggling with
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   or even giving into, that God would show us the vileness as we've seen the story of Judas,
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   that this is crucifixion.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   Secondly, I pray that we would see the gospel.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   And would you pray this as well, that God would show us beauty,
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   that God would show us individually what it is to marvel, to respond in worship,
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   to say thank you, and to not just look at our sin and hate the sin,
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   but to look to Christ and see our true desire,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   to want Him more than anything else,
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   to see all other things fade as shadows.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   Because though Jesus was silent on this day,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   we can feel His intention in light of the sinner.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   [music]
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   [music]
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   [music]
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   [music]

[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.500]   (soft instrumental music)
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.000]   (soft instrumental music)
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   (soft instrumental music)
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   (soft instrumental music)
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   (soft instrumental music)
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.500]   (soft instrumental music)
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:53.500]   (soft instrumental music)
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:02:03.500]   (soft instrumental music)
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:10.500]   (soft instrumental music)
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:14.000]   (soft instrumental music)
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   (soft instrumental music)
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   (soft instrumental music)
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   (soft instrumental music)
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.500]   - Heavenly Father, perhaps there's so much more prayer
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.500]   that needs to be had,
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   but God, we wanna thank you even for the moment, Lord,
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   where we can see the story of Jesus on his way to the cross.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.500]   And Father, I pray that you would help us to see beauty
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:55.000]   amidst the depravity.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   Help us, God, to see that there is only one good
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.500]   amongst the myriads of fallenness and brokenness.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.000]   That we might not look to other things to cling to,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   but that there is only one that we can cling to.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.500]   The only one unshaking good in our lives, our Christ.
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:22.500]   Oh, Father, there is no other name under heaven
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.000]   by which we're saved.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   He's all we have.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.500]   He is our only hope.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:33.500]   And so, God, I wanna thank you
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.000]   'cause even in a testimony shared earlier today,
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.500]   we see tears of joy as we remember what you did.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:47.500]   And God, I pray that for each one of us this week,
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.000]   we would remember what you did.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   That this story is not 2,000 years ago.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.500]   This story is mine, and it's now.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.500]   Because it's about my Christ,
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.500]   and it's about the one I love.
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.500]   It's the one who gave his life for me.
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:08.000]   So thank you, Lord, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.500]   - For our closing praise.

[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   as unchanged people.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   But God, that we would be resolved
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   and be filled with conviction, Lord, to respond.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.000]   And as we walk out those doors, God, please,
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   let us be moved into transformation and change.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   That we might desire more of Christ.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   And that we will want nothing but Christ.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.500]   So thank you, Lord, for this week.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   Okay, well thank you for coming.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   Again, tomorrow it's gonna be Passover meal,
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   but the logistics team did ask for some help.
