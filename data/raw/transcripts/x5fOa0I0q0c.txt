[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.220]   We have some announcements.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.220]   New Year's Eve service is this Tuesday at 11 p.m.,
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.220]   so please come and join us for that.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.220]   Prepare your hearts.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.220]   Come with a heart that's ready to reflect on the year.
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.220]   And then we have a Jubilee Fellowship Lunch
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.220]   in a couple Sundays on January 12th at 1 p.m.
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.220]   in the Youth Chapel across the courtyard there.
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.220]   It's going to be $10 for adults,
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.220]   $5 for children above 10.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.220]   And then in three weeks,
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.220]   we have Berean membership class starting.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.220]   That's an eight-week course.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.220]   And so if you want to know a little bit more
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.220]   about what we believe here at Berean,
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.220]   if you would like to become a member,
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.220]   you have to go to all eight of these courses.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.220]   And so please sign up for that.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.220]   The QR codes are there for you.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.220]   And on that same day, we also have a members meeting.
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.220]   So if you are a member of the church,
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.220]   please come to that.
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.220]   It is something that we require four times a year.
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.220]   And so it's 2 p.m. in the main sanctuary right here.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.220]   In between, there's going to be a fundraiser lunch,
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.220]   so just kind of keep that in mind
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.220]   instead of just kind of going off and eating on your own.
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.220]   And then lastly, BAM Retreat.
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.220]   There's only a little bit of time left now
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.220]   before the sign-ups will close here.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.220]   So if you can come to that,
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.220]   if you're a part of the BAM ministry,
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.220]   please make sure to highlight that.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.220]   That's one of the bigger events of the year.
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.220]   Friday, January 31st to Sunday, February 2nd.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.220]   Today, after worship,
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.220]   we're going to be spending some time
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.220]   watching our brother Lawrence get baptized.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.220]   If you have offering,
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.220]   we have an offering basket back there,
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.220]   or you can give electronically.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.220]   Would you bow your heads with me in prayer?
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:03.220]   Heavenly Father, we pray, God,
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:08.220]   that you would really take offering from us
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.220]   in a way that brings honor to you.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.220]   Lord, that is so contingent on us,
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.220]   understanding and recognizing who you are,
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.220]   what you've done,
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.220]   and God, the reality that all of what we have belongs to you.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.220]   Father, I pray, especially at the end of the year like this,
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.220]   would you impress it deep in our hearts
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.220]   about how much it is that you mean to us.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.220]   God, that you are our everything.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.220]   In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.

[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.220]   - Please be seated.
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:15.820]   - Good morning, Berean family.
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.720]   I'm Lawrence Moon, and I'm currently in BAM.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.720]   I'm grateful to talk about my walk with God
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.560]   and how he's relentlessly working in my life.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.520]   I hope this testimony conveys the power God's love has
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.360]   over someone undeserving like myself.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:32.220]   As a second-gen Korean American in Orange County,
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.760]   I grew up sheltered, privileged, and very comfortable.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.220]   Everyone I knew attended a church
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.120]   and professed to be a Christian.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.860]   Needless to say, Christianity was everywhere,
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.260]   and I wanted to fit in with the crowd.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.360]   The abundance of church and Christian identity
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.920]   made me spiritually pampered.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.320]   The earliest memory of my faith
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.300]   was when my grandmother dragged me to church
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.020]   and had me join her congregation.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:59.000]   I quickly became familiar with all of the praise songs
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.500]   and the songs' respective body motions,
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.760]   the larger-than-life stories in the Bible,
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.220]   and an oversimplified explanation of the gospel.
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.220]   As I got older, I remained in the church
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.360]   and ritualistically attended Sunday service.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.720]   I learned about sin and what Christians ought not to do.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.100]   I applied the things I learned to benefit only myself.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.520]   My heart was overwhelmed with self-pride,
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.660]   and my mind was hardened with a legalistic attitude.
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.220]   There was no question about it.
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.220]   I had the heart and mind of a Pharisee.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.560]   Throughout high school and college,
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.160]   I accepted Christ as my Savior
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.860]   and showed my outward Christian self
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.020]   on my own terms and conditions.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.460]   I was a Christian when it was convenient
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.960]   and beneficial for me, and never when it truly counted.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.800]   I nitpicked scriptures and ignored the scripture
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.500]   that exposed my faults and foolishness.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.940]   Whatever convictions I had were self-satisfying
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.000]   rather than being obedient to God's will.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.240]   I continued to walk down this path
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.760]   and focus solely on my own values,
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.460]   wants, ambitions, and vices.
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.900]   In the moments when I really needed to rely on God,
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.540]   I chose my own independence.
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.500]   I deferred obedience or self-satisfaction,
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.300]   and rather than having remembrance of Christ,
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.100]   I carelessly neglected Him.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.600]   It came to a point where I purposely
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.900]   left no room for Christ in my own heart.
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.260]   Several years ago, I experienced a season
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.640]   of constant failure, loss, and pain.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.000]   Everything I did out of my own abilities led to failure.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.100]   Whatever I considered important was now meaningless.
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.700]   All my efforts and endeavors ended in pain and loss.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.400]   I was in a perpetual state of failure and humiliation.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.000]   I had never been as desperate as I was
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.700]   to get out of it or make it stop.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.660]   As foolish as I was, I could not realize
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.440]   that this was the result of my own sins,
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.500]   the sin of prioritizing myself over Christ
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.900]   and rejecting Him over and over again.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.240]   At this time, I thought I was a genuine Christian
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.700]   because I would never reject Christ,
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.760]   but my repeated actions showed otherwise.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:04.000]   Despite my never-ending sins and failures,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.700]   I soon learned that God
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.440]   is a God of redemption and deliverance.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.600]   Although the season led me to brokenness and humility,
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.160]   Christ revealed that it is only Him
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.760]   who can overcome my self-rooted pride and depravity.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.400]   I came to truly understand that Christ
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.440]   had already loved and redeemed me
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:25.400]   in regards to my sins, shortcomings, and inadequacies.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.400]   Before I was able to know
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.160]   and experience God's redemptive power
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.600]   because I did not allow myself
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.560]   to fully participate in the process of His redemption,
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.560]   God revealed that my convictions were self-satisfying
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.960]   and that I was not obedient.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.600]   The desperation I was experiencing
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.160]   was truly a desire to be loved, accepted, and restored.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.360]   It was at this point Christ revealed
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.280]   that I needed to be intentionally honest
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.560]   and faithfully obedient.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.800]   The act of giving up control
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.180]   and letting go to gain everything that is Christ
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.640]   was so contradicting and uncomfortable to me.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.440]   Nonetheless, I surrendered myself to God
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.040]   and desired a true relationship with Him.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.160]   I realized that this relationship
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.080]   required obedience and consistency.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:07.960]   It was through obedience
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.120]   I got to experience a relationship with God,
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.320]   a relationship unlike any other.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.400]   I came to walk with God
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.980]   and my faith in Him grew exponentially.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.200]   I came across Ephesians 1:7-9
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.320]   and finally understood the love, grace,
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.340]   and dedication God had for His people.
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.600]   In Him we have redemption through His blood,
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.760]   the forgiveness of our trespasses,
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.680]   according to the riches of His grace
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.120]   which He lavished upon us,
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.560]   and all wisdom and insight
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.620]   making known to us the mystery of His will.
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.440]   According to His purpose
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.760]   which He set forth in Christ,
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.960]   it was through these experiences
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.800]   I got to truly experience and perceive Christ
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.520]   and joyfully walk with Him now.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.020]   Thank you.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.180]   (audience applauding)
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.020]   (water trickling)
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:14.680]   - Friends, you understand by going into the water
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.440]   uniting with Christ in His death,
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.440]   coming up out of the water
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.640]   uniting with Christ in His resurrected life.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.740]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:32.540]   (audience applauding)
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:46.380]   - Thank you so much, Lawrence.
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:51.400]   Would you turn with me to Proverbs chapter three?
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.500]   We'll be looking at verses five through six.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:07.780]   Proverbs three, verse five through six.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.960]   This is the last Sunday of the year.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.420]   We'll go to one of the most memorized,
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.080]   one of the most recognized passages in scripture.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.760]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.440]   and do not lean on your own understanding.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.800]   Acknowledge Him in all your ways
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.860]   and He will make your paths straight.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:35.840]   Heavenly Father, I pray that we would be able to see.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.840]   Would you give us eyes?
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.120]   Would you give us ears?
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.220]   Would you give us hearts that are ready to receive?
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:46.160]   Not from the word of man, but from the word of God.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.520]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.360]   Amen.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:55.300]   - My children, my older two children especially,
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.260]   have been asking a lot about like what is faith?
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.420]   What does it look like to have faith?
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.660]   And it's been a challenge to convey faith.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.060]   And one of the things that I have regularly been
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.540]   like kind of trying to help understand is using synonyms.
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.660]   I like synonyms.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.260]   And so like two of the words that I commonly begin to use
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.060]   is something like belief.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.180]   Like faith is having, like believing something
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.300]   or faith is also trusting something.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.900]   It's all kind of the same thing.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:29.420]   So when we come across our faith,
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.300]   when we first become a Christian,
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.460]   if you're a Christian in this room,
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:38.460]   that's a moment of faith that launches into a life of faith.
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:44.220]   And it's hard to really define faith.
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.500]   It's difficult to help somebody to understand it
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.260]   because it is exactly what it says it is.
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.060]   It just means to believe.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.180]   So if somebody asks, how do you believe?
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.080]   How do you answer something like that?
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.020]   You say, well, you believe.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.020]   You know, like you just do.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.100]   Remember somebody asked me once,
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.800]   how do you feel desperate for God?
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.340]   And I say, well, if you're drowning
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.220]   in the middle of the ocean, would you ask that question?
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.420]   How do you feel desperate?
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.300]   Well, you don't ask that question because it just is.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.420]   It comes as a result of sight.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.540]   So this belief that we're talking about,
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.060]   there's a surrender to it.
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:28.900]   It just, it knocks over the next domino right away.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.860]   Your trust is going to be something
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.840]   that your will is forfeited to.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.880]   If your beliefs change, then your life changes.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.980]   So for example, if you believe
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.420]   that a catastrophic disaster was on its way here,
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.620]   then your decisions and the things that you think
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.140]   and the next steps that you'll take
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.900]   and even the fact that you're like,
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.140]   should I even be sitting here in a service,
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.060]   it would begin to change.
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.820]   If somebody told you that some stock would quadruple,
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.180]   if you believe that, if you trusted that,
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.340]   if you had faith in that advice,
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.500]   then something would change.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.100]   You would do something about that.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.900]   And so what God is doing here is he is asking us
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.180]   to place our faith in him, to believe in him.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.300]   Ultimately, the word that he uses in this passage
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.580]   is to trust, to trust in him.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:30.420]   A trust means that we surrender to the trust.
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.300]   A trust means that our decisions change,
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.480]   our thinkings change, our emotions change.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.320]   It's not always easy,
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.360]   but we're going to be sanctified in this.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.120]   One of my children is very much like me,
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.160]   and they will ask like, what are we going to do next?
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.160]   That's how I am.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.720]   I just need to always know what's going to happen next.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.520]   I need to know what's coming down the pipeline.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.360]   And one of my children,
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.280]   it's there in a very unsophisticated form.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.360]   And so all day long, it's like, what are we gonna do?
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.640]   What are we gonna do today?
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.360]   What are we gonna do tonight?
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.560]   And then what are we gonna do after that?
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.160]   Are we gonna get dessert?
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.600]   And then after that, can we stay up a little bit later?
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   And then tomorrow morning, what time do I have to wake up?
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.160]   Can I wake up early?
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.520]   This kid's a morning person.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.240]   And then they'll be like, and then are we gonna
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.080]   do something fun?
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.720]   It's the holidays, it's the break,
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.780]   so what are we gonna do after that?
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.120]   And then on and on.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.200]   And we learn very early that if we answer,
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.740]   there is no end to this question.
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.920]   So if we say the entire thing we're gonna do today,
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.000]   then there's tomorrow, then the next.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.480]   She wants to know what's gonna happen in a week,
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.040]   in a month.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.960]   And she even says, in a year, this is what I'm going to do.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.600]   (laughs)
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.360]   This is very unhealthy.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.400]   This is not something you should be doing.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.840]   And we tell this child,
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:52.480]   just at a certain point, it's okay to ask,
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.160]   but you have to trust us.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.840]   We will tell you when the time is right,
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.220]   when you need to know.
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.780]   If you need to prepare something,
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.940]   at that moment, we'll tell you, prepare something.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.520]   Just enjoy life, just be with us, you know?
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.120]   Do you trust that we're trying to do
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.880]   what is best for you?
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:15.780]   I think very much so, though.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.280]   I said that this child is kind of like my carbon copy
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.940]   when it comes to that.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.340]   We really do want God to provide a turn-by-turn,
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.580]   kind of like a GPS.
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:29.540]   And until we know, we're not gonna be able to trust.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:33.520]   So we ask God, tell me this,
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.240]   and then what?
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.080]   Are you sure you're gonna do this?
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.420]   Are you sure this is going to be taken care of?
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:43.760]   I don't think we ask many times because we trust in Him.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.920]   I think it's because we don't trust in Him.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.540]   Many times, I think that's the heart we come with.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.560]   To live by faith and not by sight,
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.000]   to trust God and simply let that be,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.800]   to hear what He says and so just do.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.120]   Trusting in God is not something
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.880]   that just comes overnight, it's something that's grown.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.360]   And so in this passage today,
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.200]   we're going to be looking at these two verses,
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.540]   but it's in the middle of chapter three,
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.440]   verses one through 12, that all has the same structure.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.520]   And it's these admonitions that are given
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.680]   and these imperatives where God gives you something to do.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.080]   He says, this is my command to you,
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.880]   and then it's going to be followed by a positive consequence
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.760]   or a motivation that's going to cause you
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.280]   to desire to do that.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.280]   And just a fair warning, the three admonitions
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.440]   are going to be the same thing.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.900]   You're going to be like, didn't we just hear this?
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.920]   And I'm going to tell you right now, yes, you did.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.520]   Okay, we're going to say the same thing three times.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:48.040]   And so to look again at this passage here,
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.960]   if we go to the next slide, trust in the Lord,
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.440]   no, go ahead and go to the,
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.320]   trust in the Lord, do not lean,
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.800]   and acknowledge Him, these are the three admonitions.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.280]   So we're going to start off with trust,
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.680]   jump to acknowledge, and then go back to do not lean,
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.840]   and then we'll conclude with,
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.480]   He will make your paths straight.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:09.740]   Let's go to point number one.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:15.680]   The first two we'll look at here is a do.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.120]   It's a positive admonition.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.640]   It's something that He says, this is what I want of you.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.560]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.520]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.140]   Every day, every Sunday when we come in here,
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.240]   before service begins, there's something printed
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.360]   on the center of this screen.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.320]   You guys remember what that is, do you know?
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.520]   It might have become something, just wallpaper.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.280]   It says, please prepare your hearts for worship.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.680]   My question to you today is,
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.800]   did you do that this morning?
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   So it's there, but this is something much stronger.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.640]   These admonitions are very, very weighty.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.240]   It's a command to us to trust.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.820]   It's not just a suggestion.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:04.600]   It has an emphatic weight of a command given by God,
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   and she says this word very simply, trust, trust.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.940]   We're dependent creatures.
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.860]   We're people that have to trust in things.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:22.240]   All of 2024, we've had to trust in something.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:26.740]   It's ingrained in us because even though
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.600]   there may be the illusion of self-dependency,
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.600]   the illusion of independence, it's just that, an illusion.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.300]   We're helpless creatures.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.420]   Even for those of us who don't see ourselves
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.860]   as generally trusting people,
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.180]   you can have a deep trust in certain things in your life.
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.300]   Or perhaps you have a great and deep trust in yourself.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.720]   We even have a phrase that sometimes people throw around,
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.900]   don't trust anyone, only trust yourself,
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.340]   which is terrible advice.
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:01.020]   So the question is not, do we trust?
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.920]   The question is, what do I trust in?
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:08.580]   So all of 2024, the question is, what have I trusted in?
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.980]   What have I been trusting in?
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.620]   What do I trust in right now?
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:15.980]   This very morning, as you sit down, where is your trust?
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:20.980]   Are you sure that your trust
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.580]   is where you think it should be?
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.960]   We might trust in our own knowledge,
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.820]   that we've picked up a lot of knowledge,
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.660]   a lot of experiences over our lives.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.860]   And so we trust in that, just naturally.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.320]   We trust in the fact that we are intellectual
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:43.120]   when it comes to certain places in our lives.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.940]   Or perhaps we trust in our own intestinal fortitude,
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.220]   in the fact that we are grinders,
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.940]   that I can do something, I have high bandwidth,
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.240]   I have the ability to accomplish many things.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.100]   And so we're unable to trust people,
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.740]   we're unable to trust anything else, I gotta do it.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:06.060]   We can micromanage as a result.
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.740]   We might trust in our personality,
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.820]   we might trust in our charisma,
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:16.380]   that we've learned over the years that I'm good with people.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.980]   And so we trust in that ability.
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:25.420]   We trust in our skills, our education.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:30.780]   Yes, many of us trust in people, in our spouses,
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:35.140]   in parents, our friends, our mentors.
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.580]   You might place trust in a pastor, an elder.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:41.420]   It might even be people you don't know, a commentator.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:45.480]   It could be an online personality,
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.960]   a reviewer, an advisor, a medical professional
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.140]   who gives medical advice and prescribes medicine.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.740]   We can trust in all of these things.
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.300]   We might trust in financial institutions.
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:04.620]   We trust in retirement funds, in insurance.
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:08.580]   We trust in a country, we trust in a way of life.
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.340]   We trust in a culture, we trust in a politician.
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:16.860]   We trust every day in things, we trust in experiences
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.160]   that this thing is going to make me happy,
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.360]   that a break is going to make me happy,
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.760]   it's going to give me rest,
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.840]   that this vacation is going to bring me peace,
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.200]   it's going to bring me joy.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.440]   Possessions.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.640]   So what do we trust in?
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.260]   What have you been trusting in this year?
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.820]   This passage says to trust,
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.960]   and then he says trust in the Lord.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.460]   Now that word Lord is so heavy.
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:54.480]   That word Lord is a massive word.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.300]   It's the biggest word we have.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:02.260]   The word Lord is the word Yahweh.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:06.820]   It brings into your mind,
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.260]   it brings into all of who you are
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:13.300]   everything that he has proven himself to be
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.920]   in trustworthiness, in faithfulness.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:19.960]   Every page of scripture shows the Lord
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.360]   who he is and what he's done.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.300]   Every redemptive page of scripture
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.020]   showing how faithful he is.
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.360]   That Yahweh God who pulled Egypt out,
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.960]   who provided, who cared, who loved,
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.140]   who did all of these things,
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:39.140]   that he has promised, that this is guaranteed.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.580]   This word Yahweh, his name, the Lord,
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.340]   he is God, he is master, he is creator,
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.460]   he breathed and everything came to be.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.060]   He is the reason for all things.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.480]   He is the purpose of life.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.700]   Without him all things fall together.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.700]   You, me, we fall apart.
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.340]   Everything around us falls apart.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.180]   There is nothing that exists.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:04.000]   He says trust in the Lord as a command,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.940]   as an admonition to us.
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.020]   As if it would be so difficult for us,
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.600]   a command given to us because we are so prone
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.340]   to trust in other things, to trust in created things.
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:17.980]   He says trust in God, trust in the Lord.
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.460]   In your life, if you're a believer,
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.080]   you have reason after reason, experience after experience,
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.340]   testimony after testimony of how trustworthy
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.620]   he has been to you, how faithful he has been to you.
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:40.320]   It's so sad that he has to command us to trust in him.
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:45.160]   As if the cross would not prove that enough,
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.700]   that he gave Jesus his son and we still doubt,
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.460]   we still trust in these things
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.180]   that we have erected in our lives.
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.460]   We still trust in the things.
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.500]   We can say with our words all we want
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.900]   that we trust in the Lord.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.460]   We still doubt him.
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:06.540]   We still doubt him to provide, still doubt his goodness,
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.620]   still doubt that his grace is sufficient.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:14.560]   Faith is only as reliable, as strong and good
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.840]   as the object we place our faith in.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:21.240]   It makes absolutely no sense to trust in anything else,
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.240]   anyone else.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.780]   It doesn't matter how proven a record is.
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.280]   It doesn't matter how good a man seems.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:31.460]   It doesn't matter how smart a doctor is, how accomplished.
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.160]   It doesn't matter how good I am, how strong I am,
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.520]   how smart I am.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.260]   It doesn't matter that these things promise
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:43.280]   so many good things as a result.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.460]   The only thing that makes sense to put our trust in is here.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:52.360]   To trust him has little to do with the strength of our faith
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.340]   and everything to do with the object of our faith.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.700]   He is massive in trustworthiness.
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.860]   It is wise to trust God.
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.980]   No matter how bleak things seem to be,
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:05.780]   no matter how horribly insufficient we are,
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.420]   and no matter how everything happening around us
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:13.420]   seems to shake, it is wise to trust in the Lord.
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:17.940]   We don't falter because he is this big.
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.660]   He is this trustworthy.
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.620]   Trusting in God doesn't mean you turn off
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.060]   rationality or logic.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:29.420]   It means that our rationality and logic is being sanctified.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.540]   It's being sanctified in truth that we see things
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.960]   differently, that this makes more sense,
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.900]   that I trust in God more than I trust my eyes,
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.640]   more than I touch my senses.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:44.740]   More than I trust my experiences.
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.340]   All of these things, I trust God.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.600]   And so he says, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart."
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.100]   What the proverb says here is complete and whole,
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.020]   asking for everything, holding nothing back,
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.380]   no shred of doubt, not a shadow of a doubt.
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:03.840]   God understands that we are doubting people.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.000]   Trusting in God with all the heart means
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.100]   that this is the end to which we work towards.
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:12.640]   We trust God even if the outcome seems unfavorable.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.340]   Even though it seems like everything
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.980]   is quaking underneath us.
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.660]   Even if it feels like everything is falling apart.
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.660]   Even if it feels like the consequences
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.300]   are too difficult to bear.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.500]   Even if there is a death, we trust in God.
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:31.460]   Nothing reserved, all our hearts opened up,
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.800]   empty to him, surrendered completely and holy.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.560]   He says, "With all of your heart."
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.360]   Nowhere in scripture does it say, "With only a part."
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.880]   Nowhere in scripture does it say,
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.880]   "Just do your best to give what you can."
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.880]   He always demands the whole thing.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.360]   He says, "Trust with all of it."
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.560]   The heart is made up wholly of the mind,
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.040]   the emotions, and the will.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.720]   Three things, mind, emotion, will.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.940]   So first we are called to surrender our minds,
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.660]   the entirety of our thoughts, our logic, our rationale.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.580]   Even if things don't make sense.
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.380]   Even if it feels like I know better,
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:12.000]   that I can trust in myself.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.100]   That God is not a last resort.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.460]   That I turn to when all other things go bad.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.920]   God is everything.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:23.260]   Jeremiah chapter 17 verse nine talks about this.
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.460]   The heart is more deceitful than all else
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.740]   and is desperately sick.
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:27.720]   Who can understand it?
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.800]   We can't trust ourselves.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:36.600]   Our thinking is faulty if it is not sanctified in truth.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:42.780]   We are called to surrender our emotions.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.460]   If something feels off, if there is loneliness,
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.760]   if there is depression, if there is anger,
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.900]   we surrender our emotions to him.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:54.060]   The reason why those things many times,
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.220]   many times the reason why those things are there
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.580]   is because we do not trust God.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.500]   I'm not saying you go to someone and say trust God,
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.220]   you know like that's a command to you.
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.820]   But we have to wrestle with this.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.380]   We have to grapple with it.
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.960]   That the reason why we have depression
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.240]   is because we do not have this thing that I want
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.580]   and I am holding onto it and that's it.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.940]   This is all I have and I need to hold on
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:16.340]   and I can't let go to God.
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:17.580]   I'm not saying it's easy.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.700]   I'm saying this is difficult.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.200]   This is hard for me, this is hard for all of us.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.800]   Yet we understand this to be a truth
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.920]   that God is there demanding of us.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.260]   Trust in the Lord with all of your heart.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.720]   Let it go.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:33.200]   Give your emotions to him.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.720]   We trust him.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.960]   In our anger, the reason why we hold onto anger
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.600]   is because we cannot trust him.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.780]   We have to be in control.
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:45.640]   That this is something that I need to enact,
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.520]   my vengeance, my judgment.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.560]   We cannot trust him to his.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:54.560]   We need to trust him in places of fear.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:46:02.560]   But even in good emotions, we can't trust those things.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.380]   Sometimes we have happiness.
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:09.000]   Sometimes we think that even in a place
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.600]   where we are in sin that we're in a place of peace.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.300]   There are those of us who are sitting in this room
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.840]   who are living in unrepentant sin, in rebellion,
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.400]   and you can sing songs of praise to God
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.460]   that he loves you and that you live for him.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.440]   And so you feel good about it.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.280]   You're like, I'm okay.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.640]   I think God's okay with it.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.960]   We don't even trust in those feelings.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.080]   We trust in God.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.600]   We trust in what he says.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.280]   We trust in the fact that what he says is true.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.720]   We do not trust in our emotions.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.020]   Look at Psalm 13.1.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.120]   This is a man who feels things
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.080]   and then he does something about it.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.920]   How long, oh Lord, will you forget me forever?
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.920]   How long will you hide your face from me?
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.040]   How long shall I take counsel in my soul,
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.240]   having sorrow in my heart and all the day?
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.240]   How long will my enemy be exalted over me?
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.280]   And then look at where he comes to.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.120]   Look at these words.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:06.920]   He says, but I have trusted in your lovingkindness.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.680]   My heart shall rejoice in your salvation.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.840]   I will sing to the Lord
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.800]   because he has dealt bountifully with me.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.800]   We have to surrender our emotions to God.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.960]   And thirdly here, we're called to surrender our will,
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.640]   that we trust in application, in action,
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:25.580]   in tangible acts of obedience, that we do.
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.900]   It can't be something that we just resolve in our minds
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:28.960]   and it sits there.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.400]   Good thoughts of how I know I ought to live.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.400]   It can't be something today that we say,
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.200]   oh, that sounds great, I'll get to it one day.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.680]   If you know it to be true,
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.600]   if you are truly trusting in the Lord
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.720]   with all of your heart means you surrender your will.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:50.620]   What you do, the decisions you make, it cannot sit there.
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.720]   James chapter one, verse two,
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.440]   but prove yourselves doers of the word
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.080]   and not merely hearers who, listen to what it says,
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.760]   delude themselves.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:03.560]   Do not delude yourselves this morning.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.320]   We are called to surrender our will.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:12.280]   Remember, this trust isn't something that comes overnight.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.460]   It's built with time.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.680]   Like in any relationship, it's built with time.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.700]   So you must not do this in momentary spurts,
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.520]   but you have to exercise this trust
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.320]   consistently in your life.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.840]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.840]   Wake up the next morning.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.280]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.720]   Before you go to bed, trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.500]   Have I done that today?
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.740]   Through the day, am I trusting him?
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.940]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.480]   Secondly, same thing, do this.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.420]   Acknowledge him in all your ways.
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.080]   It's literally, this is repetition.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.720]   Acknowledge him in all your ways.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.800]   Now what does it mean to acknowledge?
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.160]   In English, we sometimes think of it
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.120]   as giving credit to someone.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.920]   If you are familiar with social media,
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.160]   sometimes you'll see a picture and it says PC,
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.640]   and that means, I think, I think photo credit.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.560]   And that means that somebody has a picture
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.080]   and they're saying, I didn't take the picture,
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.360]   somebody else took the picture.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.560]   Many times it's of themselves,
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.580]   so I don't know why that makes any sense for me,
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.100]   for people to put that up.
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:17.660]   And they'll give a name, right?
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:19.860]   They'll say, Daniel Hsu, or something like that, right?
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.420]   And so these things are there.
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:25.700]   And it's like, I'm giving acknowledgement to this man,
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.300]   to this woman who took this picture.
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.540]   Or at the end of an event, somebody will come up,
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.740]   an MC will come up, and what will they do?
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.860]   They'll say something like, hey, can we acknowledge
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:35.900]   the people who made this event happen?
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:39.140]   And then everybody gives them a big round of applause.
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:40.120]   Acknowledgement.
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:45.540]   Well, I think this understanding is present
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:49.600]   in this word here, acknowledge God, but it's not complete.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:56.740]   Acknowledge means to know, or to learn to know.
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.140]   That's what acknowledge means.
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.940]   Or more specific to this text, it means to know a person,
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.620]   or to be acquainted with someone.
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:08.240]   Basically, acknowledge God means to know God.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:11.680]   It means to know who he is.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.220]   It means to know what he's like.
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:18.500]   It means to understand, to walk with this God,
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.060]   and know that his character and his ways are true.
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.800]   It means to acknowledge God, to recognize,
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.460]   despite all that's going around me,
[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:28.260]   even if every evidence points away to the fact
[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.340]   that God is good, I know that God is good.
[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:35.380]   This is who he is.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.020]   I've come to know with all of my experiences,
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:41.600]   and now, even if everything seems like it's going awry,
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.000]   even if it seems like all my logic and rationale
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.080]   is pointing against that, when I was growing up,
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.580]   my dad, he would pick me up.
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.760]   He was my main picking up person,
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.440]   and he would do that after school,
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.040]   after these events, and things like that.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.040]   Now, my dad was also notoriously late.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.960]   I was always the last one picked up.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.200]   I hated it.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.440]   I hated it so much.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.520]   In third grade, I remember my friend,
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.920]   who was always second to last being picked up,
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.240]   would look up over at me and say like,
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.640]   "Why is your dad always so late?"
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.480]   (laughs)
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.320]   I'd be like, "Dude, ridiculous."
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.240]   And so, I looked over at him, and I'm like,
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.200]   "Well, every time he comes, though,"
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.760]   I remember yelling that at him.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:20.700]   I know, "Every time he comes."
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:23.600]   Now, it would be like a 2.30 pick up,
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.120]   and I remember one day, it was 2.30,
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.960]   and then it was 3.30, and then it was 4.30.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.000]   I was sitting there, I was like,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.800]   "Every day he comes, you know, he comes.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.400]   "He's going to come."
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.360]   I started thinking in my mind,
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:37.540]   should I start running?
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.640]   If I run home, it might take only an hour and a half.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.720]   (laughs)
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.440]   And then, of course, he came.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.480]   He finally came, because that's who my dad was.
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.060]   He's late, but he always comes.
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.740]   Got in the car, and I yelled at him,
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:53.580]   "Why?
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.700]   "Why do you do this to me?
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:58.840]   "You're taking years off my life, Father."
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.560]   Telling him these things, but this is who he was.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.000]   Now, who is God?
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.560]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:06.760]   and it says acknowledge him, to know him,
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.960]   to be acquainted with him, to understand him,
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.720]   to know that he has pulled through time and time again,
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.200]   that I know who he is, that your friends are coming
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.600]   and saying, "Hey, it doesn't make sense to trust in him.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.660]   "You should do this, and this, and this.
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:20.440]   "Hey, turn your back on God.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.720]   "He's done nothing good for you in your life.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.360]   "Why would you continue to follow him?"
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.920]   And we sit here, and it's not just like,
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.320]   "Oh, but I believe in him."
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.300]   No, it's with full confidence.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.600]   He has proven himself time and time again.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.280]   Every page in Scripture, every page of my life,
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.600]   he has only proven himself to be good.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:44.240]   I acknowledge him, I know him.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.100]   I walk with him, I understand him.
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:49.800]   Romans 8.28.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.720]   Look at how Romans 8.28,
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.000]   at least in the part that I'm showing you.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   It starts with, "And we know."
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.680]   Know.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:04.340]   But do we,
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:08.080]   do we really know?
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:11.280]   Do we understand the words that come after this?
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.140]   Because I know you know this passage.
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:18.640]   And we know that God causes all things to work together
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.640]   for good to those who love God,
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.960]   to those who are called according to his purpose.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.600]   We know this.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.320]   We understand this about God.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.360]   It is not a concept, it is not a theology,
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.600]   it is not a theory.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.560]   This is who he is.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.480]   Guaranteed.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:35.440]   Take it to the bank.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.720]   I'll put my money on it.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.640]   I'll stake my life on it.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.040]   In fact, I already have.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.740]   As a Christian, we have staked our lives on this fact
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.040]   that this is who God is,
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.440]   that he will work all things together for good
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.480]   to those who love God, for those whom he foreknew.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.040]   And this is the golden chain of redemption.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.720]   He also predestined to become conformed
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.180]   to the image of his son,
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.920]   so that he would be the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.880]   And these whom he predestined, he also called.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.360]   These whom he called, he also justified.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.720]   And these whom he justified, he also glorified.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.600]   What then shall we say to these things?
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.880]   Look at what verse 31 is doing to us.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.680]   He said, we know this is who God is.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.760]   What are we gonna say?
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.600]   Who's gonna say anything?
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:14.960]   This is who God is.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:19.680]   And so he says, if God is for us, who is against us?
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.600]   He who did not spare his own son,
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.560]   but delivered him over for us all.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.720]   How will he not also with him freely give us all things?
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.800]   God is not missing in our decisions
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:31.500]   because we acknowledge who he is.
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:34.720]   We say like we do all things for God's glory.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.320]   We want every decision we make to be for God's glory.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.320]   We wanna raise our children for God.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.680]   We wanna work in the workplace for God.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.960]   We wanna do all these things for God.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:47.600]   Then we are called to trust in him in these things.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.000]   That means we must surrender our will.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.560]   We must surrender our emotions.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.200]   We must surrender our minds.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.000]   We must give the entirety of our hearts
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.560]   and we acknowledge him.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.640]   And the next one here is in all your ways.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.680]   He says, acknowledge him in all your ways.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.120]   Before it was trust God with all heart.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.100]   Now it's acknowledge in everything that you do.
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.400]   I told you, it's just repetition.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.480]   We're gonna say the same thing.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.240]   In every path, in every decision,
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:18.960]   small decisions, big decisions, it's not devoid of God.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.280]   Regardless of massive repercussions,
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.560]   of whether something that I want is gonna be taken away,
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.500]   whether something that I value then
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:29.180]   is going to evaporate on me,
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:32.320]   that I learn to trust in everything.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.400]   Not just the things that are easy and the medium things.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.640]   And then some hard things.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:39.640]   It's every single thing in all our ways.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.640]   Regardless of repercussion, we live in the face of God.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:43.680]   It's called koram deo.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:47.000]   We live living in his presence and understanding who he is.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.720]   And so all the things that we do, it's God is there.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.560]   Everything that we do, we walk into it
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.160]   understanding that God is there.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.200]   God is there in our workplaces, in our rooms.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.040]   He is there in our car.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.240]   He is there with us.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.500]   He is the reason that we live
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.320]   and we collectively understand this.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:02.920]   Faith is not just intellectual.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.080]   Faith is felt.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.760]   It is lived.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.980]   It's breathed.
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:13.160]   And faith is grown because it is not just a theology
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.000]   that is ingrained in you over and over and over again.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.720]   It is not a class that you take.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:20.000]   We have a class here that maybe we'll make a class,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.580]   a faith class.
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:23.800]   Strengthen the faith class.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.800]   And we tell you every time, hey, God is trustworthy.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.560]   You would stop coming to that class
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.800]   because you already know that.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.260]   That class is every day of our lives.
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.160]   God is trustworthy.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.440]   And you place your trust in him
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.160]   even when everything feels like it's so hard to do that.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.340]   But we do what he says.
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.180]   It makes sense.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:43.160]   And so we do it.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.920]   And wherever it takes us, it takes us.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:48.060]   And he proves himself trustworthy and my faith grows.
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:51.980]   Without obedience, your faith will not grow.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:59.300]   When I was teaching my eldest, Addie, how to swim,
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:02.440]   again, I can't remember if I gave this image before,
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.840]   but it was just helpful for me,
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:04.680]   where she held on,
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:08.040]   she was clinging onto the side of the swimming pool.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.320]   For most of her swimming life,
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:13.080]   she had on those things
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:18.080]   that the floaties, floaties, thank you.
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.200]   She had on the floaties most of her life.
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:21.560]   And I understand that.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:23.960]   Putting myself in her shoes, that is terrifying.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.520]   You take those things off and you're,
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:28.320]   you know, so all her trust transferred
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:31.200]   because she, as a, you know, when she had the floaties on,
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.320]   she was swimming around, yeah, jumping,
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.940]   you know, like all that kind of stuff.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:38.480]   As soon as those came off,
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:41.880]   her trust transferred from the floaties to the wall.
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:45.920]   And I saw her fingers, it was so cute,
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.680]   her tiny little fingers clinging to the wall.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:49.280]   It was all white.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:51.720]   Right here was white and right here was red, you know.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:52.880]   And she was like, "Ugh."
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:58.160]   And I was standing there, in three feet,
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:02.520]   saying, "Come," and clinging on.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:06.560]   And she was like, we're going back and forth.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.120]   I was using every trick in the book.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.920]   It's like, "Do you want candy?
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:10.760]   "Come right now."
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:13.040]   You know, like, I was using every trick in the book.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.760]   And as she's clinging on,
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.820]   the words I would use, it's like, "Don't you trust me?
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:18.100]   "You can trust me.
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.000]   "I'll catch you, don't worry.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.600]   "Nothing will happen.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.840]   "It's going to be fun, you know, whatever."
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.280]   All that stuff was happening.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:29.440]   And for her, I understand, she's clinging on.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.260]   Daddy's way across the swimming pool.
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.100]   I'm literally two feet away.
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:38.060]   She needs to let go, turn her body, and that's it.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.240]   She said, "Trust in me."
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:45.680]   Finally, I was like,
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.120]   as we're, like, I was using all my logic
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.120]   with this four-year-old.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.940]   Tried to get her to understand and see life
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:53.280]   in a rational way.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.560]   You know, like, "Do you think you're going to start,
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.680]   "like, drowning, and I'm just going to watch you?"
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.080]   You know, like, do this.
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.920]   No, she finally turned, and I said, "Okay, do you trust me?"
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:04.120]   And she said, she nodded her head.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:07.040]   And I remember her taking one hand off the wall.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.400]   She took one hand off the wall,
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.360]   and then she, like, kind of reached towards me,
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.720]   and then she went like this again.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:13.520]   I was like, "Oh, that was so close."
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:18.120]   Now, a question I have for you is, when is trust born?
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:22.960]   In this situation, when is trust,
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:25.800]   when is faith and belief, when is it birthed?
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:30.180]   Was that trust?
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:33.760]   It wasn't, right?
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.480]   I'm sure all of you would say what I'm going to say now.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:41.480]   Trust is born when she let go, and she turned towards me.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.600]   Trust was born when she trusted in me,
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:46.720]   and she surrendered herself to that fact.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.640]   She surrendered herself to the will,
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:51.360]   and literally, she turned, and she clung onto me,
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.500]   and her fingernails dug into my arms.
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.760]   And I said, "Was that fun?"
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:56.960]   And she nodded her head.
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:02.960]   Acknowledge Him in all your ways.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.240]   Trust in the Lord with all of your heart,
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.960]   with everything, and that necessarily means
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.200]   we get to this third point.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.040]   Don't do this.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.440]   So the first two are positive admonitions.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.640]   This is negative admonition.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.960]   Do not lean on your own understanding.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.000]   Don't lean on what makes sense to you.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.800]   Don't cling so hard onto the things
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.240]   that you feel like you need.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.560]   You are placing your trust somewhere.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.680]   Is it on God, or is it on these things?
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.420]   There is no in-between state.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.280]   In-between state means drowning.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.920]   It is, you are here, or you are here.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.040]   Where are you?
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.600]   In your finances, where are you?
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.560]   In your relationships, where are you?
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.340]   In the things that promise pleasure,
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:47.240]   in the places that promise rest, peace, joy, happiness.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.000]   Do you trust in the things of the world,
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.320]   or do you trust in God?
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.180]   He says, "Don't trust in your own understanding."
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:57.860]   John Piper says, "It is insanity to trust in himself."
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:01.720]   It is insane, it is crazy.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.680]   It defies logic to trust in self.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:09.080]   We are fools who live in a world of fools.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:14.680]   But fools don't look like fools, to the world looks wise.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.120]   And that's why we follow these things,
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.160]   because it looks wise.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.080]   We don't follow foolish things.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.360]   We don't look like, "Oh, I'm glad
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.160]   "that this is gonna make me crash."
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.000]   We're not gonna do that.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.160]   It's promising something, we put our trust in it.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.800]   But look at what 1 Corinthians 1:20 says.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.800]   He asks this question, almost as if he's looking
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.960]   around, "Where is the wise man?
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.360]   "Where's the debater, where's the scribe,
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.200]   "the debater of the age?
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.240]   "Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.400]   "For since in the wisdom of God,
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.360]   "the world through its wisdom did not come to know God,
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.040]   "God was well pleased through the foolishness
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.920]   "of the message preached to save those who believe."
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.120]   And look at this, this is the wall.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.560]   This is what the Jews and the Greeks would cling to.
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.040]   It says, "The Jews ask for signs,
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.840]   "and the Greeks search for wisdom,
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.800]   "but we preach Christ crucified,
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.200]   "a stumbling block to Jews, to Gentiles' foolishness,
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.040]   "but to those who are called both Jews and Greeks,
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.000]   "Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God,
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.200]   "because the foolishness of God is wiser than men,
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.440]   "and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:12.040]   So not leaning on your own understanding means
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.640]   that number one, you cultivate a biblical world view,
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.880]   and number two, you live in accordance to it.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:21.160]   That's what it means not to lean on your own understanding.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.520]   It's to don't trust in your eyesight.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.320]   Don't trust in your own senses.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.520]   Don't trust in your own senses.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.000]   Trust in the Word.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.720]   Trust in what God says.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.800]   You are blind.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.040]   You are in the dark.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.560]   He sees everything clearly.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.200]   And so when he tells us something,
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.280]   then we say, "That makes sense."
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.240]   So are you sure?
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.080]   It's okay to ask questions.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.320]   Are you sure?
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.480]   God says, "Yes."
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.320]   You say, "Okay."
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.960]   Not leaning on your own understanding means
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.520]   that we don't doubt God in our lives.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.240]   In Solomon 14.1, it says, "The fool has said in his heart,
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.640]   "there is no God."
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.680]   So many of us living as practical atheists
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.000]   who profess with their mouth that we trust God,
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.560]   and yet by the fact that we place trust in things,
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.040]   we acknowledge that he is not there,
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.600]   that he is not trustworthy, or something like that.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.360]   And we're foolish in that place.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.200]   There is no God is what we're saying by our lifestyle,
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.160]   by our choices.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.600]   We're saying there's no God here.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.240]   And so I cling so hard to people.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:21.080]   I cling so hard to things.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.400]   What does it mean to lean on something?
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.080]   Most of us in here are leaning on something right now.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.640]   You sat down because you put 100% of your faith
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.480]   in that chair to hold you up.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:37.880]   It means to allow something to take your weight.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.760]   And if the thing falls, you fall.
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.480]   And this thing that we are tempted to lean on
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.720]   is our own understanding.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720]   We cling to ourself.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.920]   We lean on it.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.720]   And that's so foolish.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.360]   We need immediate clarity.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.440]   We cling to ourselves, and that everything needs to connect,
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.160]   and everything needs to make sense to me,
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.920]   and it needs to happen right now.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.040]   Or I'll give you a certain amount of time, God,
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.120]   this much time I'll give that I'll trust in you,
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.360]   but if that time expires,
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.280]   then I guess I gotta take things into my own hands.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:12.200]   Or perhaps at that point, anger comes.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.680]   I've been patient enough.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:19.720]   I can trust him for a moment,
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:21.680]   but if a month goes by and nothing's changed,
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.440]   we can go right back to our own understanding.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.400]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.560]   Do not lean on your own understanding
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.400]   in all your ways.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.240]   Acknowledge him.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.400]   This all means it is perpetually done
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.720]   as we grow in our faith.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.680]   It is called sanctification.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:39.640]   H.P. Charles has given an image of faith
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.000]   that stuck with me once,
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.640]   that sometimes following God will lead you
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.000]   into a raging river.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.400]   Does that make any sense?
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.040]   Just like with Addie,
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.600]   she was holding onto the side of the pool.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.520]   I says, "Come."
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.520]   It made no sense to her.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.600]   She's like, "No."
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.320]   Something wrestling around in here,
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.760]   but like her actions showed, right?
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.200]   And we see a raging river in our lives,
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.840]   and we lean on our own understanding.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.160]   It'll take us far from the river
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.360]   that God is trying to guide us through.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.560]   On the other side of this river,
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.880]   there is something there
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.720]   that going back this way or this way,
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.080]   using and leaning on your own understanding
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:15.920]   is going to,
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.600]   you don't see what hides behind that brush.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.800]   You don't know what's going behind that mountain.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:20.880]   Go through the river.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.040]   It's raging.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.840]   And so Isaiah 43, one says,
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.400]   "But now," that says the Lord,
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.120]   and look at all the qualifications He needs to give.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.680]   He says, "Yahweh, your creator,
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.760]   "He formed you.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.160]   "He redeemed you.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:38.000]   "When you pass through the waters,
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.960]   "I will be with you.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.000]   "And through the rivers,
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.680]   "they will not overflow you.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:43.720]   "When you walk through the fire,
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:44.840]   "you will not be scorched,
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.640]   "nor will the flame burn you."
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.560]   Don't trust on your own understanding,
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:53.320]   your savings, the occupation ladder,
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.120]   building up a life here in this world.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.440]   Do not trust your brain.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.880]   Do not trust your heart.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.520]   None of these things over God's word.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:03.560]   God's word reshapes everything
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.960]   about how we view the world.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.360]   Notice it doesn't mean we throw out our brain.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.080]   It doesn't mean we throw out our heart.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.600]   It means that we are evaluating things so differently.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.680]   It makes sense,
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.200]   even to the point where Apostle Paul would say,
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.040]   "To live is Christ, and to die is gain."
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.800]   How does that make sense to the world?
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:28.760]   Recently, for us, a loved one passed away.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.920]   And for a majority of these holidays,
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.360]   I've been, or for the last few days,
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.320]   I've been going through his belongings.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.560]   It's been very sobering.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:40.360]   And I realized that you could just so quickly
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.880]   read the story of a man through his belongings.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.000]   What he cared for,
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.160]   what he valued,
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.080]   what he trusted and believed in.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:56.320]   Came across bank statements and journal entries, pictures.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:02.520]   It's going through the entirety of a man's life.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:08.960]   I was so sobering because sitting there,
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.880]   looking, poring over these statements,
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:15.840]   and just seeing what that he,
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:16.920]   at least for that moment,
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.760]   what he lived for,
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.120]   what he valued,
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.480]   what he desired,
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.320]   what he cared about,
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.680]   what he trusted in,
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.640]   all of that scene right in front of me.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:31.360]   I was thinking about the decisions I make,
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.200]   the fact that I stand on a pulpit behind a mic,
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:39.240]   expounding on these great and fabulous truths,
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:44.160]   and I had to reflect upon that and ask myself,
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:49.880]   man, I cannot be up here saying trust in the Lord
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.520]   if I am not trusting in the Lord.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:57.240]   And I wanna ask you of that.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:02.360]   Don't be flippant with your words.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:06.800]   We must not be flippant with our words.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.320]   If we're not trusting in God,
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.360]   let's just say we're not trusting in God.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.400]   If we're not following Jesus,
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.680]   let's stop just saying like we're following Jesus.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:21.680]   Let's just be who we say we are.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.840]   Let's let our bank statements,
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.680]   the things we purchase,
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.520]   the things we value,
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.200]   the things we platform on pedestal,
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.320]   the things we dream about,
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.320]   the things we desire,
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.000]   if it is not Christ,
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.360]   then let's just say it.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:39.680]   It would make no sense to just sit there and just lie.
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.840]   (silence)
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:52.480]   We lean on our own understanding.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.600]   We appropriate God's word.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.320]   We force God's word to mean what we want it to mean.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:00.520]   We have a set way,
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.400]   and we understand what we want,
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:06.240]   and we try to find the things to buttress up
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.080]   with God's word what we want.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.120]   We say here that we don't isojeet,
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.400]   and we isojeet every day of our lives.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:21.960]   You can't say you're trusting in God,
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.880]   following Christ,
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.400]   and yet you live your own way.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.920]   If you're leaning on your own understanding,
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.960]   you are not leaning on God's understanding.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.280]   If you're trusting in yourself,
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.520]   you are not trusting in God.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.600]   If you're trusting in things,
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.920]   you are not trusting in him.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.600]   You can say that you believe in God.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.200]   You can trust in God and yet go after whatever it is
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.040]   that you're going after.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.960]   Your decisions will show.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.320]   We are called to surrender,
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.160]   to submit,
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.000]   to yield,
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:47.840]   to let go.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.360]   Again, remember the time you gave your faith to Christ.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:53.400]   You said you can have it all.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.960]   You wanted to give God everything at the time,
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.280]   and it is the same today
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.320]   for every believer sitting in this room.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.320]   Let's go back.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.720]   Let's pour over our lives.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.320]   Let's look at how we're living
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.960]   and surrender,
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.000]   submit,
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   yield,
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.480]   let go
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.920]   of our trust in the things
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.200]   that make no sense to trust in,
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:26.320]   lest we come to the end of our lives.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.120]   We must not live foolishly.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:43.040]   He makes a promise for us is the last point.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.640]   He will make your path straight.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.040]   It's hard to know,
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.040]   like, is this a promise?
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.040]   The Proverbs are difficult in that way.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.320]   But this is the positive affirmation
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.600]   that he will make your path straight.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.800]   What does straight mean?
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.600]   Does straight mean that it looks like the way
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:02.880]   I think straight would look like?
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.000]   No, it doesn't, it rarely does.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.840]   That's why he has instructed us to trust in him
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.960]   because it's like, we're trying to go there.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.360]   Why are you taking us there?
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:15.480]   We don't trust in our own heart.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.320]   We entrust our heart to him.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.600]   But many times,
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.280]   because trusting him leads us into darkness and danger,
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.800]   trusting him will lead us into threats to career.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.160]   It will lead us into threats to our bank accounts,
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.320]   threats to our friendships,
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.640]   threats to our free time,
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:30.560]   to the things that we want.
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.840]   It's going to threaten all of that.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.320]   Trusting him, in him,
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:38.840]   will sometimes come with great sacrifice and consequences.
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.400]   Philippians chapter three, verse 10 says that,
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.600]   "I may know him and the power of his resurrection
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:45.880]   "and the fellowship of his sufferings,
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.160]   "being conformed to his death."
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.680]   I wish it just said life.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.160]   I wish it would just talk about the fact
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.600]   that there will be blessings and joy and peace in Christ,
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.800]   that he will just take us down
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.940]   and it's going to be green and it's going to be good.
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.120]   You can trust in him,
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:02.200]   that he will do what is, like, safe for you.
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.280]   And accept in our lives
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.720]   that he's going to take us directly into danger.
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:09.640]   But we already know that.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:16.280]   I was looking at a map here of Christ's road to the cross.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.000]   And Christ's road to the cross,
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.040]   if you go to the next slide here,
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.800]   it's the most useless map I've ever seen.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.720]   It's useless because I have no idea,
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.280]   just red markers, Jesus went everywhere.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.200]   I don't know where it begins.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.120]   I'm guessing Bethlehem.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.840]   And then somewhere he goes to Nazareth
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:33.900]   and then he just keeps going.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:36.380]   But this was his road to the cross.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:41.320]   And what this passage means,
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.000]   he will make your path straight.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.960]   It means that this was a straight line.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.760]   That this was straight.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.700]   That God has intentions and purposes
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.120]   that he's leaning us down.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.480]   That this is the right way.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.840]   That this is the good way.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.060]   The safest way.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.360]   Sometimes it'll feel like a roundabout,
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.080]   but trusting in God is the best path.
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.880]   Genesis 50, 20 says, as for you,
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.440]   you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.120]   In order to bring about this present result
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.600]   to preserve many people alive.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:16.240]   Remember Joseph's life, how it brought him to this point.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.640]   How many ups and downs.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:21.000]   And now it gives us a comfort.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.800]   Probably when you first became a Christian,
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:23.720]   you read something like this.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.880]   And now, many years into Christianity,
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.240]   you're reading it again.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.240]   Nothing has changed.
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.920]   There are times in my counsel to people
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.120]   when they want something so much,
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.300]   they will trick themselves into thinking they know best.
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.780]   And make decisions to get to an end
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:40.000]   that ultimately ends up prolonging the season of difficulty.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.440]   And in my mind, afterwards, I say,
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.400]   he's like, why, why'd you do that?
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.000]   You did that because it was according
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.920]   to your own understanding.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.040]   If you just waited patiently for God.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.880]   If you did what was right before him.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.080]   If you just entrusted yourself to him.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:57.240]   You're the one zigzagging.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.840]   He would have taken you the straightest, best path.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.360]   You've prolonged it.
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:11.440]   This means that we'll have to wait many times actively
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.760]   to trust that God will make your path straight.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.720]   It means that you'll be living in accordance
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.760]   to his path for you.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:20.680]   Not that he will give you whatever it is that you want.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.520]   Life may not, and probably will not,
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.240]   look exactly the way you want it to look.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.560]   But we're okay with that because we trust him.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:33.600]   I gotta wrap up the sermon.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.000]   So there's a quote from Chuck Smith.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.640]   He says, "Part of the fruit of doing God's will
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.840]   "is the satisfaction and joy of doing it."
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.720]   Many times we trust God as if he's going to just give me
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:45.320]   the things that are going to satisfy me.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.400]   The obedience is the joy.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:54.820]   Living for God's will is so fulfilling.
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:56.860]   And you'll see it.
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:02.660]   So as we head towards New Year's Eve service,
[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:05.140]   that's in two days.
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:06.860]   I wanna ask you to consider that.
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:09.660]   To start to think now, and don't just do it
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:12.180]   when we get to 11 o'clock on New Year's Eve.
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:13.780]   Start to think over the next two days,
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:15.540]   rest of today, Monday, and Tuesday.
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:20.260]   What was I trusting in this past year?
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:25.260]   Can I say that I trusted in the Lord with all my heart?
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:31.700]   If you have accountability partners, message them.
[01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:34.300]   Tell them this is what I had been trusting
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:35.220]   in this past year.
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:40.380]   But remind them that you want to trust in God.
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:43.660]   You'll be making steps to do so.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:47.140]   I have some applications,
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:48.980]   which we don't have time to go through.
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:49.820]   But I'm gonna do it.
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:50.940]   I have some applications,
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:52.900]   which we don't have time to go through.
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:59.060]   Yeah, I guess that's what we'll do, okay.
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:15:59.900]   Let's pray.
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:12.580]   Father, we ask you, Lord,
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:15.980]   to help us do what it is that we truly want here.
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:22.540]   God, it is with confidence
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:24.620]   that we can say you are trustworthy.
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:28.540]   What lags behind is my trust.
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:32.580]   And so I pray, Lord, that our church would be one
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:36.380]   that understands that the same call
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.860]   that brought us to Christ in the beginning
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:39.500]   is the same call for me today.
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:43.980]   It's all yours.
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:46.620]   We trust fully in you.
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:50.180]   We love you with all our heart.
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.900]   You are the reason that we live.
[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:55.740]   So we heed, we listen, we hear, we obey,
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:57.820]   we understand, we acknowledge you, Lord.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:01.580]   Help us, God, 'cause I know many of us
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:02.940]   are in times of difficulty,
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:06.340]   that they would be able to trust in you fully.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:10.180]   I pray, God, for those who are in time of plenty
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.980]   and that they're beginning to place their trust
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.700]   in those things,
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.980]   that you would not allow them, God, to stray.
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:19.780]   And, God, I strongly pray
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:22.740]   that if anyone in here has never placed their trust in you,
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:27.140]   Father, I pray that you would help them to remember
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.780]   that life is not promised,
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:31.860]   that tomorrow might not come.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:36.660]   Give them urgency, Lord,
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:40.700]   to know that the only life is in trusting you,
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:43.580]   that all things fall apart.
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.540]   So, Father, thank you.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:50.100]   For your great truths, in Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:53.820]   - Let us stand together for a little closing song.
