[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   All right, so we're looking at chapter 15 today.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.400]   It's only eight verses, but this is the last interlude before we get into chapter 16 where
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.600]   the bold judgment is going to come.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.760]   So I'm sure you, hopefully if you read through it or studied through it, you picked up the
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.200]   language that it's final, it's great, it's awesome.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.400]   And again, all of this to kind of prepare for the final judgment that's coming in the
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400]   bold judgment.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.680]   So let me pray for us and then we'll jump right in.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.760]   Okay.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.280]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for this evening and we thank you for your living word, especially
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.760]   as we've been studying through the book of revelations and all the things, Lord, that's
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.840]   happening around the world.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.720]   We ask Lord God that you give us soberness.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.000]   And even though we may live in safety and we don't have anything external, at least
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.680]   immediately Lord God, that we sense of, have a sense of urgency.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:09.640]   But we know Father God that our life is only a mist, that whether we die of natural causes
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.240]   or unnaturally early, we know Father God that ultimately that eternity is real, that we're
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.440]   only passing through.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.920]   So we pray for soberness.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.920]   We pray Father God that you would help us not to be entangled with civilian affairs,
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.400]   to really live Lord God with eternal mindset.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.360]   And we pray that your word would help us Lord to keep that in mind.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.120]   We thank you in Jesus name we pray.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.520]   Amen.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.720]   All right.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.320]   So our study this evening in chapter 15 is divided into three parts.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.200]   It's a heavenly sign, heavenly singers and heavenly temple.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.320]   So that's how your worksheet has been divided into three parts.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.000]   So the first part is just verse one and verse one is kind of an introduction to what's coming
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.840]   in verses two through verse eight.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.200]   And then the second scene, the heavenly singing is a vision of worship and is a very typical
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.680]   scene that we've seen.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.120]   And I mentioned I think last week that various parts of the book of revelations up to this
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.140]   point where there's intense judgment and then there's a break to kind of give a glimpse
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.140]   of heaven.
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.960]   And whenever they see this glimpse of heaven, they see worship taking place.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.400]   So that's the second scene.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.720]   And then the third scene is the preparation before the angels are sent out and judgment
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.760]   is poured out.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.360]   So God gives John a glimpse of the temple and the preparation that's taking place before
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.360]   they're sent out.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.360]   Okay.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.960]   So that's the three scenes that we're going to be looking at today.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:43.480]   So the first one, which we see in verse one, the heavenly sign.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.400]   And so first of all, a sign is not the reality, but something that points to reality.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.440]   And again, this is something that we may or may not know, but when we, when all the things
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.040]   that we've been studying in the scripture, especially as we've been looking at the book
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.920]   of revelation that mentions various signs and each one of these signs, basically it's
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.640]   to point to something.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.680]   As an example, if you're driving on a highway long distance and you see a sign that says,
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.680]   that shows you a picture of a gas station or a hotel or whatever it may be, that is
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.880]   a sign that there's a city coming down the street.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.880]   Right?
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.720]   And so you're to look for the exit, you have to look for whatever is coming.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.720]   So the whole purpose of the sign is to prepare you to point to something that is coming in
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.960]   the future.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.120]   So it starts out by saying, this is a sign, a great sign.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.800]   It's pointing to a great reality that's coming.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   Right?
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   So Jesus used that.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.560]   Okay, let me, let me go through this first.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.880]   For international standard Bible encyclopedia, the literal understanding of it is a mark
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.520]   by which persons or things are distinguished or to made known.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.520]   Right?
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.640]   It is something that points to something greater.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.520]   So Jesus oftentimes performed signs, he says, to show them who he was, that he is the Messiah.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.480]   The apostles, their works were accompanied by signs and miracles to point to the fact
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.540]   that they were specifically chosen by God to take the gospel.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.300]   So when it says there's a sign, it's to point to something.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.000]   So what we're seeing is not the reality in itself.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.600]   It's just a point to something that's happening.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   Okay?
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.120]   Again, I mentioned that Jesus performed many miracles, a sign to point to his identity,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.040]   that he's the Messiah.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.480]   So what John saw was not the reality, but the pointing to the reality that's about to
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.160]   take place.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.720]   And because this is the last sign of the last stage of God's wrath, it's described as a
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.520]   great and amazing sign.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.960]   So three separate places where in the book of Revelation where it says there's a sign
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.520]   that's taking place, and it's in chapter five, oh no, sorry, chapter 12.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   And the first sign, it was a sign of the woman.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.520]   Right?
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:15.680]   Remember when the woman gives birth to a son, and then the beast comes and tries to destroy
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   the son?
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.400]   They said the first sign was the woman.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.040]   And the second sign, if you guys remember, was the beast himself.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.120]   Right?
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.600]   So in other words, what are those signs?
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.080]   Those signs are given to us as an indicator that he's going to be very plain.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.040]   In other words, God has given specific markers so that the church, as we are anticipating
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.520]   his coming, that we would see.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.800]   So the first thing that happens is an intense persecution of God's children.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.800]   Right?
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.500]   So he says when that begins to increase, then look for the man of lawlessness to show up.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.360]   And then when he comes and it intensifies, and then he says the last and the great sign
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.320]   is what he's about to see here.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.320]   Right?
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.320]   So it doesn't mean that there are other things that aren't going to happen, but those are
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.960]   specific signs that God told us to look for.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   Right?
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.800]   Those are things that we ought to look for, and if you see those things happening, you
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.320]   know that the end time is coming.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.100]   So there's three specific indicators that are given to us.
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.200]   Chapter 12, verse 1.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.360]   Chapter 12, verse 3.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.820]   And then here in this passage, chapter 15.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.580]   The vision of the heavenly singer.
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.340]   John sees a vision of heaven, and it's much like the description that we see in chapter
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.340]   4 and 5.
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.980]   And if you remember chapter 4 and 5, before they get into the seal vision, chapter 4 and
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.300]   5 is a vision of God's throne.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.300]   Right?
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.660]   And then you have the four creatures there and the elders who are bowed down, and then
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.660]   you have the 144,000 and then the nations behind them worshiping God.
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:56.260]   So before this, what we look at is utter chaos is about to break out.
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.740]   John is given a glimpse of heaven.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.980]   So the chaos is not in heaven.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.240]   Chaos may be coming from heaven as a judgment, but it's not from heaven.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:11.320]   So in the same way, intense judgment is about to happen, but God gives John a glimpse of
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.860]   God's throne where worship is taking place.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.060]   And I mentioned this several times as we're going along, and this is not by accident.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.740]   I think God is doing this on purpose.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.820]   Imagine if you're reading this, the first generation people reading this, and I asked
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.780]   you this before, how would you have received this letter?
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:38.580]   What would have been your first response when you read all the judgments that were coming?
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.420]   Don't think about the theological answer.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.820]   Just what would you...
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.580]   If you read this late at night in the dark by yourself with nobody in the house, what
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.580]   would you feel?
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.580]   Right?
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.900]   Fear.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:01.100]   Most likely the first generation when they read this was probably trembling in fear because
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:06.420]   it says a third of the heavens, third of the sea, a third of mankind diseased, and all
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.660]   this stuff is taking place, and it's not just one time.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.420]   The people are going to beg for death, and they're not going to find death.
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.620]   And so this intense judgment that breaks out, so you could imagine what kind of fear must
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.460]   have fell upon even the church.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:25.980]   But in the midst of all this revelation, God gives a glimpse of heaven, that God is on
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.660]   his throne.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.900]   He's not out on the battlefield swinging at it, and there's a battle going on with Satan,
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.360]   and hopefully God wins.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.860]   That's not the scene that we see.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:41.660]   What we see is everything that is happening, all the judgments, people being wiped out,
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:47.700]   all of it is completely under God's sovereign control, and they're worshiping.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.620]   It's a scene of worship.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.620]   So there's this kind of...
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.300]   Remember we talked about that even this Sunday, the severity and the kindness of God, that
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.320]   even in the revelation we see both.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.740]   We see the severity of God as intense as mankind has ever seen it, but on the flip side of
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.140]   that, you see the kindness of God where people are falling down and worshiping him, following
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.020]   him everywhere he goes.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.580]   So that's the scene that John sees before we get to chapter 16.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:18.060]   We see a picture of heaven where they're all bowed down and singing worship to him.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.740]   John sees a vision of a sea of glass.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:24.700]   Some of you guys may remember that from chapter 4 and 6.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.260]   John again, when he...
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:32.220]   Sorry, 4, 6, where John sees a vision of heaven, and one of the things that he describes in
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:37.180]   heaven is the same scene, a sea of glass or crystal.
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:42.380]   So it says, "Before the throne, there was something like a sea of glass, like crystal."
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.180]   And it's not just in the book of Revelation.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.980]   In fact, other places, I didn't list all of them, but the other places where a sea of
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.700]   glass is described in heaven.
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.020]   So they get a glimpse of what heaven looks like and they see a sea of glass.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.020]   We see that with Moses in Exodus chapter 24, verse 10.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.260]   He said, "He saw God of Israel, and under his feet there appeared to be a pavement of
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.020]   sapphire as clear as the sky itself."
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.660]   So Moses is given a scene of where God dwells and he sees a similar picture.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:19.460]   And Ezekiel, oh sorry, Ezekiel 1, 22, the same scene is described.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:25.460]   Something like an expanse, like the awesome gleam of crystal.
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.060]   So what could that be a picture of?
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.460]   What would it signify?
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.860]   He describes it as glass.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.180]   Moses and Ezekiel describes it as crystal.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:43.220]   So when you think of glass or crystal, what's the first thing that comes into your mind?
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:50.540]   And why would that be a picture of heaven?
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.540]   Glass ceiling?
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.540]   Okay.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:09.540]   Sorry, I can't hear a word you're saying.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.540]   Okay.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.540]   Okay.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.540]   Interesting.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.540]   Okay.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.540]   That's a theory.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.540]   Okay.
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.540]   Anything else?
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.540]   Shiny?
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.540]   Something like spectacular?
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.540]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.540]   I don't have the right answer.
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.540]   I'm asking for your opinion.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.540]   I do have an opinion though.
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:47.540]   When I think of glass and why a picture of glass or crystal in heaven, again, this is
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:53.540]   not, I'm not telling you the right answer, but what it makes me think of is jewelry.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.540]   Right?
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:01.540]   And if you turn to Revelation chapter 21, it describes a new heaven and new earth.
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.540]   Okay.
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.540]   Chapter 21, verse 18 to 20.
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:13.540]   It says, "And the wall was built of jasper while the city was pure gold, clear as glass.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.540]   The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of jewel.
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.540]   The first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third a gate, the fourth emerald, the
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:27.540]   fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, seventh the crystallite, the eighth the barrel, the ninth
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.540]   topaz, and it goes on and on."
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.540]   So it describes all this jewelry.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.540]   Right?
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:39.540]   So I don't know if John was necessarily seeing jewelry, but definitely in other places, when
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.540]   John sees later on, he sees a clear picture and he actually describes jewelry.
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.540]   So again, it could be for other reasons, but the first thing that I think of is something
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.540]   sparkling and something spectacular.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:54.540]   So the initial picture that I showed you up there, I don't think it did it justice.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:59.540]   I was trying to look for something more majestic, but these are pictures that were drawn probably
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.540]   like 500 years ago.
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.540]   That's why nobody has rights for it and that's why we can use it.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.540]   Okay.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.540]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:12.540]   But I think what John is seeing in heaven, it is a similar picture that Ezekiel, that
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:19.540]   Moses saw, and Daniel, and so various people in the Bible, when they see a picture of heaven,
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:26.540]   typically we draw heaven as like meadows or oceans or mountains, but the one universal
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:32.540]   thing that we've seen over and over again is God on his throne, the four creatures, right?
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:39.540]   24 elders, angels, and crystal or glass, something shiny.
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.540]   That's the picture that we're shown.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.540]   Again, these are just signs.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.540]   It doesn't mean that when you go to heaven, you're going to be looking for glass, you
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:51.540]   know, but all of this points to something majestic, something royal, right?
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.540]   So that's what John sees.
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:01.540]   But the difference between the vision that Moses and Ezekiel saw is that it says, along
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:07.540]   with this crystal, this glass, it's mingled with fire.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.540]   Fire is often associated with God's judgment.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:18.540]   So, understandably, because this scene is going to prepare or take us to chapter 16
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.540]   where the bold judgment is coming.
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:25.540]   So, he sees a glimpse of heaven, but the picture that he sees of heaven, even though God is
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:31.540]   on the throne and people are worshiping him, when you see fire in the midst of that, something
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.540]   is about to happen, right?
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:40.540]   So in Hebrews chapter 10, 27, it says, "But the fearful expectation of judgment, a fury
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:45.540]   of fire that will consume the adversaries," and again, Hebrews 12, 29, our God is a consuming
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.540]   fire describing the judgment of God, the severity of God.
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.540]   So, again, the picture of heaven that we see is the same picture.
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.540]   There's nothing disturbed other than the fact that there's fire in its midst, pointing to
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:10.540]   the fact that judgment is a great, intense judgment is about to take place.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.540]   And then it says, "The ones who conquered the beast and its image and the number of
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.540]   its name were standing beside the sea of glass singing the song of Moses and the song of
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.540]   the lamb."
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.540]   So, again, John sees this picture, right?
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:29.540]   He sees a picture of shiny glass, angels about to give in the bold judgments, and then he
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:34.540]   sees all these redeemed who are standing there and singing songs, singing praises to God.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:41.540]   And what we have in verse 3 to 4, where it says, "Great and amazing are your deeds, O
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.540]   Lord God Almighty.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.540]   Just and true are your ways, O King of the nations.
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.540]   Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify your name?
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.540]   For you alone are holy.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.540]   All nations will come and worship you, for your righteous acts have been revealed."
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.540]   So, there's two places where it's revealed Moses' song and the lamb song.
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.540]   So, the first place is Exodus chapter 15, 1 through 21.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:07.540]   For the sake of time, we're not going to read that, but Exodus chapter 15, 1 through 21
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:13.540]   is basically a celebration song, a song of victory, where God delivers them from Egypt.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.540]   They cross over the Red Sea, and they're on the other side celebrating and praising God
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.540]   for his deliverance.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:25.540]   So, the song of Moses that he's referring to is a song of victory.
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:32.540]   So, a great intense judgment is about to come, and before it even happens, the people are
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.540]   there already singing and praising God for his victory, right?
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.540]   That's the scene that John is seeing.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.540]   Revelation 5, 9 through 14, the lamb's victory.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:48.540]   Again, it's to celebrate lamb's victory to ransom people for God.
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.540]   "From every tribe and language which gave the lamb the power to open a scroll that no
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.540]   one else could open."
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:59.540]   So, if you also remember when we're studying through Revelation 5, 9 through 14, it is
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:05.540]   the heavens breaking out in worship, the elders, the angels, the beasts, and they're all singing
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:10.540]   to God because they were weeping before because there was nobody worthy to be able to open
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.540]   the scroll, and they see the Lion of Judah coming, and they turn around, they see the
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:19.540]   Lamb of God, and he is able to open it up, and then as a result of him opening the scroll,
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.540]   they break out into this song.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:27.540]   So, again, the song of Moses and song of the lamb is a song of victory, praising God for
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.540]   his salvation, right?
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:34.540]   So, that's the typical scene that we see in heaven of worshiping God.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:40.540]   So, the content of worship is about salvation, victory, right?
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:48.540]   Even in the midst of chaos, and I think, you know, this is one of the questions that I
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:53.540]   asked for your discussion questions later, considering what happened in Las Vegas this
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:59.540]   week, you know, I mean, I think, understandably, the world is distraught, the fact that somebody
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:03.540]   was so deranged, and he was willing to kill that many people, and if he had a chance,
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.540]   he would have probably done more, and they're all trying to figure out what kind of evil
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.540]   was in a man like that that would just go out and kill, you know?
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.540]   So, everybody's looking into it, and anything they find, they say, "Oh, that's why.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.540]   That's why he's a lunatic.
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.540]   He's nothing like us," right?
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.540]   So, they're all searching and combing through his life and his background, his girlfriend,
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.540]   and what his motives are, because they're trying to figure out, well, what possible
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.540]   motive could he have to want to kill that many people, right?
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.540]   So, it's hard to understand.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:38.540]   All we know is it's as evil as we can possibly imagine, right?
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:44.540]   But in the midst of this, you know, there's theological questions that come up.
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.540]   Is God in that, or is that just purely just evil?
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.540]   Did God have nothing to do with that?
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.540]   And so, a lot of people who already have their hearts bent away from God will use that and
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.540]   say, "If God is so good, why did he allow that to happen?
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:03.540]   If God is so powerful, why does he allow him to do that kind of stuff?"
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.540]   Right?
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.540]   Now, we're shocked by it.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:12.540]   We're shocked by what that guy carried out, but see that in the context of the larger
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.540]   picture of what the Scripture says is going to happen at the end times, right?
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:23.540]   Persecution of Christians, wiping out of a third of mankind, disease, famine, right?
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:28.540]   So, we have to understand that in the context of the larger picture where John is seeing
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.540]   horrendous things, right?
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.540]   In the context of seeing this, I mean, think about it.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.540]   They're in such agony, they want to die.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.540]   They're not looking at people who are dying.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.540]   They're looking at people who want to die but can't die.
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.540]   They prefer to die.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:50.540]   John is seeing this as a vision, and yet when he looks up into heaven, God is on his throne
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:56.540]   being worshipped, and we see that scene over and over and over and over again, right?
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:01.540]   So, again, when we – again, I'm not trying to speak on the specific matter of what happened
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:09.540]   in Las Vegas, but as Christians, our perspective should be different than the world, right?
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.540]   Because we believe in a God who is absolutely sovereign.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:18.540]   I can't explain to you what is going on, what is in the mind of God, but what I do
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:24.540]   know is that our God is absolutely sovereign, that even in that, God is on his throne.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.540]   He is being worshipped.
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.540]   God is – like the whole world has been sitting on its edge, like how could this be?
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:31.540]   Who did that?
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.540]   You know, it kind of makes you feel unsafe.
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.540]   But our God is not, right?
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:42.540]   Nothing has changed for our God, whether it was last week or this week, and that's
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:47.540]   the scene that we see, that God shows John and to us over and over and over again that
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.540]   in the midst of this chaos, God is still on his throne, right?
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:55.540]   And that's the picture that we're seeing here with the heavenly singers.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:21:02.540]   The heavenly temple, Revelation 15, 5 through 8, the scripture tells us that the temple
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:07.540]   served as a copy of the true temple in heaven.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.540]   So, Hebrews chapter 4, 8, 4 to 6, right?
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.540]   So, he said what's happening in heaven is not a copy of what happened here.
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.540]   He says what happened here is a copy of what's happening in heaven.
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:21.540]   So, Hebrews 8, 4 to 6 says, "Now if we were on earth, he would not be a priest at
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.540]   all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.540]   They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things."
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.540]   So, all the priests and the sacrifices, all of these things are mimicking what's
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.540]   happening up in heaven.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:38.540]   "For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, 'See
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.540]   that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.'"
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.540]   Right?
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:44.540]   So, what did he see up in the mountain?
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.540]   A picture of heaven, right?
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.540]   "But as it is, Christ has obtained a ministry that is as much more excellent than
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:55.540]   the old, as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises."
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:01.540]   So, again, the vision that he's seeing in heaven is the reality, and what we have
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:06.540]   on earth is that it's a copy.
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.540]   "The fact that these angels with the seven plagues are in the sanctuary of the tent
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:16.540]   signifies that God is the direct agent of these judgments."
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.540]   Not that he wasn't sovereign before, but the fact that they're actually in the
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:26.540]   temple, and they're about to be sent out from the inner sanctuary of where God
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:30.540]   dwells, they're basically coming and they're hearing directly from God.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.540]   Right?
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:36.540]   So, God, the intense judgment that's about to be unleashed on mankind, God's hand
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.540]   is like, God is not far off kind of allowing it to happen.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:44.540]   God is the direct agent that is bringing upon this.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.540]   Okay?
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:52.540]   "The temple of the tent is specifically in reference to the inner part called the
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.540]   Holy of Holies."
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:58.540]   And the reason why they call that is because they say the tent of the
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:04.540]   tabernacle, the sanctuary of the tent, right, is literally referring to the inner
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.540]   circle, meaning the Holy of Holies.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:13.540]   So, he's not just in the temple, he's in the sacred chamber of the Holy of Holies,
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:18.540]   and they're giving instructions directly from God.
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.540]   So, other judgments are also God-ordained, but these angels are in direct
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.540]   communication with God.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:30.540]   So, the bowl judgment is intense, but part of the reason why it's intense is
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.540]   because God is no longer holding back.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.540]   Remember we talked about that, how up to this point where the judgment is coming,
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.540]   but after the judgment, there's always opportunity to repent, but this is the
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.540]   final judgment.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.540]   In other words, this judgment is not for the purpose of repentance.
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.540]   It's for retribution.
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.540]   That's the difference.
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.540]   And that's why it's called great and awesome judgment, because God is not
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.540]   holding anything back.
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.540]   Everything that he held back, all the wrath of God that's being stored up,
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:08.540]   now is going to be poured out on these final judgment.
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.540]   And even their clothing, it testifies to regal nature of their calling,
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.540]   that they're ordained by God.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:20.540]   The clothing itself signifies that they were sent out directly from God himself.
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:25.540]   One of the four living creatures that was introduced in Revelations 4,
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:31.540]   give the seven angels the seven golden bowls full of God's wrath, in verse 7.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.540]   So, these four creatures are very prominent.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:38.540]   They're introduced to us as guardians of the throne, and they appear all
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.540]   throughout the world.
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:43.540]   They're the guardians of the kingdom, and they're the guardians of the
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:44.540]   kingdom of God.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.540]   And they're the guardians of the kingdom of God.
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.540]   They're introduced to us as guardians of the throne, and they appear all
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:54.540]   throughout the book of Revelations, chapter 4, 6, 5, 6, 6, 1, 7, 11,
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.540]   and over and over again.
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:01.540]   So, we see two things that are universal in the throne of God is, again,
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:07.540]   we see this crystal or glass, something majestic, and also these four
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.540]   creatures, right?
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:14.540]   Those are common scenes that they see up in heaven.
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:20.540]   The bowl or the cup was often associated with God's wrath.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.540]   So, the seal, the seal judgment was something concealed that's opened up.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.540]   So, that's the first judgment, right, where God is withholding his judgment,
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.540]   and he's been holding it back, and it was contained inside the seal.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.540]   But when God begins his judgment, he breaks the seal, and one by one,
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.540]   it reveals what's been stored up.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:44.540]   The trumpet judgment, trumpet, again, to alarm, to basically warn the world
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.540]   that this is coming.
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.540]   So, you don't use the trumpet if you want to put people to sleep, right?
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.540]   You don't use the trumpet if people are about to rest.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.540]   You use the trumpet to get people's attention.
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.540]   So, the first, the seal judgment, is to break the seal, what was hidden
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.540]   to be revealed.
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.540]   The second judgment is to warn the world that this is happening.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:07.540]   But the final judgment is the outpouring of God's wrath, right,
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.540]   is the outpouring of God's wrath.
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.540]   There's nothing left that he's holding back, right?
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.540]   So, his wrath has been revealed.
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:25.540]   They've been warned, and then the real judgment is in the bowl judgments.
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.540]   That's why in Matthew 10:22, Jesus says, "Are you able to drink the cup
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.540]   that I am to drink?"
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.540]   And again, in Matthew 26, 39, "Let this cup pass from me, nevertheless not
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.540]   as I will, but as you will."
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.540]   And again, the word cup is used instead of the bowl, but a similar idea
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:48.540]   of something being poured out.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.540]   5.8, it says, "The golden bowls were full of incense, representing the prayers
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:56.540]   of the saints," in chapter 5, verse 8.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.540]   So, John seems to be making a correlation between the prayers of the saints
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.540]   with the final divine retribution.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.540]   So, God is acting upon the prayers of the saints.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:08.540]   So, remember in chapter 5, verse 8, who are these saints that was praying,
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.540]   and the bowl took up their prayer?
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.540]   Do you remember who they were?
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.540]   The martyrs, right?
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:30.540]   They were martyrs under the altar, and their prayers are taken up by the angels.
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:38.540]   So, 2 Thessalonians 1, 7-9, it says, "And to grant relief to you who are afflicted
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.540]   as well as to us, when the Lord is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.540]   in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God,
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.540]   and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.540]   They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.540]   of the Lord, and from the glory of his might."
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.540]   So, Paul himself warned that these things are going to take place.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.540]   So, what he says here is basically what we're seeing here in Revelation 15.
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:10.540]   And then the final...
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.540]   Can I go backwards?
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:22.540]   How do I get here?
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.540]   Oh, shoot. Okay, sorry.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.540]   I completely missed it.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:30.540]   All right, so the smoke.
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:35.540]   Smoke is often represented as a sign of God's majestic presence.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:41.540]   We see that in Exodus chapter, I think, 19, 18.
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.540]   "Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the Lord had descended on it with fire.
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:50.540]   The smoke of it went up with the smoke of the kiln, and the whole mountain trembled."
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.540]   And again, we see that in Isaiah 6, 3-4.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.540]   "And one called to another and said, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.540]   The whole earth is full of his glory.'
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.540]   And the foundations of the threshold shook at the voice of him who called,
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.540]   and the house was filled with smoke."
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.540]   So, the idea of the temple being filled with smoke, meaning that his glory,
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:11.540]   his full glory is present in the temple.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.540]   And it's there for a reason.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:18.540]   Obviously, we're talking about God's throne, but at the same time,
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.540]   it's like a preparation for something spectacular that's about to happen.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.540]   So, God is preparing himself, and he's getting the angels ready.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:31.540]   And so, the very last part of God's redemptive history is about to unfold.
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:38.540]   So, all of this is to kind of get us ready for chapter 16.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.540]   Again, the smoke.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.540]   "No one will be able to enter the temple until it is done,
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:47.540]   until the wrath of God is completely carried out."
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:52.540]   Now, you're going to notice, like considering this whole setup,
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:30:02.540]   chapter 14, 15, 13, 14, 15 was all a setup to get us to chapter 16.
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:07.540]   But when you get to chapter 16, you're going to notice it goes by pretty quick.
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.540]   Now, you would think that it would be long, elongated,
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.540]   like another 10 chapters, each chapter of judgment.
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.540]   But all of the judgment takes place in one chapter.
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.540]   It goes pretty quick.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:25.540]   But I don't want you to be fooled by the brevity of what's recorded.
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:30.540]   So, one of the questions that I ask, I think I asked this question.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.540]   A, if you look at your questions below, it says,
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:36.540]   "Carefully jot down the details of each of the seven bold judgments,
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.540]   and how do they compare with the seven seal judgments and the seven trumpet judgments?
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.540]   What are the similarities and the differences?"
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:49.540]   So, I want you guys to go back and review the content of these judgments
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.540]   and compare that to seal judgments.
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.540]   So, don't look at it just because it says--
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:57.540]   sometimes some of the judgments would only have two sentences on it.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.540]   There's not a lot of details on it.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.540]   So, in order to understand the gravity of--
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:06.540]   there's a reason why there's been a setup for three chapters,
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.540]   because God basically wants us to pay attention to this,
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.540]   because it is the great and awesome final judgment.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.540]   So, go back and take a little bit more time than you would normally
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.540]   to really understand what he's doing
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:25.540]   and what the major difference is between the two.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.540]   All right.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:34.540]   For discussion question number one--
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.540]   and I asked this already, but I want you guys to take some time to discuss.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.540]   Huh?
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:46.540]   Did I miss something?
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:32:00.540]   Oh, that's the last one?
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.540]   Okay. I feel like I said it.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:09.540]   So, you can just fill in the blanks.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.540]   So, again, all of this is a setup.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:14.540]   It says no one is able to enter the Holy of Holies.
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.540]   And right now, it's kind of like a command center
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:20.540]   where God is gearing up for the final stage.
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.540]   But when it's over, he said then they can enter,
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:33.540]   and the temple will again be a place of refuge and rest.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:36.540]   All right. So, the three questions that I have--
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.540]   "Considering the mass shooting in Las Vegas this week,
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:43.540]   how can we as Christians decipher between God's divine wrath versus man's evil?"
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.540]   You guys understand what I'm asking, right?
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.540]   Because when something like that happens,
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.540]   nobody argues that what he did was evil.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:58.540]   I don't think anybody can possibly justify that there was any good in what has happened.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.540]   But as Christians who believe in a sovereign God, how do we understand this?
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.540]   Is this completely independent from God?
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:07.540]   God just kind of like, "Ah, I don't see it." Right?
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.540]   How do we understand this?
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:13.540]   Is it safe to say that this was pure evil and God had nothing to do with it?
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.540]   Or do we attribute this within God's sovereign plan?
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:21.540]   How will you know if the tragedy the world will face in the end times
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:25.540]   is directed from God or from the beast rebellion against God?
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.540]   And what is the difference?
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.540]   Do you understand the question?
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:35.540]   I think it will be helpful for us, at least take some time to digest and discuss,
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.540]   based upon what we know of who God is and what is revealed to us,
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.540]   that we don't just jump on the bandwagon like the world
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.540]   and get shaken up when they get shaken up.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.540]   And say, "Oh, that's evil."
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.540]   "He did this because of this."
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:53.540]   We need to have a biblical perspective of what's happening.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.540]   Or else, the scripture says when the end time comes,
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.540]   we're going to be caught off guard like a thief in the night.
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.540]   Just like the world is.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.540]   So we are to be sober and to watch for the signs,
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.540]   watch for the things that the scripture says.
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.540]   So I thought it would be helpful for us to take some time to discuss,
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.540]   how do we digest this?
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:19.540]   How do we understand this in light of the bigger picture of what we see in scripture?
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:24.540]   What are the signs of the times that we are to watch for according to Matthew 24 specifically?
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.540]   So you're going to have to open up Matthew chapter 24,
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.540]   and there's a bunch of stuff that are written there,
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:34.540]   and say, "What are specific signs that we are told to watch for in Matthew 24?"
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:38.540]   What is the most obvious thing that you noticed recently about world events
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:42.540]   that may or may not be things we should pay attention to?
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:47.540]   And I'm not saying like, you know, I don't know,
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.540]   like specific things about Mark of the Beast
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:53.540]   and getting a computer chip in your hand is the Mark of the Beast.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.540]   I'm not talking about specific things.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:59.540]   I'm talking about generally when you compare it to what you see in Matthew 24,
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.540]   and it doesn't have to be wars.
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.540]   There's other things that are written in Matthew 24.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.540]   There are certain things that we ought to pay attention to.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.540]   And what are they specifically?
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.540]   Verse 3, number 3, "If victory in Christ is already ordained,
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:14.540]   what is the purpose of all the redemptive drama past, present, and future?"
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:19.540]   If what we read in the book of Revelation is a fact,
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:23.540]   not hope, but a fact that this is going to happen,
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.540]   what God has ordained, right, from the beginning,
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.540]   this is just telling us that this is what's going to happen.
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.540]   If that's the case, God has ordained it, He is sovereign, He is almighty, all-powerful,
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:38.540]   then why the drama of redemptive history, past, present, and future?
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:41.540]   You understand the question?
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:49.540]   Why does God allow mankind to experience all of this if the end is ordained?
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.540]   Why do you think God allows human sin and conflict to play out
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:56.540]   before He accomplishes the ultimate plan of redemption?
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:02.540]   So what we are studying is not fortune-telling.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.540]   Somebody didn't look way down into history and say,
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:08.540]   "Oh, maybe that's going to happen." He's predicting.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:14.540]   What we're studying is God telling His servants that this is going to happen.
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:18.540]   That's why they look up into heaven and all chaos is breaking out
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.540]   and they're singing praises of victory, right?
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.540]   Way before it even happens, way before the end happens.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:29.540]   They're already singing praises of victory of the Lamb.
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:33.540]   So the question is, in the context of what we know,
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.540]   if we're studying what has been ordained by God,
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:41.540]   why does He allow the redemptive history to run its course?
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.540]   What is the reason?
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.540]   These are some hard questions, so my guess is you're going to take a little bit longer today
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.540]   in your discussion, hopefully.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:57.540]   Let me pray for us and then I'll have you guys get into your groups.
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:04.540]   Gracious Father, we want to especially pray about all the world events that are taking place.
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:10.540]   We want to pray for our brothers and sisters around the world who are suffering for Your name.
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.540]   We pray that You will give them courage.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:19.540]   Help us, Lord God, not to live each day as if we have nothing to do with any of them.
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:23.540]   Help us to know, Lord God, that we are of the same family,
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.540]   that as they suffer, we suffer.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:29.540]   Help us to be vitally connected and concerned, Father God,
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.540]   that we would pray for them, support them as much as we can.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:36.540]   But we pray that You would give them courage, give them strength.
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.540]   And we pray, Father God, that in the midst of chaos,
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.540]   especially what we've seen this week,
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:45.540]   as the world is trying to figure out what was in this man,
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.540]   that he would do such a horrendous thing.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.540]   And I know that he is not the first,
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:55.540]   that our history, human history, is filled with horrendous things, Lord God,
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.540]   much greater than this.
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.540]   Help us, Lord God, to see from Your perspective
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.540]   that we are living in a fallen world.
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:08.540]   And as a result of that, we are seeing fallen things, Lord God, to its extreme.
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.540]   And we know, Father, that when the end comes,
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.540]   that all of this, Lord God, is going to seem trivial
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.540]   in light of the great judgment that's coming.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:21.540]   Help us to be sober, even in this context, Lord God.
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.540]   Help us to make sense of it biblically,
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.540]   and not to simply follow the pattern of this world.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.540]   I pray that You would give us soberness as a church,
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:34.540]   as we are constantly wrestling, Lord God, with entanglement, with foolish things.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.540]   Give us strength, Lord, that we do not have by ourselves,
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:43.540]   that Your Holy Spirit would grip our hearts and our minds so firmly, so tightly,
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:47.540]   that we would not be able to turn to anyone else but to You.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.540]   I pray that You would anoint the time that we have in our discussion.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.540]   May it be fruitful.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.540]   The thoughts that we have, may it be biblical.
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:59.540]   And I pray, Father, that it would cause us to be sober and in much prayer.
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:03.540]   So we entrust this time to You. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
