[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740]   (audio cuts out)
[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.240]   Attention up here.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.640]   Trust that you guys had some great conversation, right?
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.840]   This section of scripture is super rich.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.200]   And I know that a lot of the terminology
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.400]   is like some amazing, you know,
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.080]   like summaries of the gospel and our salvation.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.360]   So hope you guys had a great conversation.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.560]   Just got a quick like note.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.160]   If you guys can tell, like I'm trying to modify things
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.840]   that can be helpful.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.860]   One of the things I did was for the next study,
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.680]   what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna try to actually like,
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.480]   A, have the study questions for the next section
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600]   of the study, and next section's gonna be
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.920]   chapter one, verses 15 through 23.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.380]   It's a little bit longer.
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.900]   And then I'm gonna put the Bible verse there
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.160]   on the paper for you so that if you guys are like,
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.220]   just, you know, bringing a binder and then tracking along,
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.700]   then you guys can just do your study on here.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.840]   I'm still gonna have the text at the beginning,
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.680]   but I kinda realized like if we're expecting you
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.720]   to show up having work done,
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.680]   then putting the text, well, you know,
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.880]   at the beginning of this packet,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.640]   when you pick it up here when you arrive,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.740]   that doesn't make sense, right?
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.440]   So the text of the passage is going to be there
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.160]   on the packet at the end for you, okay?
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.280]   Also, I did wanna kinda make mention
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.980]   because sometimes theological concepts
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.360]   that are big come out.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.340]   If you notice on the last packet that I sent to you guys,
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.700]   I added like a very brief extra reading section
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.980]   about what predestination could be
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.060]   and how it fits the rest of biblical worldview,
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.380]   how it fits the doctrines of our depravity,
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.620]   how it fits the doctrines of salvation,
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.460]   and all that kinda stuff,
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.180]   how it fits the doctrine of salvation by grace alone.
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.060]   Election and all of that is in God's world,
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.700]   and so therefore it fits the rest
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.940]   of the biblical worldview, okay?
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.480]   So that was just a really brief thing
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.180]   that I attached to the end of the last packet.
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.760]   Okay, let's take a moment to pray
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.420]   and then jump into today's study.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.140]   Our Lord, God, we take a moment to really ask
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.260]   that your spirit will help us and guide us as we study,
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.120]   and what's more, Lord, that your truth and your word
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.380]   will affect every aspect of our thinking
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.180]   and then our emotions, and most importantly also,
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.980]   our desires.
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.620]   God, that as we look at the salvation
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.660]   that you have enacted across history,
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.460]   Lord, that our hearts would be most desiring
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.540]   of such a gracious God, such an intentional God,
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.580]   and our desires would be set upon you
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.780]   and the salvation that you give.
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.820]   And even though for many of us, Father God,
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.660]   we've been walking as a Christian for many years,
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.420]   may that longing for you, may that longing for eternity
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.420]   be all the more real as we walk with you, Lord.
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.500]   We thank you so much in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.780]   Okey dokey.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.620]   So we're gonna begin with a couple of just highlights
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.900]   from the last time.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.840]   I mentioned to you that this whole section
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.980]   is verse three through 14, one long just rhapsody,
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.100]   like it's a lyrical, there's a flow.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.760]   (phone buzzing)
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.460]   Good call, dude, thank you.
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.460]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.580]   For the viewers at home.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.780]   There we go, great.
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.620]   Okay.
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:45.540]   Okay, so then overall the impression that we get
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.980]   when we read through the passage is like,
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.340]   dang, what an amazing just explosion
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.460]   of praise and worship, right?
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.380]   And I gave you various like, I guess tips as to,
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.180]   man, this is such an amazing, just like,
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.460]   it's both beautiful, super articulate,
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.020]   and there is this like, kinda long windedness to it.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.420]   There is this repetitiveness, there are these terms
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.580]   where he can see the big picture
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.980]   and give you amazing summaries of huge thought
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.260]   into little, just like little summary phrases.
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.060]   But also there was something else that I found
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.540]   as I was studying was, you know how again,
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.500]   when you, if you speak a different language,
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.700]   you know that there are certain terms within your culture
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.620]   that hits a certain note, yes?
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.820]   And there are certain terms and idioms that you use
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.180]   in your culture that really does capture
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.620]   the emotions of it, right?
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.820]   And what I found was that as we go through
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.460]   this portion of scripture, there is actually a ton
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.060]   of variance between different translations.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.980]   Have you noticed that?
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.660]   If you compare the translation,
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.060]   there's like good amount of variance
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.620]   and what that was showing was that certain terms
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.740]   were hard to capture in one English word, yes?
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.780]   And so what you find is that kind of,
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.780]   man, this is just like depth of the expressions
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.460]   that Apostle Paul is giving within this.
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.660]   And the effect that we have then was
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.820]   there was an overwhelming, like the way I wanted to say it
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.060]   was we were just like drenched with the feelings
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.140]   that there was so many spiritual blessings
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.260]   of God in Christ, okay?
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.420]   And so I got a bunch of blanks for you there
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.460]   that you can fill in.
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.500]   The whole section is about the blessings,
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.820]   every spiritual blessings God has given us in Christ.
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.420]   And it's amazing how it just delineated,
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.620]   boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.340]   and there was this overwhelming feeling in that.
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.100]   And what's more, what was so clear was that the means
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.460]   to all of these blessings was in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.860]   So many times we saw in Christ,
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.860]   so many times we saw through Christ,
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.940]   through his blood, right?
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.460]   And what's more, I think what was pretty emphatic
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.820]   was that we were enamored by the manner of the grace,
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.260]   that it was so descriptive that his grace was freely given,
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.420]   it was lavished upon us, it was intentionally given, right?
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.500]   Those adverbs matter.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.180]   It shows us the manner by which he was showing his grace.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.820]   What's more, our minds were blown
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.260]   because we noticed that he repeated the idea
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.180]   there was a central focus in last paragraph,
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.500]   or at least the first portion of the paragraph,
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.940]   the extent of the grace.
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.700]   Extent meaning it wasn't five minutes ago he thought,
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.540]   you know what, be nice, right?
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.700]   It was prior to the foundation of the world
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.300]   he predestined us.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.540]   When you think about that kind of chronology,
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.780]   that should blow your mind
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.820]   because then the extent of his intentionality
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.220]   crossed far beyond what you and I can even fathom.
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.980]   And then what Apostle Paul was challenging us to do was,
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.220]   when you see this, when you see the means,
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.620]   the manner, the extent of his grace,
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.380]   you should bless the Lord, right?
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.660]   There was this implicit challenge for you
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.940]   to bless and praise God.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.700]   Now today, as we transition into that,
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.460]   here's what I'm gonna say.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.460]   This next section obviously has an ongoing list
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.640]   of the blessings of God,
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.420]   and they're gonna be magnanimous,
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.260]   they're gonna be amazing.
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.940]   But he's going to emphasize all the more
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.220]   that there is intentionality and purpose to all this, okay?
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.420]   Intentionality and purpose.
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.500]   So you're gonna see the repetition
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.140]   and the thoughts of purpose
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.260]   behind all the blessings that God gives, okay?
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.780]   Now, what I'd like to do then is read.
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.820]   I'll read for us starting from verse three.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.180]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.740]   who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.960]   in the heavenly places in Christ.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.280]   Just as he chose us in him before the foundation
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.680]   of the world, that we would be holy
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.320]   and blameless before him.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.080]   In love, he predestined us to adoption as sons
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.000]   through Jesus Christ to himself
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.680]   according to the kind intention of his will,
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.860]   to the praise of the glory of his grace,
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.980]   which he freely bestowed on us in the beloved.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.920]   In him, we have redemption through his blood,
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.920]   the forgiveness of our trespasses,
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   according to the riches of his grace,
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.720]   which he lavished on us.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.200]   In all wisdom and insight,
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.780]   he made known to us the mystery of his will,
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.440]   according to his kind intention,
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.840]   which he purposed in him,
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.560]   with a view to an administration suitable
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.880]   to the fullness of the times,
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.120]   that is, the summing up of all things in Christ,
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.720]   things in the heavens and things on the earth.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.840]   In him, also we have obtained an inheritance,
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.960]   having been predestined according to his purpose,
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.720]   who works all things after the counsel of his will,
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.400]   to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.680]   would be to the praise of his glory.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.800]   In him, you also, after listening to the message of truth,
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.920]   the gospel of your salvation,
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.540]   having also believed, you were sealed in him
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.480]   with the Holy Spirit of promise,
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.040]   who is given as a pledge of our inheritance,
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.960]   with a view to the redemption of God's own possession,
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   to the praise of his glory.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.960]   Man, what a, again, really, really rich,
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.600]   rich section of scripture,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.360]   summarizing just the massive, like, redemptive history,
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.400]   what God has been doing, what God is going to be doing,
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.560]   and all the blessings he has incurred on you, okay?
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.800]   Within this section, though,
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.600]   what I, as you guys know, what I like to do
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.760]   is always break things down into digestible sections.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.920]   I hope that if you're not able to, like,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.040]   diagram a sentence, 'cause you don't have to do that
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.040]   every single devotion that you do, right?
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.840]   But what you do is at least hit
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.640]   the main thrust of the thought, right?
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.840]   The main statement that God is giving you
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.360]   in every section of scripture, precept by precept.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.960]   And so when you look at this, right,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.240]   you're thinking, wow, what a mass of truth's coming at me.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.600]   And if you're reading just one cursory time,
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.860]   there's very little that's gonna stick.
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.080]   You might hit certain things like,
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.280]   whoa, he said to his glory many times.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.960]   So that'll stick, 'cause he repeats it a bunch.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.400]   But what we need to do is break it down just into sentences.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.960]   Now, here, the verses, okay,
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.460]   the verse, like, verse nine, verse 10, whatever,
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.400]   it kinda doesn't help. (laughs)
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.800]   Because it's like, it was placed
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.360]   into, like, weird settings, right?
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.040]   But what does help is, again,
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.560]   the formulation of the sentences that were there.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.520]   Now, these sentences are still long.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.200]   If you guys remember, I mentioned
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.360]   that starting from verse three to 14 in the Greek
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.120]   is actually one long run-on sentence,
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.600]   so it's just, like, hard, okay?
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.480]   However, there are markings that help us
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.900]   at least consolidate a thought.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.400]   And here, you notice, this is what I did.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.000]   Verse 8b to 10, the main concept there is,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.560]   he made known to us the mystery of his will.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.240]   Blessing one, boom.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.160]   Identify it, tag it.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.800]   Verse 11, he says, we have obtained an inheritance.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.260]   The blessing of inheritance is there.
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.400]   Tag it.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.900]   Verse 13, it says, you were sealed in him
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.740]   with the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.520]   Tag that and label it as a blessing.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.700]   For those of you guys looking at the,
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.400]   oh, hold on, looking at your packet,
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.360]   I summarize those things by saying
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.340]   we have three major blessings to deal with here, then.
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.140]   We have the blessing of revelation,
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.320]   okay, which is the first one, when he says,
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.940]   he made known to us the mystery of his will.
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.220]   In the second part, we have the blessing of inheritance.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.160]   We have obtained this inheritance from God.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.520]   And then, in verse 13, the blessing of the seal
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.480]   by the Spirit, by the Holy Spirit, okay,
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.560]   blessing of the seal.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.800]   That alone, for you, when you identify
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.520]   three major blessings from God,
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.080]   you could have a time of meditation
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.160]   and devotion to the Lord.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.640]   How have you blessed me in this way?
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.640]   How in the world is making known to me a mystery?
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.320]   If you tell me a secret, how is that a blessing to me?
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.080]   And then, as you think through that,
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.980]   that should really, really warm and encourage your heart.
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.080]   Okay?
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.360]   But for our sake, just like last time,
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.880]   we're gonna do a quick walkthrough of the observations
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.540]   and then draw some conclusions.
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.680]   First section, observations in section one,
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.880]   where we say, in all wisdom and insight,
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.240]   he made known to us the mystery of his will
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.240]   according to his kind intention which he purposed in him
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.080]   with a view to an administration suitable
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.000]   to the fullness of the times, that is,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.800]   the summing up of all things in Christ,
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.480]   things in the heavens, and things on the earth.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.520]   Again, when we look at it in paragraph form,
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.640]   it's a little tough because there's so much.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.340]   What I'll typically like to do
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.800]   is break it down into phrases.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.240]   Why?
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.240]   When you write your essays,
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.600]   you guys do the exact same thing.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.980]   Your paragraph has a thought.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.960]   Then, your sentence has a thought.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.160]   Then, each phrase of your sentence has a thought.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.040]   And all you're doing is making sure
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.720]   that you appreciate every element of the thought there.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.560]   Right?
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.840]   And truthfully speaking, let's say, for example,
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.020]   if I was preaching a sermon,
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.840]   and I know you guys don't preach sermons,
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.680]   however, the whole point of preaching the sermon
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.060]   is that there's exhortational points for you to take home.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.180]   Then, likewise, when you do your Bible study,
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.740]   each one of the phrases can be points for you to take home.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.800]   Think about this.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.120]   In all wisdom and insight, question one, who's wisdom?
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.440]   God's or yours?
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.440]   Is God giving you wisdom, or is he exercising his wisdom?
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.640]   All wisdom.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.460]   Hmm.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.520]   What kind of wisdom is included in all wisdom, right?
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.440]   And then, if I sat here and I said,
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.800]   you know, I can make a sermon out of this,
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.560]   can we take time to cross-reference
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.560]   every time the scripture was, wow,
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.040]   look at the wisdom of God.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.320]   Let's appreciate the wisdom and insight that God has.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.480]   Right?
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.920]   I could sit here and just dwell and meditate on one phrase.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.680]   What's more, him making known to us a mystery.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.700]   What is a mystery?
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.880]   Is it like, ooh, the unsolved mysteries of crime?
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.880]   Like, is it that kind of mystery?
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.400]   According to his kind intention,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.140]   I mean, we could sit and just reflect and meditate
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.480]   on the kindness of God
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.600]   and the intentionality he expresses, right?
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.920]   We would have to stop right there.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.760]   Right?
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.040]   And that's how some pastors preach one book for seven years.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.240]   Okay, because they stop at three phrases of the Bible.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.560]   And so, we recognize, I recognize, guys,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.960]   that sometimes even our effort
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.500]   to break down this Bible study into smaller verses,
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.200]   it's still tough, huh?
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.040]   Right?
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.040]   'Cause if you did it this way,
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.480]   it would take you even just an hour
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.240]   just to go through several verses.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.200]   However, I wanted to at least show you this
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.220]   because sometimes, as you regularly do Bible study,
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.480]   certain concepts were repeated,
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.520]   and you don't have to sit there
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.480]   and camp on every single word.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.240]   However, you should be able to notice,
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.280]   within this paragraph, what was the main point?
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.280]   I underlined he made known to us the mystery of his will,
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.740]   but why did I underline that?
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.560]   Right?
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.400]   Like, could I be wrong?
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.640]   You know, Pastor Mark, I think you're wrong, right?
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.880]   I think it's this last one
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.040]   where it's summing up all things in Christ.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.480]   How do I know?
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.800]   Well, this is where I think good inductive Bible study
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.000]   and observations is key.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.600]   The reason why I did this was because,
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.920]   remember one of the things I shared with you guys
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.480]   in terms of Bible study,
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.280]   is that not only is delineating
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.280]   the different phrases important,
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.400]   but seeing the relationship.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.240]   Right?
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.880]   And one of the key things I always like to show people
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.280]   is this.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.120]   How do you find the main thought
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.760]   in this huge list of various concepts?
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.800]   You make sure to tag the stand alone concept.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.480]   Meaning this, if I just read,
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.980]   in all wisdom and insight,
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.540]   can that stand alone as a sentence?
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.380]   No.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.460]   And as a matter of fact,
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.680]   it is just a pointer,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.480]   so I could actually even move it around.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.000]   I can move it around after.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.480]   I can move it around later on.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.320]   Right?
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.040]   It doesn't even have to be right there.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.920]   What's more, according to his kind intention,
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:51.880]   can that stand alone?
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.200]   You know exactly what I'm saying now.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.800]   The stand alone sentence is,
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.580]   he made known to us this mystery, period.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.040]   That could be a stand alone sentence
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.520]   that's giving you a complete thought,
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.920]   and everything is giving you additional information
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.700]   about his making known to you the mystery.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.400]   For those of you guys who like a visual,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.760]   boom, okay?
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.160]   You don't have to take a photo or whatever.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.080]   I'm just wanting to give you a visual
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.800]   that this is how I like to say,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.640]   you know what?
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.800]   What I need to take home is this incredible blessing
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.120]   he made known to me his thought.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.960]   He made known to me his intention,
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.480]   particularly his will,
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.400]   what he desired to accomplish,
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.560]   he revealed that to me.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.240]   He did that in his wisdom.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.200]   He did that because his heart's kind,
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.720]   and he did that with an administration,
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.740]   meaning a plan.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.760]   Does that make sense?
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.840]   And then all the different parts just describe it,
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.840]   and this is the way I map it out for you,
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.080]   that his intention was purposed in him, that is Christ,
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.400]   and one of you guys asked the question,
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.320]   man, is there a way, easy way,
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.360]   to differentiate the pronouns?
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.660]   Because there is him and he and him and he,
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.720]   and then it's like, is that God, is it Jesus?
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.440]   Is it God, is it Jesus, right?
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.400]   That part's hard.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.440]   Well, what I'm gonna say is,
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.040]   when you try to do a mapping of this way,
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.480]   of the pieces of the sentence,
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.640]   it's actually very helpful to try to identify
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.480]   who it's talking about,
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.080]   because typically, your pronoun only points
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.620]   to the immediate previous individual it's talking about.
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:19.460]   Okay?
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.000]   Now, here, again, you don't have to memorize
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.780]   all this kind of stuff,
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.520]   but the sentence just simply read, going back here,
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.520]   in all wisdom and insight,
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.600]   he made known to us the mystery of his will,
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.360]   according to his kind intention,
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.040]   which he purposed in him,
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.080]   with a view with an administration suitable
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.880]   to the fullness of the times,
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.760]   that is the summing up of all things in Christ,
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.160]   things in the heavens, and things on earth.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.600]   I mapped it out for you guys like this.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.340]   What, that little phrase that you see,
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.720]   what is it describing?
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.780]   Okay?
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.040]   For me, though, the way I like to see it is like this.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.440]   Why?
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.760]   Because it's very easy for you at home,
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.080]   it's hard for you to draw bubbles and lines,
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.680]   but it's very easy for you at home,
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.160]   on your computer, to take the paragraph and just hit enter.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.080]   Here's a break, poof, poof, poof, right?
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.200]   And then you have to do the hard work of asking yourself,
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.840]   what is this?
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.680]   In all wisdom and insight,
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.920]   I believe is more so the source of the plans of God.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.000]   That's God's wisdom, and his understanding,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.400]   as a source dictating what he's going to do.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.520]   And the blessing is the blessing of revelation
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.440]   that he made known to us this mystery.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.440]   He made known to us, essentially, his insight.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.640]   He made known to us his wisdom,
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.880]   according to the kind intention of his,
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.640]   to the kind intention which he purposed in him.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.480]   We talked about that last week.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.160]   Verse 10, with a view to an administration
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.380]   suitable to the fullness of times.
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.480]   The context of the revelation,
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.120]   he is looking at the administration.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.360]   And if you're doing good Bible study,
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.240]   you should be asking yourself the question,
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.060]   the administration, what is that?
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.440]   That would be to you a key term to look at.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.640]   And then he says, that is,
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.440]   okay, that is the summing up of all things in Christ.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.560]   If you notice earlier, I put an equal sign here.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.360]   Because of this section,
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.120]   what he does is he has a parallel thing.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.200]   This is the administration of the fullness of times.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.000]   What is it being defined?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   It's the summing up of all things in Christ.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.520]   Things in the heavens and things on the earth, okay?
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.600]   And you should be asking, man,
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.760]   this is kind of crazy, right?
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.600]   Like,
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.520]   what is it, like, there's so many questions to ask.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.080]   What is the summing up?
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.080]   What does that mean?
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.760]   Earlier again, what is the administration?
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.760]   And what's more, like,
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.320]   even the making known the mystery of his will,
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.520]   which he purposed in him,
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.760]   what does it mean to have purposed in him?
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.640]   And you could ask lots of questions.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.080]   If God had a certain will and it was purposed in him,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.560]   what does that mean that it's purposed in him?
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.520]   Does it mean that it was purposed through Jesus Christ?
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.880]   Was Jesus Christ, like, conferring and talking with God?
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.640]   Like, how is that all made out?
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.280]   'Cause we don't necessarily always talk like that, right?
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.560]   Okay, now, I know this part of it,
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.760]   it can get a little bit technical
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.860]   and it can get a bit tough to follow,
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.480]   but all I wanted to show was that
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.600]   these pieces of the sentence, to us,
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.900]   reveal very important things.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.400]   Why?
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.580]   Because, I wanna go back to earlier when I did this.
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.960]   Whoa, okay, right here.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.680]   What I shared with you was,
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.360]   by divvying up and sectioning off those sections
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.840]   of the passage of that sentence,
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.460]   we were able to identify that God is highlighting the means.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.380]   We were able to identify that God is highlighting the manner.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.920]   We were able to identify that God
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.900]   was highlighting the extent, right?
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.560]   And when you do that and you see the pattern,
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.240]   then all of a sudden, you're able to appreciate,
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.600]   like, oh my goodness, look at how much he's emphasizing
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.240]   the manner in which he's showing us his grace, okay?
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.880]   So going back to over here,
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.920]   we wanna do the same thing.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.960]   Okay, what I'm gonna do is move quickly
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.320]   to make observations on the next sections,
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.080]   and then we're gonna draw some conclusions, okay?
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.680]   That was all to show that each section was,
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.080]   you know, contributing and pointing to the main thought.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.500]   Okay, likewise here,
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.120]   let's walk through this section together.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.040]   It says, "In him also, we have obtained an inheritance,
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.600]   "having been predestined according to his purpose,
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.720]   "who works all things after the counsel of his will,
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.560]   "to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.760]   "would be to the praise of his glory."
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.760]   Okay, again, all I'm gonna do is section off the phrases.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.080]   The main thought here is we have obtained an inheritance,
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.680]   stand alone sentence,
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.160]   having been predestined according to his purpose,
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.840]   who works all things after the counsel of his will,
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.800]   to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.600]   would be to the praise of his glory.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.720]   Again, what I've done for you here,
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.760]   you can take a moment to start writing on the side
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.120]   of the, on your packet,
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.520]   where I have the kind of delineated thought,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.920]   some of the labels and the categories
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.920]   of what that phrase is.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.040]   "In him" is, again, repeating the means
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.380]   of all the blessings that come to us.
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.080]   If we're to receive an inheritance,
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.680]   it comes through Christ.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.040]   Having been predestined according to his purpose,
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.080]   who works all things after the counsel of his will.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.160]   Okay, if you're asking the question,
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.200]   according to his purpose, whose purpose?
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.240]   It's God's.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.840]   God, who works all things after the counsel of his will,
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.680]   highlighting this idea of the intentionality
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.520]   where God determines, where God purposes, and he works.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.160]   Okay, you see that progression there?
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.480]   And then what's more, what I highlighted for you is this.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.520]   There is this repetitive idea
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.600]   that there is an end to which God is working.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.320]   To the end, that we who were the first to hope in Christ
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.120]   would be to the praise of his glory.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.400]   And you notice that this concept of being
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.720]   to the praise of God's glory is repeated many times.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.640]   Okay, many, many times.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.960]   All right, I see some of you guys are still writing.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.160]   Take a moment to think about this,
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.840]   and then we're gonna draw some conclusions.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.680]   Okay.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.360]   Okay.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.920]   Oh, more arrows. (laughs)
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.040]   Okay, I'm just gonna speed through that section here.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.400]   Verse 13, "In him you also,
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.320]   "after listening to the message of truth,
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.200]   "the gospel of your salvation,
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.320]   "having also believed, you were sealed in him
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.200]   "with the Holy Spirit of promise,
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.200]   "who was given as a pledge of our inheritance
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   "with a view to the redemption of God's own possession,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.840]   "to the praise of his glory."
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.240]   Okay?
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.000]   Again, if you're looking just at paragraphs,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.480]   if I looked at this paragraph and the previous paragraph,
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.960]   it'd be very difficult for you
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.840]   to identify any kind of pattern.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.440]   You would see repetition of words,
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.920]   but difficulty to identify patterns.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.280]   Break it up into phrases again, okay?
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.280]   This part, I'm just highlighting for you,
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.360]   standalone sentence, "You were sealed in him."
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.600]   Every other sentence, whether it be,
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.360]   "After listening to the message of truth,
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.000]   "having also believed," those are all just phrases, right?
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.920]   Incomplete, partial thoughts, subordinate clauses.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.680]   Here, in him, same thing, the means.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.920]   But take a look at this.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.000]   After listening to the message of truth, okay?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.360]   The gospel of your salvation
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.200]   is just defining what that truth is.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.360]   It's a synonym saying,
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.480]   "Hey, the message of truth, it's the gospel.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.880]   "Having also believed,"
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.400]   notice how I labeled those conditions.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.400]   I believe one of you guys had a question,
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.840]   and that question was,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.200]   "Do you have to actually hear a message
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.600]   "in order to be saved,
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.160]   "or is there any instances of the Holy Spirit
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.160]   "coming into a person who hasn't heard?"
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.400]   Good question.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.160]   If this is a condition,
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.280]   you should be asking the question,
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.120]   "Is this a necessary condition?"
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:05.960]   Right?
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.160]   So, great question.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.480]   I'm just gonna say this.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.600]   Biblically speaking,
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.920]   the word of God is absolutely powerful, right?
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.640]   Scripture says, "Sanctify them in truth."
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.160]   Your word is truth.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.280]   Scripture says, "The word is a light.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.280]   "The word has precious life in it."
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.120]   Yes?
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.280]   How does one come to faith,
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.040]   which is absolutely necessary for salvation?
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.080]   Faith comes by hearing of the word of God, right?
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.320]   Is it absolutely necessary for an individual
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.520]   to hear the message of Christ's sacrifice and resurrection?
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.560]   Yes, because that's what they're gonna put their hope in.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.640]   That's what they're gonna put their trust on,
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.960]   and their faith and trust is what appropriates
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.360]   that union with Christ.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.560]   There is this popular thought that, like, right now,
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.800]   people who are maybe afar
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.920]   just randomly is gonna receive the Spirit.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.600]   Could it happen?
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.040]   Maybe you can possibly think, like,
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.440]   "I guess it could happen 'cause God could do anything."
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.920]   But God regularly works
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.000]   by the conditions of his own righteousness.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.840]   Yes?
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.920]   An individual who does not have, by faith,
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.280]   the salvific work of Christ,
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.480]   the substitutionary work of Christ applied to them,
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.800]   does not hold anything
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.800]   that dictates God's acceptance of them,
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.320]   meaning they don't have the righteous way for God to say,
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.760]   "And therefore, you're justified."
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.880]   Does that make sense?
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.680]   Okay, so if we're looking at this,
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.040]   if listening to the message
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.120]   and having believed our conditions,
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.880]   you could even say mandatory conditions, okay?
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.040]   The blessing, though, is you are sealed in him
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.280]   with the Holy Spirit of promise
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.120]   as a pledge of our inheritance.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.040]   And if you're doing, again, inductive study,
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.560]   you should be asking, "Man, if it's a promise,
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.600]   "if it's a seal, if it's a pledge,
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.960]   "you should be defining those terms.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.080]   "What is this?"
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.160]   Okay?
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.200]   All right.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.120]   And then it says, "With a view
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.120]   "to the redemption of God's own possession."
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.320]   I wrote context there, the redemption to God,
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.360]   but you could even argue
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.680]   that that's another purpose of the Lord,
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.480]   that God is, yes, seeking the praise of his glory,
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.200]   but he's also seeking his own possession.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.880]   If you recall, God says that he is going to present
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.080]   holy and blameless to himself.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.960]   It was an adoption to him, right?
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.400]   It was an adoption to him.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.800]   So there is this agenda of God
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.520]   to hold us as his precious possession.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.000]   Okay, let's take a moment to breathe.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.440]   Take a breather right there.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.640]   That process that we just did,
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.520]   it felt kinda long, yeah?
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.360]   It was kinda long.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.000]   It took us about 17 minutes or so.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.040]   Now, when you go home and do your Bible study,
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.640]   I don't know how many of you guys are doing that
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.000]   where you're trying to take a look at every phrase.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.360]   It can get monotonous,
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.360]   and you end up reading the passage multiple times.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.920]   But do you guys know that that kind of arduous work,
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.480]   that kind of tedious, repetitive work
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.160]   is absolutely necessary?
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.320]   Why?
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.200]   Because if you're going to observe the right pattern,
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.160]   if you're going to actually say,
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.760]   "Hey, this is the emphatic point,"
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.000]   you actually have to see why.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.280]   Because I looked at every other phrase,
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.480]   and they're conditional clauses.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.720]   They're subordinate clauses.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.200]   They're just incomplete thoughts.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.480]   The main point is this, right?
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.440]   You should be able to say that.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.960]   But what's more, from the fruit of the observation
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.160]   comes your conclusions, okay?
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.280]   Conclusion number one.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.480]   And here, we wanna take a moment to say,
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.320]   "Hey, did we really observe these things within the text?"
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.320]   And the answer is, clearly, we have some massive blessings.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.640]   But the way I would like to say this
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.000]   is the blessings that we see here,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.280]   combined with the blessings we saw earlier,
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.800]   summarize for us salvation
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.920]   is absolutely of our triune God, okay?
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.400]   Our Christian faith says the salvation we have
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:08.320]   is gifted to you and is not of yourself, right?
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.880]   It is not of your works,
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.200]   and no man will ever boast that I had a hand in it.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.800]   No man will ever boast that they had some peace.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.400]   They contributed to this with their own effort, right?
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.960]   And this portion of Scripture
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.040]   all the more emphatically shows that.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.200]   If we think about the many blessings that we saw,
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.160]   we saw previously before
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.640]   that we had the blessing of God choosing us
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.040]   and then intending us to be holy and blameless.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.360]   We saw the adoption.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.360]   We saw the redemption, the forgiveness.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.960]   And then today we're looking at
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.440]   making known to us the mystery, right?
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.000]   Making known to us the mystery.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.400]   You know what, did I?
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.000]   Oh no, okay, I'm getting there.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.840]   Sorry about that.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.920]   Making known to us the mystery.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.080]   Today we're talking about obtaining inheritance
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.480]   and the fact that we were sealed then by the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.120]   And you observe, God the Father is there in this passage
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.560]   as he is one choosing, as he is the one predestining.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.640]   You see Jesus Christ, who is the one
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.400]   through whom the redemption is coming,
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.720]   through whom the forgiveness is accomplished.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.960]   And then what's more, there is the mystery being shown
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.240]   that's in Christ, the obtaining of the inheritance
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.520]   that's absolutely in Christ,
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.680]   and then saying that you were sealed by the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.480]   Think about this.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.520]   From the back, middle, and end,
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.560]   the whole of salvation is of God.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.960]   Somebody in our group discussion asked this question.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.120]   Hypothetically speaking then,
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.560]   what if the Holy Spirit didn't seal you, right?
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.400]   Hypothetically speaking then,
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.080]   could any of those pieces not have been there?
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.240]   And what that points to is to say this,
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   the massive task of redeeming sinners from the pits of hell,
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.400]   taking sinners from the kingdom of darkness
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.960]   and transferring to the kingdom of light,
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.840]   it had to be of God, right?
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.600]   It absolutely had to be God.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.840]   And what we appreciate is that every element
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.360]   of our salvation, the depth of all that is needed,
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.880]   was accomplished by God, right?
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.440]   And in thinking about it even more,
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.760]   let's take a moment to dwell on this.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.480]   For us to know the mystery of God's will,
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.880]   let me ask you this question.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.600]   How is you getting some secret,
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.720]   like you learning about what God is doing,
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.200]   how is that a blessing to you?
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.360]   Have you thought about that?
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.400]   I mean, to a certain extent, if someone tells you like,
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.480]   ooh, I got a secret for you, and you're like,
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.680]   okay, tell me, and they're like, I've got this massive plan,
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:40.320]   and you're just kinda like, oh, cool.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.200]   But how is that a blessing to you, though?
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.280]   Does that benefit you in any way?
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.480]   But man, I want you to think about that.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.400]   For you to know the salvation of mankind,
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.200]   what kind of security that builds,
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.400]   for you to know what God is intending for you,
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.000]   what kind of solidarity,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.160]   what kind of firm footing you have, right?
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.600]   What a huge blessing for this lost generation
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.680]   who's out there searching for a purpose,
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.000]   out there confused as they're to that identity,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.440]   what kind of massive blessing would it be
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.120]   for you to have some clarity in your life?
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.200]   That's a huge blessing.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.520]   But I want you to think about it another way.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.280]   There's a passage I wanna highlight for you guys.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.840]   John chapter 15, verse 15 through 16.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.120]   Jesus says to his disciples,
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.800]   "No longer do I call you slaves,
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.280]   "for the slave does not know what his master is doing.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.440]   "But I have called you friends.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.240]   "For all things that I have heard from my Father,
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.040]   "I have made known to you."
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.320]   Do you understand what a massive,
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.120]   what a massive uplifting and raising that is for you
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.520]   when Christ is sharing with you all that he is,
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.160]   but that all that he is doing in this life?
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.160]   He is raising you.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.320]   I want you to think about this.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.240]   How many of you guys in your workplace
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.560]   saw a board meeting of CEOs, walked in,
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.840]   and was like, "Hey, what are you guys talking about?"
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.600]   Right, like, who does that?
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.240]   I mean, how many of you guys would just dare
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.440]   to go up to your president and just like,
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.400]   "You know what?
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.840]   "I would like to know what your plans are for me
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.560]   "and my job and my position.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.280]   "I wanna know your plans for him.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.240]   "I wanna know everything.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.120]   "Give it to me."
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.080]   They'd be like, "That's above your pay grade, man."
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.360]   Right, that's what they would say.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.480]   "It is absolutely above your grade."
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.600]   For God to say, "Let me tell you my will."
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.560]   That is grace upon you.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.520]   But think about this.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.120]   Scripture says when God reveals his truth to you,
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.680]   that is light.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.000]   You live in absolute ignorance.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.440]   I live in absolute ignorance.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.400]   And when the Lord reveals his plans,
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.600]   his goodwill, his redemptive plans,
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.200]   that is a tremendous blessing to every single one of us.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.840]   He is lifting us, he is raising us,
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:02.200]   and through his revelation, he is absolutely blessing us.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:06.040]   And just, again, every time I think about Bible study
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.320]   and all that kind of stuff, I just think of it as like,
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.880]   "This is a massive grace of God upon us."
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.040]   Amen?
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.760]   Okay, so we have to absolutely appreciate that.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.600]   And then the next part of it, quickly, he says,
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.240]   "And what's more, we have obtained an inheritance."
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.080]   Right?
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.200]   "We have obtained an inheritance."
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.960]   And remember, we repeatedly saw that the forgiveness,
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.600]   the redemption, and every single one of these blessings
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.040]   is through Christ.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.560]   And it has to be.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.400]   For think about what an inheritance is.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.480]   We don't have to go searching through like,
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.120]   "Oh, let me look up the lexicons and dictionaries for it."
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.360]   What is an inheritance?
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.640]   You know exactly what it is.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.480]   Whatever your father owns,
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.280]   whatever your mother owned comes down to you, right?
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.360]   Property, car, and you know,
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.080]   whether it be like bank accounts, it just comes to you.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.960]   Whatever the parents have set aside as a legacy
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.600]   for you to carry on, that's yours.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.000]   You know exactly what it is.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.200]   So then, immediately when you think inheritance,
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.960]   you should be thinking child of God.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.720]   You should be thinking heir.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:14.920]   You do not get to choose that all of a sudden,
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.160]   I'm gonna be your heir, right?
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.040]   That only comes by your union with Christ.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.040]   Scripture is so emphatic about this.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.160]   There's another passage I wanna highlight for you.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:28.120]   For all who are being led by the Spirit of God,
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.080]   these are the sons of God.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.160]   For you have not received the spirit of slavery
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.120]   leading to fear again,
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.160]   but you have received the spirit of adoption
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.920]   as sons by which we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.080]   The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.600]   that we are children of God,
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.440]   and if children, heirs also.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.160]   Heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.880]   You see that?
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.040]   So logically clear.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.080]   And so we think about this incredible blessing
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:02.960]   that Christ, who is the son of God,
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.160]   who genuinely pleases the Father,
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.040]   we share in his share.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.600]   That's just crazy, mind-blowing stuff.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.600]   And what's more, that inheritance,
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.280]   what's more, that promise,
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.680]   completely guaranteed by the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.400]   We are sealed in him, right?
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.880]   Think about that.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.440]   I mean, to have a kind of deposit,
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.200]   to have a kind of guarantee,
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.080]   for those of you guys who are doing word studies,
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.520]   again, when it has some repetition thoughts like that,
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.360]   where it says promise, seal, you know,
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.360]   that kind of stuff, a pledge,
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.440]   you should be studying those concepts.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.640]   And I wanna just make mention of the fact
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.520]   that the idea of seal is so rich.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.360]   Why?
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.040]   Because to seal it doesn't mean
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.640]   to take your Saran Wrap and make sure it's like,
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.280]   I'm saving this for later, you know?
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.000]   No, that's not the kind of seal we're talking about.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.360]   We're talking about a kind of seal where God says,
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.560]   this is my possession.
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.160]   I put my name on it, right?
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:07.040]   We're talking about a seal of ownership.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.000]   We're talking about a kind of seal
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.080]   where you identify and mark off, this is mine.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:17.000]   And it goes right in line with God is saying,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.280]   we are going to be to God, His own very precious possession.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.160]   And all of that is absolutely guaranteed
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.840]   because when it says pledge,
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.960]   it means the idea with any kind of merchant transaction.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.440]   If a transaction is made,
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.440]   there is a note that says, this deal is done, right?
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.640]   It's a permissory note.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.960]   And that's exactly what it is.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.720]   It delineates this deal is done, you are God's.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.840]   How rich, what an amazing passage.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.520]   And here, there's more to it.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.120]   It's in Corinthians chapter five,
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.240]   where it says, inasmuch as we having put it on,
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.640]   will not be found naked for indeed
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.280]   while we are in the tents, we groan being burdened
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.320]   because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.960]   so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.200]   Now, he who prepared us for this very purpose
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:09.520]   is God who gave us the spirit as a pledge.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.360]   Amen.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.720]   It's so crazy to think about the many ways
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.680]   that God has blessed us,
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.840]   and we're so encouraged by that.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.480]   Next, and we're gonna start,
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.280]   there's only just two more points to start wrapping up.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.880]   One of the conclusions we drew
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.960]   from looking at the observation of the passage
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.880]   was that there was incredible purpose
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.680]   in what God is doing, right?
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.680]   Incredible purpose in what God was doing.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:38.800]   We saw in previous passages that God is making us,
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.200]   transforming us to be holy and blameless,
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.920]   but there is more.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.840]   He was causing us to be that
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.040]   so that we would be to the glory of God, right?
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.040]   Think about this.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:56.200]   In our adoption, when we become precious children of God,
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.720]   that is to the glory of God.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.600]   It reveals his fatherly love.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.320]   In his sanctifying and in his teaching,
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.440]   in all the things that God is doing for us,
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.400]   it absolutely reveals the nature and character of God.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.160]   And then what's more, he says then that,
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.600]   so the point that I wanted to make there is
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.880]   we were made for God in his glory, right?
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.160]   When you think about your purpose,
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.200]   take a moment to think about this.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.680]   There are, for us, thoughts that we know ought to be,
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.360]   and then there are, for us, moments
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.760]   when we actually identify,
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.280]   these are the thoughts I currently have.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.080]   And a lot of times, we have this gap, yes?
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.000]   Every single one of us experiences this.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.600]   We know, if someone asks you, what's your purpose in life?
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.240]   You know what you should say,
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:49.720]   to enjoy God and glorify him forever, right?
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.120]   You know that ought to be.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:55.000]   I wanna give you a personal challenge here.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.480]   Whenever we think about this idea,
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.760]   like to the praise and majesty and glory of God, right?
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.520]   It sounds so majestic and big.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.000]   But the fact of the matter is, we would all agree,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.680]   that is the greatest purpose to live for.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:14.680]   And everything else is feeble, fleeting, and falls short,
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.480]   right?
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.840]   And that kind of conviction has to exist
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.840]   in every single one of us.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.080]   Okay, for the sake of time,
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.920]   when it comes to the summing up of all things in Christ,
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.800]   I exhort you, meditate on that for a while.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.560]   Next, okay? (laughs)
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:36.480]   Number three, we have to appreciate in this passage,
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.680]   God's will, right?
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.360]   How many times has God said,
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.200]   that all that he's doing is according to his will?
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.200]   How many times has he said,
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.920]   this is according to the riches of his grace?
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.960]   How many times has he said,
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.680]   this is according to his sight, his wisdom,
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:58.200]   his thoughts, his plans, his counsel, his mind?
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.600]   And this is pretty incredible, isn't it?
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:05.440]   That God would exercise that desire in his own heart,
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.680]   in the most informed, in the most insightful way.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.760]   And he's planned it in such incredible detail,
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.480]   exercising it exactly in accord with what he has planned.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:20.480]   And it's gonna come to fruition, because he's guaranteed it.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.040]   That's crazy, right?
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:28.880]   We can only hope to emulate that to a small degree.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.200]   What do I mean by that?
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.960]   I wish I would grow up, you know?
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.320]   Like, there are times when I wish I would behave
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:43.120]   out of and according to what's actually in my heart, right?
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:48.000]   I wish that I could be as intentional as this,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.200]   and I love the people around me.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.040]   I wish that I could emulate this,
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.040]   even to the smallest degree,
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.920]   that I would be operating by wisdom and insight,
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.720]   because I know something, right?
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.920]   Rather than typically saying, "Oopsie daisies," right?
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.000]   I want you to think about this.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.160]   You know, this past week, I was talking to Pastor Peter Chung.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.240]   You guys are praying for him.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.440]   I know you are.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.280]   I see it.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.560]   People are starting prayer lists.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.240]   People are starting ministry lists.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.080]   Yeah, Pastor Peter Chung,
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.760]   to be hit with the news that he has cancer,
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.160]   that's huge, right?
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.320]   That just kind of shakes you for a little bit.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.600]   But you guys know Pastor Peter Chung.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.680]   He's just gonna, with this big old dimple smile,
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.920]   and just be like, "This is great!"
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.000]   You know? (laughs)
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.320]   And he said some weird stuff.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.960]   He was like, "Oh, man, guys, this is great,
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   "because it's just all working out where this is treatable.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.640]   "My treatment's gonna be manageable."
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.400]   Sure enough, this week, he had his first rounds of chemo,
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.760]   and things like that, starting Tuesday.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.520]   He's had his medication, and all this kind of stuff.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.760]   But if you have talked to him, even just the shortest,
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.600]   you know what he'll say.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.720]   He's like, "You know, it's just crazy,
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.680]   "because God does not waste a thing!"
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.800]   Have you guys heard him say that?
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.640]   And he just repeated it.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.720]   On the pulpit, he says that.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.160]   When you talk to him in person, he says that.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.400]   And every time, we should be like,
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.040]   "Amen, it says so right here!"
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.440]   He's so wise, so intentional.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.860]   God does not waste a single thing.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.440]   It's absolutely true.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:17.280]   What confidence we build when we reflect
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.840]   on the truths that we see here.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.920]   That God has such intentionality
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.400]   and purpose behind everything.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.760]   He makes no mistakes.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.120]   Whereas I regularly say, "I didn't know, oopsie daisies.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.440]   "Oh my goodness, I could do so much better."
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.940]   God does not have moments when he says, "Whoops."
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.400]   But rather, everything he is working,
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.280]   he is working according to the wise counsel of his will.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.760]   And scripture says, in response, "Wow.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.620]   "When I look at your heavens, the works of your fingers,
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.520]   "the moon and the stars, which you have set in its place."
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.480]   Then rather than thinking like, "God, what are you doing?"
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.520]   Instead I think, "Oh my goodness, what is man
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.640]   "that you are even mindful of him?
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.880]   "The son of man that you should even care."
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.600]   Right?
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.400]   God in his immense wisdom is working out
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.780]   not just this meticulous, masterful plan, which it is,
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:18.560]   but he is working out the kind intention of his heart.
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.480]   Regularly, I think about the opposite.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.520]   If God did not have kind intentions in his heart,
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:29.040]   even if, even if you weren't a wretched sinner,
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.880]   even if, let's say, you had some wisdom in you
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.240]   and you had some goodness in you,
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.400]   if you asked the question, "God, tell me your will,"
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.680]   he could just look at you and say, "No."
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.000]   This is a conversation between me and my perfect son,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.400]   "See you later."
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.360]   Right?
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.780]   If you came up knocking on his door,
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.980]   "Please, I'm a good guy, give me your inheritance,"
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.000]   he could just look at you and say, "Are you crazy?"
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.840]   "No, you have absolutely no right to even ask me.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.560]   "How dare you ask me for my inheritance,
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.240]   "you selfish, jealous, wicked man."
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.600]   Yes?
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.240]   Can you promise me that you'll do me good
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.560]   and when you enact your kingdom
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.280]   and bring people into heaven, include me?
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.160]   No.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.380]   Why would I have to do anything for you?
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:21.600]   You see, when we think about this and just meditate,
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.960]   we recognize God is not just a mechanical being
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:29.680]   working out intricacies of his determined world.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.200]   God is working out his love.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.360]   And it's so deep and rich and full of blessings for us.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.240]   Amen?
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.080]   Let's pray.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:47.000]   Heavenly Father, I do pray,
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.920]   and I'll let the many saints of old ask this question,
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.680]   Lord, help us to behold marvelous
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.400]   and wonderful things in your word.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.880]   And God, today we recognize, God, that there are,
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.720]   just, you can call them blessings,
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:05.280]   massive gifts of grace, mercies, and privileges
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:10.080]   that only come by your gracious offer of salvation.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.500]   And God, we wanna thank you so much.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.100]   And it is sometimes weird to think
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.920]   that it's as easy as believing it,
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.080]   just taking your word for what it is and then trusting it.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.340]   It seems so easy.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:25.280]   But we recognize, Lord, that's how it has to be.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.220]   For God, we know that in of ourselves,
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:31.760]   this plan, this salvation plan would not be our idea.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.760]   So Father, thank you so much
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.380]   that you enacted it according to your kindness,
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:38.980]   that you prepared the way,
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.960]   that you took the time for the fullness to come.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.760]   And God, what's more, that your son,
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:48.540]   God, according to his work, has made it all accomplished.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:51.820]   So Father, we wanna take moments to thank you.
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.700]   I pray that the meditation of our heart,
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.660]   I pray that our faith would be pleasing to you.
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:58.720]   Lord, we wanna just lift you up.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.300]   We want to praise you and bless you.
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.940]   It's in Christ, let me pray, amen.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.540]   Thank you.
