[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:37.100]   - Good morning, Church family.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.180]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.340]   Psalm 86, verse 11, it reads,
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.420]   "Teach me your way, O Lord,
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.480]   "that I may walk in your truth,
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.980]   "unite my heart to fear your name."
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.760]   Perhaps we come today with a lot of things
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.140]   going on in our lives.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.980]   Perhaps we have a lot of things on our mind,
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.100]   and perhaps a lot of things competing for our affections
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.600]   and for our worship.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.600]   But may it be our prayer today as we begin our service
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.020]   that we would desire to have a focus
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.440]   and undivided heart and devotion to our Lord.

[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:24.020]   Let's sing, "Teach me your way."

[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.340]   and welcome to Green Community Church.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.840]   First of all, our family ministry
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.920]   has a Christmas gathering here today after service.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.420]   So if some of you guys can please help out
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.560]   after the second service to clear out all the chairs
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.160]   and then we're gonna be setting up tables here.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.060]   I think the instructions are gonna be on the screen.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.800]   So at least, even if you're not part of the family ministry,
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.920]   if you guys can help us out
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.080]   to at least move all the chairs out.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.260]   And so we'll set up the tables in here.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.600]   And then I've been informed
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.920]   that there's so many families who have sick children
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.420]   or they're not able to make it.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.320]   And even if you haven't signed up,
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.600]   they said it's open for you to sign up today.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.120]   So because there's some space open
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.740]   because some people are sick.
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.840]   So you can go outside and then there's a table outside.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.680]   So if you haven't signed up, you can sign up
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.020]   and you're more than welcome to join us today.
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:25.680]   See, oh, yeah.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.680]   So as you're coming in,
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.960]   you should have received one of these cards
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.780]   as a reminder and an invitation for the Christmas service
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.580]   that we're having on Christmas Eve on the 24th.
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.900]   This is for you so that you can be intentional
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.500]   about Christmas coming.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.100]   And every year when we have Christmas,
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.340]   we try to encourage you guys to use that time wisely.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.140]   There's people who are more willing to come to church
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.580]   at Christmas, during Christmas time than any other time.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.940]   And so I wanna encourage you,
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.400]   highly encourage you not to spend this Christmas
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.380]   like any other week or just like the rest of the world,
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.460]   just busy collecting gifts and having family gatherings,
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.180]   knowing that the secular world is singing Christmas songs,
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.180]   singing Christmas songs about Christ and what he's done
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.980]   without really thinking through
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.340]   what it is that they're celebrating.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.020]   So it's a great opportunity
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.380]   for you to be able to share the gospel.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.740]   So as you're inviting them to come to church,
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.500]   at the least, to have a conversation with them.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.600]   And so why, do you understand what Christmas is
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.060]   and why Christians make a big deal about this?
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.440]   And so if they come, that's great.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.800]   So if they come, they will be able to present the gospel,
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.160]   the meaning of Christmas to them.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.760]   And if not, at least you're able to share the gospel,
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.320]   at least share with them the purpose
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.120]   and spend this Christmas season purposefully.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.000]   So this is there for you, keep it in your Bible
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.240]   and you can take more than you want.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.580]   If we run out, we can always print more.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.240]   So make sure you grab plenty of these.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.240]   So just even if it's just a pass out
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.080]   and invite them to come to the service.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.280]   So again, please take this with you.
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.620]   The college study hall, it's end of the year already.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.520]   And so starting from today, after our Christmas party,
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.380]   and so at three or four o'clock,
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.840]   so we need the cafe and the other side cleared out
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.120]   because the children are gonna be watching in that area.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.920]   So the cafe is gonna be closed.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.400]   You can go grab your coffee,
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.600]   but please don't linger around there
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.480]   because they're gonna clear that space out
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.500]   so that the children can be watched there.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.680]   And the college students are gonna be having,
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.640]   it's at 6 p.m., but at three to four o'clock,
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.640]   we should be done.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.560]   So if you guys wanted to come and stay in there.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.440]   And if you wanna bring food,
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.200]   those of you who signed up for it,
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.000]   just bring it and then you can drop it off over there.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.760]   And even if you didn't sign up,
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.400]   you wanna bring some food or snacks or whatever
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.760]   to encourage our college students in their study hall,
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.160]   just bring it and drop it off there
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.240]   and then the students will be able to enjoy that.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.160]   And that's today, tomorrow, and Tuesday.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.320]   Let me see, New Year's Eve ping pong.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.960]   If you are planning to play the ping pong,
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.400]   please sign up for that as soon as possible
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.780]   so they can organize it.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.800]   And the cost of that is $5.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.960]   I think you can sign up by yourself
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.160]   or you can sign up together with other people.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.140]   Your skill level doesn't have to be that great.
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.880]   You just won't win.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.080]   But you're more than welcome to come and play, okay?
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.680]   And just enjoy the fellowship
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.000]   before we have our New Year's Eve service, okay?
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.600]   There's a couple more announcements.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.100]   Bible Lab.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.000]   If you are somewhat new to the church
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.360]   or you've been to church and you want to learn more
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.740]   about how to do inductive Bible study,
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.900]   on January 21st, 27th, and February 4th,
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.720]   there is a Bible Lab where Pastor Mark
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.760]   will be going over how to do inductive Bible study,
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.240]   how to ask questions, how to get insights.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.520]   So that'll help you in the weekday Bible study,
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.000]   whether you're in home group or whether you're
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.640]   in a small group.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.680]   So that will be taking place on January 21st.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.000]   So this Wednesday, or this week is our last week
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.660]   of regular Bible study, and then there's gonna be
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.480]   about seven or eight week break in between.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.440]   But we do need you to sign up for the next session
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.200]   so that we can know and prepare enough small groups,
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.960]   enough Bible study, enough home groups.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.280]   So even though you are in a home group
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.440]   and you know you're gonna come,
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.560]   and you told your home group or small group leaders,
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.280]   please sign up for it as soon as possible
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.800]   so that we can better organize that together, okay?
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.000]   And then Living Well Baby Bottle Drive.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.080]   Today is the day that you need to turn it in.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.860]   So if you brought it, please turn that in.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.660]   For whatever the reason, if you forgot it,
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.060]   please let them know, 'cause today is the last day
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:30.900]   to turn that in.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.040]   And then one last thing.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.100]   On Christmas, on the day of Christmas,
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.380]   we're gonna be having our Lottie Moon
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.860]   Christmas Mission Offering.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.860]   This is something that we do every year.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.860]   And so we collect that and we hand it over
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.620]   to our International Mission Board,
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.820]   and they'll use that to support missionaries
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.140]   who are overseas.
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.420]   And so every year, we ask you to be prayerful about that
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.540]   at the end of the year.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.480]   If you have offering you wanna give for that,
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.800]   please be prayerful about it.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.320]   And then when you give it, just mark it
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.920]   that this is for the Lottie Moon Mission Fund,
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.800]   and then all of that will be sent over
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.680]   as soon as we receive it.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.000]   So we'll remind you another couple weeks,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.600]   but it is every Christmas,
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   we ask that you would be prayerful about that.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.920]   And then when you give your offering,
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.360]   make sure you distinguish that from the regular offering,
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.100]   because that will be going to them, okay?
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.820]   All right, I think that's it for the announcements.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.080]   After I pray for the offering,
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.700]   our brother Michael Lee's gonna come up
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.540]   and he's gonna give his testimony and be baptized.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.020]   For those of you who have a physical offering
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.100]   that you wanna give, again,
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.860]   our box is in the back as you're exiting, okay?
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.960]   All right, let's pray.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:42.900]   Father, we thank you so much for constant grace,
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.960]   constant patience over our lives.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.400]   Lord, you know how easily we get entangled
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.680]   with the things, Lord, of this world.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.100]   I pray that each and every Sunday
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.500]   that you would remind us, Lord God,
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.580]   that we are not citizens of this world,
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.980]   but we have a home, Lord, that is waiting for us.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.700]   Help us to live as aliens and strangers
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.900]   who are just sojourning,
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.720]   that we would not be overly focused and concerned
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.780]   for temporary things, Lord God, of this world.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.900]   We pray that our service would be a reminder of who you are,
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.660]   that you'd open our eyes to see the glory
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.180]   of the gospel that you've given us.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.140]   I pray that you would bless this offering,
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.380]   make it be given to you intentionally,
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.940]   joyfully, bountifully, Lord God,
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.540]   that it may be multiplied for your use in your kingdom.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.500]   (gentle piano music)

[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:25.300]   - Let us all rise as we continue our worship.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.340]   But before we do, if we could spend a few moments
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.180]   just greeting the neighbors around us.

[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:45.400]   - Morning church, my name is Michael
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.080]   and this is my testimony.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:54.320]   I'm grateful to have been blessed with two loving parents
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.560]   who are of the faith
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.720]   and who raised me in a Christian household.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.080]   I grew up going to various churches in LA.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.380]   Our family's movement from one to another
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.520]   being based on my dad's discernment
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.820]   as to whether that church adhered to the word.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.720]   Because I saw from a young age
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.400]   how scripture guided my dad in all his decisions,
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.480]   I assumed that I would inherit that wisdom
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.760]   and so inherit the faith.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.860]   Because of this, I thought genuinely that I was a believer,
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.200]   but in hindsight, I know that I believed
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.160]   only in the idea of God
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.520]   and that not for who he was,
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.760]   but for what I thought I could gain from him.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.800]   As I grew, avenues for pride naturally
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.360]   became more and more appealing.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:45.000]   And so because of this, I chased after satisfaction
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.840]   and temporary joy through worldly pursuits,
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.780]   believing in God because I thought
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.400]   he might bless me with success.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.800]   Philippians 4.13 says, "I can do all things
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.440]   "through him who strengthens me."
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.900]   We all know this verse very well
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.600]   and I'd quote this verse before swim meets,
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.080]   not with a heart of contentment
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.440]   as the Apostle Paul had intended,
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.400]   but with a depraved mind so focused on exalting myself.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.760]   I became so infatuated with this pride
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.400]   that at some point I no longer wanted
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.680]   anything to do with God.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.020]   In my mind, I no longer needed him.
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:24.520]   Only when I could not be satisfied with my performance
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.640]   did I turn to him,
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.200]   reading a chapter of my dusty Bible
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.260]   in hopes that he'd be pleased and so bless me
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:31.900]   with what I wanted of this world.
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.940]   Despite years of my unfaithfulness, he remained faithful.
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.620]   Though it seemed then like failure,
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.420]   he stripped me of the major sources of pride in my life.
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.100]   And though I was defeated then,
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.940]   I saw in that Christ's victory already won for me.
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.940]   And by his grace, he led me to a church
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.180]   where his word would have its way in my heart,
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.000]   not my own.
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.500]   Galatians 6:14 reads,
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.300]   "But may it never be that I would boast
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.900]   "except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.440]   "through which the world has been crucified to me
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.580]   "and I to the world.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.080]   "Though this world yet has its appeals,
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.840]   "my hope is in Christ who gave his life for me,
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.660]   "in whom I have satisfaction and joy eternal."
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.860]   Thank you.
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.020]   (audience applauding)
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:40.460]   - Michael, do you understand when you're going into the water
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.580]   you're being united by death,
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.420]   and when you come out,
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.940]   you're being united with the resurrected life?
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.060]   God's writing name of the Father,
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.220]   Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:56.280]   (audience applauding)
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:09.180]   - All right, thank you, college students,
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.500]   for coming to support.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.980]   And thank you for that encouraging testimony.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.340]   If you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:20.260]   to Luke chapter seven, verses one through 10.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.040]   Luke chapter seven, verses one through 10.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.420]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:32.540]   When he had completed all his discourse
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.680]   in the hearing of the people,
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.580]   he went to Capernaum,
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.180]   and a centurion slave,
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.660]   who was highly regarded by him,
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.040]   was sick and about to die.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.340]   When he heard about Jesus,
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.140]   he sent some Jewish elders
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.500]   asking him to come and save the life of his slave.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.600]   When they came to Jesus,
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.780]   they earnestly implored him,
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.380]   saying, "He is worthy for you to grant this to him,
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.600]   "for he loves our nation,
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.020]   "and it was he who built us our synagogue."
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.100]   Now Jesus started on his way with them,
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.140]   and when he was not far from the house,
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.280]   the centurion sent friends,
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.840]   saying to him, "Lord, do not trouble yourself further,
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.060]   "for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.340]   "For this reason, I did not even consider myself
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.580]   "worthy to come to you,
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.860]   "but just say the word,
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.200]   "and my servant will be healed.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.220]   "For also am I a man placed under authority,
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.460]   "with soldiers under me.
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.740]   "And I say to this one, go, and he goes,
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.980]   "and to another, come, and he comes.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.340]   "And to my slave, do this, and he does it."
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.580]   Now when Jesus heard this,
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.660]   he marveled at him,
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.660]   and turned and said to the crowd that was following him,
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.380]   "I say to you, not even in Israel
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.780]   "have I found such great faith."
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.980]   When those who had been sent returned to the house,
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.980]   they found the slave in good health.
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:42.820]   Let's pray.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.060]   (coughing)
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.540]   Father, we thank you so much
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.800]   for your constant grace and love that you pour upon us.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.840]   You are a God truly worthy of our praise.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.180]   I pray that your word would speak to us
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.980]   by the power of your Holy Spirit.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.220]   I pray that you would grip our minds,
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.300]   our hearts, our very lives, Lord God,
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.840]   that we would desire with all our being
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.200]   to honor you, to love you, to worship you.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:18.600]   May his name, and his name alone be magnified.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.300]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:25.200]   May I ask you a question this morning?
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.360]   When was the last time you were amazed at something?
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.600]   Like amazed at something?
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.680]   I know at our church I am known as a hater.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:39.000]   Pastor Peter, don't hype things to Pastor Peter
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.800]   because he's gonna knock it down.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.640]   And it is true, right?
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.720]   It's 'cause I don't get impressed easily.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.360]   So when I, where I see reviews of 4.5 star, five star,
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.840]   and say, oh, you gotta try this, blah, blah, blah.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.920]   My first reaction isn't, oh, I wanna go see it.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.520]   My first reaction is, yeah, right, right?
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.800]   And I notice that the older we get it,
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.400]   that we have a tendency to do that.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.620]   So when, in our Jubilee Fellowship,
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:09.160]   it's very difficult, right, to get them excited.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.720]   Because the longer you live, you've seen everything,
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.320]   and it's like, wow, you've tasted everything.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.200]   And so very rarely you experience something,
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.280]   it's like, wow, this is so awesome.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.280]   Or you've been somewhere, it's like,
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.840]   oh, I haven't seen that before.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.800]   You know, the younger you are,
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.440]   the more easily amused or amazed you get.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.120]   Like you can just go peek-a-boo,
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.600]   and then they're like, whoa.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.920]   Right, I got a magic trick, look at this, right?
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:35.300]   But the older we get, the harder it is to impress.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.320]   Because we just experience, we've experienced a lot of things,
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.960]   seen a lot of things, right?
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:44.480]   I'm saying all of this to introduce the sermon this morning
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.480]   'cause something happens in this story that amazes Jesus.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.760]   I mean, if it's hard for older people
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.080]   to get amazed by something,
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:58.080]   imagine what was it about this man that amazed Jesus?
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.600]   Now, this is not a statement
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.380]   that we see commonly in the New Testament.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.320]   You don't see Jesus like surprised or amazed.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.720]   In fact, he knew.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.620]   When people were coming to him,
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.960]   he knew what was in their heart.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.440]   So he wasn't amazed, oh, it's such a large crowd coming,
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.240]   we wanna make you king.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.120]   Jesus was not amazed with that.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.160]   He would look at that and say,
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.800]   he knew what was in their heart.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.440]   You're coming to me because you ate,
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.320]   and you want more of it, you don't know who I am.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.080]   So it is not common that we see
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.600]   that Jesus is almost surprised, right?
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   Surprised and amazed by the reaction of this centurion.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.980]   So the question that we need to ask ourselves
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.460]   is that if this is this rare,
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:42.180]   and it surprises and amazes our Savior,
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:46.940]   what was it about him that caused our Savior to be amazed?
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.540]   So this morning, I wanna look at about four,
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:55.540]   or I think it's about, yeah, four things about this man.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.540]   And obviously, the conclusion is going to be at the tail end
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.700]   but it'll kind of give us the context
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.080]   in which it'll help us to understand who this man is
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.660]   and what was it, and what was it about this encounter
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.460]   that caused Jesus to be amazed?
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.580]   First thing that we need to understand
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.740]   about the centurion was he was a very accomplished man.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:17.940]   Even in our military, you hear stories about people
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.060]   who became an officer because they went to a certain school
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.260]   or they had better education, or after a certain point,
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.840]   there's a lot of political things going on.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.000]   That's what I hear from lifetime soldiers,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.160]   and so they get promoted at a certain point
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.400]   because of these connections.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.320]   And then you have some soldiers who come in as privates
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.320]   and they do the hard work.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.620]   They grind it out, they're at war,
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.080]   they've been shot at, almost risked their lives,
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.720]   and so they get commendations.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.360]   And so they come up the rank as a result
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.340]   of getting their hands dirty and risking their lives.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.200]   Well, a centurion was one of those people.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.920]   Centurion was not a soldier because he was connected,
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:01.560]   and typically, they were very uneducated people
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.160]   that came up the ranks because during the midst of battle,
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:09.000]   that he showed a certain level of heroism.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.720]   And so this is a man's man.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.440]   This is not a guy who was politically connected
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.480]   that came up the ranks.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.320]   This is a guy that if you were to ask the soldiers,
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.720]   who would you follow, and this is that guy.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.160]   So typically, a centurion was a guy who came up the ranks
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.600]   because of what he did in battle.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.160]   So that already kind of gives you a picture
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.680]   of who this man is.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.920]   So this was not a man who just held onto a title.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.160]   This is a man who was overseeing 100 soldiers,
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.200]   and the 100 soldiers really looked up to him, respected him.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.240]   He had 100 guys who, out of their ranks,
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.720]   became the cream of the crop, right?
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.660]   So he was either brave or he risked his life
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.700]   or he got hurt or whatever the reason.
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.480]   He was a very accomplished man.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:57.400]   In the Roman soldiers, in their system,
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.600]   they really wanted to encourage bravery
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.980]   so when somebody would come up this rank,
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.240]   they would pay them accordingly.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.620]   And that's why a centurion was a very wealthy man.
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:11.620]   A typical Roman soldier's pay would be about 225 denarii.
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:17.300]   A typical centurion's salary was 3,750 to 7,500.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:23.180]   So anything between 150 times to 2,000 times
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.180]   a regular soldier's pay.
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.120]   So this was not just a higher-ranking individual.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:33.620]   This is a very wealthy man because he came up the ranks.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:37.860]   And as I mentioned, he had 100 soldiers under his care
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.740]   and he is very wealthy, so he was a powerful man.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.340]   He was a wealthy man.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.740]   And that's why he is described as an individual
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.180]   who loved Israel and he built their synagogue.
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.980]   Just out of his generosity, out of his own pocket,
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.100]   he just built the synagogue
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.260]   and that's why he became prominent.
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.620]   Now, the reason why this is so important
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:03.300]   is because when, if you were a Jew in the first century
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.840]   and if you were to think who is the enemy of Israel,
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.260]   before they think of the big government,
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.920]   before they think of Caesar or Rome,
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.540]   the first person that they would think of
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:18.700]   is the centurion because he was given the task
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.380]   to keep the peace.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.420]   He was the one, if anybody rebelled,
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:23.780]   he would take his 100 soldiers
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.220]   and squash any kind of rebellion.
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.540]   He was the one, if the tax collectors
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.580]   were having a hard time collecting taxes,
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.900]   he would send his soldiers.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:36.020]   So this is the guy who was given charge to kill people,
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.540]   put them in prison, to beat them,
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.280]   to suppress any kind of rebellion.
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.300]   So in any other circumstance,
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.360]   a centurion would have been an enemy of Israel.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.740]   And now, all of this is not by chance.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.180]   And we're gonna see this later,
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.800]   why this is so significant.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.000]   So we know, one, he was an accomplished man.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.200]   He's a wealthy man.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:01.720]   Two, he's described as a very loving man.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:05.660]   Despite who he is to Israel,
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.620]   he's described to us as a loving man.
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.740]   You remember in Matthew 5.41, Jesus says,
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.980]   "Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two."
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:17.540]   Now, Jesus was not just pulling this out of nowhere.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.900]   There was actually a law that the Romans put
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.900]   against all their subjects,
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.740]   that if a soldier is walking into town
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.260]   and his equipment is too heavy,
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.780]   it was required by law that if a soldier tells you
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.340]   to take my equipment and go with me a mile,
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:39.340]   by law, they had to do that, by law.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.380]   So Jesus was saying, so when they think
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.220]   about loving your enemy, the first thing
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.140]   that they would have thought of is,
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.500]   anytime a soldier comes into town,
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.500]   anytime they see a soldier around the village,
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.580]   they can tell them to stop whatever it is they're doing.
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.500]   Imagine a young mother walking with a child
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.500]   and said, "I need your help,"
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.020]   and she has to drop whatever she's doing.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.900]   Imagine a field worker in the middle of the heat
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.500]   and a soldier comes in, "I need your help."
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.420]   By law, he had to stop what he's doing
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.180]   and carry that equipment one mile.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.580]   And at the end of that mile,
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.220]   he would just pick another person
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.900]   and he said, "Now you help me."
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.300]   By law, they had to do that.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.340]   So can you imagine the animosity
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:20.340]   that the Jews had toward these soldiers in particular?
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:25.140]   And the centurion is a captain of these soldiers.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.900]   Despite that, we are told that the elders
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.420]   of the Jews came pleading on his behalf.
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:37.580]   Now, if the centurion did, like, force them to,
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.860]   by sword, "My servant is sick,
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.780]   "so you better go get Jesus to come heal,"
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.860]   that's not how it's described.
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.700]   In Luke chapter 7, 4 to 5, it says,
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.820]   "When they came to Jesus, they earnestly implored,
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:53.700]   "saying, 'The elders of Israel, of the synagogue,
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.020]   "'earnestly implored him.'"
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:59.620]   So they weren't forced to, right?
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.180]   It wasn't because he had a knife to the throat
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.740]   that you better go get him.
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.900]   He said, "They came to Jesus on his behalf.
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.740]   "He's worthy for you to grant this to him,
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.100]   "for he loves our nation,
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.380]   "and it was he who built us our synagogue."
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:19.260]   A centurion, the soldiers that were stationed locally,
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.500]   these are not just some figures way out in Rome,
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.180]   these are not the Pontius Pilate, this is not Caesar.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:30.060]   The actual soldiers that enforced Roman law
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.060]   would have been under the centurion's care,
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.300]   the hundred soldiers that were walking around the villages
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.420]   making sure, and they were either either mercenaries,
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:40.660]   taxed soldiers, or policemen.
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:44.020]   So in other words, they were the ones.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.460]   They were the ones that were enforcing
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.300]   all the laws that they hated.
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.700]   And yet, this centurion is represented
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.460]   by the leaders of Israel begging on his behalf,
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.420]   "Lord, he is worthy."
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.020]   And he's described as somebody who loves Israel,
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.620]   and he paid out of his own pocket to build the synagogue.
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:04.900]   Naturally, he would have been an enemy.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.180]   So just that fact alone,
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.180]   a Jew who's reading this in the first century,
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.060]   it's like, a centurion did this?
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:15.380]   That enemy, that enemy that represents our enemy,
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.660]   he did this?
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:20.700]   It tells us that even though,
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.980]   naturally, he would have been an enemy,
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.460]   he's described as a friend of Israel.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.800]   He builds a synagogue for them.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.500]   And then, he's concerned for his own slave.
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:34.060]   I mean, again, it's not because of money, right?
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.380]   'Cause he was a filthy rich man.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:36.380]   If one of his slaves died,
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.780]   I mean, that was considered his property.
[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.180]   If they didn't behave, he could have whooped him
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:43.020]   and then literally killed him and just got another slave.
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.980]   'Cause I mean, this is a filthy rich man.
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.380]   And yet, he shows compassion to his slave.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:53.660]   You see, he's described to us as an accomplished man.
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.420]   He's described to us as a loving man,
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.260]   even though he's in a position of authority
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.700]   and power over Israel and the Jews.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.620]   He's in the position of power over his slave.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.240]   He's compassionate, he's gracious, he's loving.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.740]   You know, oftentimes, if you wanna see the character
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.780]   of a man, see how he treats somebody who is beneath him.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:18.860]   You know, people learn how to kiss up to their peers
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.180]   or kiss up to people who have something
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.980]   that you'll benefit from if you do that.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.420]   But watch how he treats people that are beneath him
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.860]   or he considers beneath them.
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.020]   Who are less than him, knows less than him,
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.740]   in lesser position than him.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:35.420]   At a restaurant, servants, people that you may not have
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.620]   any specific benefit by being good to them.
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:40.060]   See how that man treats that person
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:41.500]   and you'll see his character.
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.540]   Well, this man had nothing to benefit
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.020]   from being nice to the Jews.
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:50.260]   He had nothing to benefit from pleading
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:52.420]   on the behalf of his servant, and yet,
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:56.060]   he's presented to us, despite his position,
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.860]   despite his authority, despite his power,
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.460]   he was a very gentle, loving, and gracious man.
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.060]   He was also a very humble man.
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.660]   In Luke 7, six through seven, it says,
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:09.100]   now Jesus started on his way with them
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.700]   and when he was not far from the house,
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.420]   the centurions sent friends saying to him,
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.300]   Lord, again, let's stop right there.
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:22.980]   Centurion is the highest ranking position in that area.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.980]   He would have been the governor.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.900]   Everybody would be beneath him.
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:32.580]   Only a Roman aristocrat would be above him.
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.980]   And yet, he sees this lowly rabbi
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.940]   walk around with his disciples
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.660]   and even the way he addresses him, Lord,
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:45.300]   not hey, Jew, hey, you,
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.660]   and that would have been a natural thing for him to do,
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.420]   but he humbles himself, said,
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.340]   Lord, do not trouble yourself further,
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.060]   for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:01.180]   You notice how the Jews, when they presented him to Jesus,
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.300]   they said, he is worthy of your attention.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:09.540]   And the reasoning they give is that he was good to us.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.260]   He was good to Israel and he built a synagogue.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:16.260]   You notice how typically we tend to measure
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.300]   other people's righteousness by our righteousness?
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.140]   Whatever it is that we are good at,
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.940]   that's the measuring stick.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.300]   And I confess, when I was heavily involved
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.140]   with the homeless ministry,
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:29.660]   that was the measuring stick that I used
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.420]   to measure everybody.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.860]   They're gonna help or not.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.820]   Do you care or not?
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:36.420]   So if you happen to be a person
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:40.820]   who is deep into theology, that's your measuring stick.
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:42.740]   You study a lot, so who studies?
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.140]   Who studies more than me?
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.300]   If you happen to be somebody who is compassionate,
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:47.820]   that's your measuring stick.
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.980]   Are they compassionate?
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.300]   If you happen to be somebody who's disciplined,
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.340]   well, who's more disciplined?
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.220]   If you happen to be somebody who's generous,
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.460]   that's your measuring stick.
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:58.580]   If you serve more, who's serving more than me?
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.300]   Our natural tendency is to use our righteousness
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.380]   to measure other people's righteousness.
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.180]   And so the Jews said, he is worthy,
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:08.400]   he's a righteous man because he loves what we love.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.620]   He loves Israel.
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.740]   He built it, so therefore he is worthy.
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:18.020]   But when he encounters Jesus,
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.820]   he recognizes how unworthy he is.
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.220]   The exact opposite of what they say.
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.380]   He said, for this reason, I did not even consider myself
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.300]   worthy to come to you.
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.140]   I did not come to you.
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.780]   And that's probably why the elders of Israel
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:31.980]   went on his behalf because he wouldn't go.
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.220]   I'm a centurion, I'm a soldier.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.620]   Jews naturally hate me.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:40.860]   I don't know, am I in a position to ask
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.660]   the rabbi of Israel to come to my house?
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:47.580]   Again, from a human point of view,
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.660]   he would have every right.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:51.060]   He could have asserted his authority.
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.260]   He could have asserted his sword, his power.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.900]   He could have sent 100 soldiers with him
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:56.700]   to get him to forcefully come.
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:00.540]   Instead, he recognizes Christ.
[00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:03.620]   The Bible doesn't describe who he is.
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.860]   It doesn't describe the details of who he is.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:11.780]   But the Bible does describe other Jews who are God-fearers,
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.940]   who didn't necessarily convert to Judaism,
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.060]   but they were worshipers of Yahweh.
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:20.620]   So they were Gentiles who admired the faith of the Jews,
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:24.380]   the system of the God of the Jews,
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.780]   and yet they never truly converted.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.820]   So this is probably one of those men,
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.980]   who are God-fearers, who had faith in God,
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:35.460]   but didn't convert to Judaism.
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:41.980]   In fact, this man did not love Israel because of the Jews.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.100]   In fact, remember what Paul says in Romans 2:24?
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.860]   He's indicting the Israelites.
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.260]   He said, "The name of God is blasphemed among you Gentiles
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.620]   "because of you."
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:57.820]   The Jews did such a poor job representing God
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:01.180]   to the nations, even though their whole calling
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:04.620]   was to magnify who God is, to represent who he is,
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.500]   but they did such a poor job
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.860]   that the Gentiles actually ended up hating God
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:09.700]   because of them.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:13.860]   So this man did not become a God-fearer because of them.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.540]   It's despite the fact.
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:19.940]   And remember, the Jews hated the Romans.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.340]   Remember we talked about a while back,
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.780]   the zealots actually used to carry a knife around?
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:27.660]   And so their whole thing was, if we see our enemy,
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.980]   we're willing to die, we're willing to kill them.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:34.740]   So the top of that list would have been tax collectors,
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:38.620]   and then those who supported the tax collectors,
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:40.220]   which would have been a centurion.
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:43.060]   So on the Jewish side, it would have been a tax collector,
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.180]   and on the Roman side, the top of that list
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:46.580]   would have been a centurion.
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:52.700]   So imagine, despite that, despite all of that,
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.580]   he became a God-fearer,
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.540]   and he won the respect of these people.
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:03.740]   The centurion by position could have assorted authority,
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.060]   could have had whatever he wanted,
[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:07.820]   he could have bought anything he wanted with his money,
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:11.020]   and yet he came to Jesus and he humbled himself.
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.980]   So he was an accomplished man.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:14.820]   He was a gracious, loving man.
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.460]   And he was even a humble man.
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:19.780]   But if we stop right here,
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.300]   you would miss the whole point of what's going on.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:25.460]   You would miss the whole point of what's going on.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:28.740]   Because Jesus was not amazed by his accomplishment.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.980]   If he was, he would have been amazed by Nicodemus.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.660]   He would have been amazed by these rich people.
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:37.740]   That's not what amazed him.
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:42.420]   He wasn't amazed because of his position or his power.
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.620]   He wasn't amazed simply because he was a gracious man.
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:48.100]   There's plenty of gracious people who are not Christians,
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.260]   who are not believers.
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:52.500]   There's a lot of humble people.
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.700]   That's not what amazed him.
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.380]   What amazed him was his faith.
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.660]   His faith.
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.020]   In Luke 7, 7-9, it says,
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:08.380]   "But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:12.260]   "For I also am a man placed under authority,
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.100]   "with soldiers under me.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:17.020]   "And I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes.
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.420]   "And to another, 'Come,' and he comes.
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:23.340]   "And to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it.
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:27.140]   "Now when Jesus heard this, he marveled at him."
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.380]   In other words, Jesus was amazed.
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.780]   Imagine if it's hard for us,
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.900]   those of you who are in Jubilee.
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:39.140]   It's hard for us to be amazed and marveled.
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.460]   I mean, yeah, I've seen it.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:42.660]   It's like, oh, this boba is fantastic.
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:44.820]   You know, is it really better than the other 100 bobas
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:45.780]   that we've tasted?
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:49.860]   Jesus marveled,
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:55.580]   was amazed at what this man was saying,
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.380]   and turned and said to the crowd that was following him,
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:01.460]   "I say to you, not even in Israel
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:04.060]   "have I found such great faith."
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.980]   In fact, if you look into the scripture,
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.860]   there's two other instances where a centurion shows up.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.940]   The first instance outside of this
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.940]   is when Jesus is hanging on the cross.
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:18.780]   And as Jesus is suffering, being crucified,
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:21.860]   it was a centurion soldier who looked up at him
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:26.100]   and recognizes this was an innocent man that we crucified.
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:31.740]   And as the centurion, the enemy of Israel,
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:35.300]   out of his mouth comes, "This was injustice."
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:38.780]   And then we go to Acts chapter 10.
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.260]   When the Holy Spirit falls upon the church
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:44.460]   and Peter falls into a deep sleep and says,
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:47.620]   "The gospel has come to the Gentiles.
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:52.180]   "Do not claim what is unclean, or clean, unclean.
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:54.100]   "If I tell you it's clean, it's clean."
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.820]   And God sends him to where?
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.140]   To the centurion's house.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:02.740]   So the first converts that come to Christ is a centurion.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:07.900]   The enemy of Israel, the one who was oppressing.
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:10.060]   Now this was not by accident.
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.980]   Remember prior to in the address,
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:14.980]   Jesus was teaching them, "Love your enemies.
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:18.620]   "Bless those who curse you to turn the other cheek."
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.460]   And after the discourse happens,
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:24.340]   the first person that he encounters is the enemy of Israel.
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:30.420]   And this enemy is the one that he commends.
[00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:33.460]   This enemy of Israel that he just told the nation of Israel.
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:36.060]   He said, "The reason why what I'm telling you
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:38.100]   "is difficult for you to swallow
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:42.740]   "is because your leaders are blind, and you are blind,
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.620]   "and they're leading you into a ditch."
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:49.420]   And then he goes to the enemy, the centurion,
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:52.300]   the people that they thought were enemies of Israel,
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:56.060]   and he was the one practicing grace and love.
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.780]   This is not by accident.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:02.300]   This was a commendation for the centurion,
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.660]   but this was a slap in the face to Israel.
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.940]   Despite him being a Gentile,
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:10.940]   despite the fact that Israel hated him,
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:14.300]   despite the fact that Israel did such a poor job
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:18.660]   representing who God is, he became a God-fearer.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.100]   And when Jesus showed up, he recognized who he is.
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:25.300]   He said, "Lord, I'm unworthy of you coming even to my house."
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:30.380]   Yet the Israelites, who had centuries after centuries
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:32.060]   of the prophets coming, telling them,
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.860]   they have the word of God, the spirit of God.
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.260]   They've seen miracles, they have generations,
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:41.540]   they have festivals implanted in their community,
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:44.220]   generation after generation after generation,
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:49.220]   and yet when the Messiah came, they didn't recognize him.
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:54.300]   This was an indictment against the nation of Israel,
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.540]   as much as it is an amazement for this man's faith.
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:04.180]   You and I are in the same danger.
[00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:06.260]   As the Israelites.
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:10.740]   Because there's no other generation
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:15.380]   that has been more privileged with the truth than me and you.
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:22.060]   We have access to the greatest speakers in our generation.
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:26.740]   In fact, my favorite preacher is Martin Lloyd-Jones,
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.300]   and it's been decades since he passed away,
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.660]   but they have recordings of him.
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:35.300]   We have people who've lived 200, 300 years ago,
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.860]   and we have the writing that we can read.
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:39.660]   We can just push a button and it shows up at my house.
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:43.540]   If I don't like reading, I can get an audible.
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:47.420]   If I don't like opening books, it'll come digitally.
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.940]   I can wake up three in the morning,
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:53.620]   and I'm like, "Oh, I wonder what he says about this,"
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:56.540]   and I can just go online and type it, and it just pops up.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:00.380]   We have more access to more teaching
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.940]   than we have to education.
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:06.460]   It is easier to come to church,
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:08.500]   nice air-conditioned building,
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:11.180]   with nice parking, with food,
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:12.780]   everything that we need provided,
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.940]   and yet, and yet,
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:21.780]   constant grumbling of how we don't have enough.
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:27.820]   I remember years ago when we were coming out of China,
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.180]   was coming into Beijing,
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:32.060]   we were all praying because we wanna go there,
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.940]   we wanna plant a church, we're gonna send missionaries,
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:35.700]   so we had this great plan to do this,
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.460]   but because of the Communist Party,
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:41.260]   we always had to kind of do it in the background,
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:42.460]   and we couldn't freely function,
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:43.380]   so we were all praying,
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:45.900]   "Lord, use this Olympic to open the doors
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:48.780]   "so that we can come, and people would have more freedom,"
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:53.140]   and then we met some of the underground church leaders,
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.500]   and they were reluctant to share,
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.620]   but they told us that they're praying
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:58.180]   that the doors would not open.
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:02.180]   That was kind of, I knew exactly what they were saying
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:03.180]   when they said that.
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:05.500]   They said, "We don't want the doors open
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:07.780]   "'cause we don't want Western influence,
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:09.900]   "Western Christian influence coming in."
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:15.220]   They wanted finance because we have finances,
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:18.300]   we have books, we have know-hows,
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:20.340]   so they wanted that support,
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:21.900]   but they didn't want our faith.
[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:27.460]   They said the underground church was much more vibrant,
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:31.460]   much more powerful before the Westerners started coming in.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:32.620]   Now, it's a slap in the face.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:34.900]   We're spending all this money going out to China,
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:36.740]   and they're praying that the doors would open.
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:39.300]   Well, guess whose prayer God listened to?
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.780]   Their prayers were much more effective.
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:47.300]   You and I have been exposed to so much.
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:49.420]   Let's be honest.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.860]   We've gotten so spoiled.
[00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:53.620]   We've gotten so spoiled
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:57.900]   that if the situation just simply isn't perfect,
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.860]   it's like, "Well, I can't 'cause of this.
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:02.020]   "I don't have any older people here.
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.100]   "I don't have any younger people.
[00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:04.540]   "I don't know, it's too far."
[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:08.060]   Our service is going, "What time is it?
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:09.420]   "How can I come to a church?"
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:14.660]   Yet, you and I have everything that we need.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:17.580]   You know when the church had everything that they needed
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:18.900]   for a life of godliness?
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:20.940]   In the first century.
[00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:22.100]   In the first century.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:25.300]   In the first century.
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:28.540]   As soon as Jesus was crucified and was resurrected,
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:30.380]   as soon as the Holy Spirit came,
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.580]   they had everything that they needed
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:33.780]   for a life of godliness
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.900]   and the knowledge of his son, Jesus Christ,
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:38.420]   and yet, 2,000 years later, with all the books,
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:41.860]   all the translations, all the preaching,
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:43.660]   all the teaching, all the organization,
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:47.620]   all the money that you and I can possibly imagine,
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.420]   and yet, we are the weakest.
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:55.740]   See, the Jews had all the privilege.
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:56.820]   Centuries.
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:00.420]   They are more privileged than anyone in history,
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:04.020]   and yet, they did not recognize Christ.
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:07.540]   That's why Jesus was amazed.
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:08.900]   In Hebrews chapter 11, six, it says,
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:11.380]   "And without faith, it is impossible to please him."
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:12.540]   Let that sink in.
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:16.420]   Without faith, it is impossible to please him.
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:18.940]   You can work harder, but God is not pleased.
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:21.420]   You can give more, but God is not pleased.
[00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:23.380]   You can worship louder.
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:25.340]   You can be better organized.
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:28.020]   You can have a fantastic discipleship program,
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:29.540]   but it says, "If without faith,
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.100]   it is impossible to please him.
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:37.060]   For he who comes to God must believe that he is,
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:39.780]   and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him."
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:42.780]   We have a natural tendency,
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:46.860]   because we have so many resources,
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:48.900]   that we think that if we just get more resources,
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.580]   if we just apply ourselves more,
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:53.060]   if we just get organized a certain way,
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:56.340]   but he says, "Without faith,
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:57.940]   it is impossible to please him."
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.260]   Faith is not something that you can muster up.
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:02.900]   You're not gonna wake up one day and say,
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:04.860]   "I'm just gonna have more faith today."
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:08.540]   You can't just get faith.
[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:19.220]   Faith is something that requires us to come and receive
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:20.860]   by the grace of God.
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:24.340]   So if something has gone wrong,
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:27.060]   our first reaction should not be,
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:28.980]   "Let's get better organized.
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:31.380]   Let's have more accountability.
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:32.980]   Let's have more programs."
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:37.740]   The first and the most important thing
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:41.820]   that God calls us to do is to come before him
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:46.780]   and ask him and beg him and urge him,
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:48.700]   "Increase my faith."
[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:52.780]   It's because you and I have so much resources
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:54.780]   that we think that if we pour more resources,
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:56.940]   more right people, more training,
[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:58.820]   that we can get this done.
[00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:04.140]   It is not something that you and I can do by our own power.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.580]   Is that something new to us?
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:10.940]   No, it's because we have the resources, so much resources.
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:16.460]   More than 99.9999% of any Christian who has ever lived,
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:19.380]   you and I have access to more than that
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.860]   than any Christian who has ever lived.
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:27.540]   And yet we are the most prayerless.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:33.420]   We're the most prayerless.
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:38.140]   Because we think that if we apply ourselves more,
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.740]   if we just do more,
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.060]   if we just give more,
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.700]   if we just read more,
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:48.460]   if we just organize more,
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:54.460]   Jesus wasn't amazed by his accomplishment.
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:58.380]   He wasn't amazed because he had good character.
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:02.260]   He was amazed because of his great faith.
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:06.540]   It was his faith that made him great.
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.940]   It was his faith that made him loving.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:12.740]   It was his faith that made him humble.
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:17.060]   An accomplished man without faith
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.940]   is an arrogant man.
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:26.340]   A powerful man without faith becomes a tyrant.
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:32.420]   Someone who has the great standing, who is very wealthy,
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:37.940]   becomes a very proud and oppressive person without faith.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.540]   Without faith.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.620]   In fact, you can see it the other way.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:46.740]   The opposite is also true.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:51.300]   A man who hasn't accomplished much without faith
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.420]   is a depressed man.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:59.060]   A man who had goals and didn't quite reach it
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:02.100]   and doesn't have the kind of money that other people do
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:03.300]   is an anxious man.
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.740]   (silence)
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:11.500]   Somebody who measures with other people
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.820]   and they don't quite measure up,
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:16.700]   and they are a depressed man without faith.
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:20.300]   What amazed Jesus was not his accomplishment.
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.220]   It was his faith.
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:25.340]   I'm gonna read you,
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.700]   this is a quote of a quote of J.C. Riles on faith,
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:31.660]   but it's, I want, 'cause I think he articulates it so well.
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:34.500]   I wanna read the whole thing to you.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.700]   In walking with God,
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:41.100]   a man will go just as far as he believes and no further.
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:45.460]   His life will always be proportioned to his faith.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.740]   His peace, his patience, his course, his zeal,
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.460]   his works, all will be according to his faith.
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.700]   Riles then catalogs a number of great Christians
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.660]   such as John Wesley and George Whitefield
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:57.900]   and Robert Murray McChain,
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.420]   pointing out that it was faith that made them great.
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.220]   Some might say that it was prayer that strengthened them,
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:04.900]   to which Riles replies,
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.340]   why did they pray so much?
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:09.020]   Simply because they had much faith.
[01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:11.940]   What is prayer but faith speaking to God?
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:15.340]   Others might account their success to diligence
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:16.700]   and labor to which he responds.
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.820]   What is Christian diligence but faith at work?
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:21.340]   Perhaps it was his boldness,
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.580]   but what is Christian boldness
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:25.540]   but faith honestly doing its duty?
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.660]   If then we desire to be pleasing to God
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:29.220]   and useful to those around us,
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.460]   Riles commends to us faith.
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:34.620]   Faith is the root of real Christian character.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:38.940]   Let your root be right and your fruit will soon abound.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.780]   Let me say that again.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:43.340]   Let your root be right and your fruit will soon abound.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:45.300]   Your spiritual prosperity will always be
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:47.260]   according to your faith.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.540]   He that believeth shall not only be saved,
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:52.060]   but shall never thirst, shall overcome,
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.940]   shall be established, shall walk firmly
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:57.900]   on waters of this world, and shall do great works.
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:02.820]   Everything that we do must be because of our faith.
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:08.580]   Without faith, hard work naturally becomes pride.
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:14.220]   Without faith, your success becomes arrogance.
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:18.580]   Without faith, all your achievements, all your fruits
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:20.900]   becomes a source of judgment to other people.
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.980]   That's why he was amazed.
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.660]   Why didn't Israel, after everything,
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.580]   after all the benefits that they had,
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.980]   and yet this centurion who had nothing,
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.700]   despite the poor witness,
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:38.340]   despite centuries of not having a witness,
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:43.580]   how did he recognize?
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.460]   In Luke chapter 17 through to five,
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:47.900]   I want you to pay very close attention to this
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:50.740]   because he reiterates what Jesus just said.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:54.620]   Be on your guard if your brother sins, rebuke him,
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.900]   and if he repents, forgive him,
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.700]   and if he sins against you seven times a day,
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:01.980]   returns to you seven times saying, I repent, forgive him.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:05.340]   Now, that's what Jesus was saying, right,
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.420]   before in his discourse.
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:10.020]   Turn the other cheek, bless those who curse you,
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:12.420]   love your enemies.
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:17.300]   Jesus says that to his disciples, and look at the response.
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.780]   The apostle said to the Lord, increase our faith.
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:24.420]   They didn't ask the question, Lord, how do we do that?
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.260]   What do we do?
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:26.540]   Right?
[01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.820]   Well, get together with other people
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.660]   and have accountability.
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.740]   Ask them five questions.
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.380]   Did you do this?
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:35.460]   Who are the people that you have a hard time loving?
[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:37.780]   Make a list of them, and then make sure,
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.300]   like give five action items to go down the list,
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.860]   and then go and make sure you take care of this.
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:44.740]   Read some books together.
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.700]   Lord, how do I turn the other cheek?
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.660]   How do I love my enemy?
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:51.940]   I can not hit them back.
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.660]   I can try not to speak evil of them,
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.180]   but how do I love them?
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:06:00.260]   How do I love them when everything in my heart hates them?
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:03.340]   How do I just turn that off?
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:06.900]   So the apostles, when they heard this from Jesus,
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.380]   they knew what Jesus was asking them was impossible.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:13.260]   That's why they returned and asked him,
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:15.020]   Lord, increase our faith.
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:20.660]   Until we open our eyes to see
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:23.140]   that Jesus is much more beautiful
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.820]   than anything else,
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:29.100]   how can you possibly love your enemy?
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:34.380]   How can you possibly desire the best for them?
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:39.060]   What discipline, what organization, what teaching,
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.180]   what book are you gonna read
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:44.020]   to love somebody who is there to hurt you?
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:49.060]   The only way that a natural man could possibly do this
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.780]   is he opens his eyes and he sees
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.780]   that the reward coming with Christ
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.940]   is greater than any damage that this man could do,
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:59.940]   that I begin to see the sinner through the lens of Christ,
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:04.860]   that I begin to see him with compassion
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:07.660]   as Jesus saw compassion with me.
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:12.380]   And only a man who has faith and seeing things
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.780]   through the eyes of his faith,
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:16.580]   of the treasure of Christ,
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:20.180]   can even contemplate, even entertain the thought
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:22.420]   of loving somebody that is difficult to love.
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:25.700]   That's why the apostles, in response to that,
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.380]   says, increase my faith.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:28.940]   He didn't say, how do I do it?
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:30.260]   What people do I need to,
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:33.020]   what discipler do I need to get?
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.140]   Lord, increase my faith.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:39.220]   In other words, this is impossible for me.
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:42.100]   Second Thessalonians 1.3, it says,
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.220]   we ought always to give thanks to God
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:48.420]   for you, brethren, as is only fitting
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:51.820]   because your faith is greatly enlarged
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:54.180]   and the love for each one of you toward one another
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.620]   grows ever greater.
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.300]   You noticed here, he says,
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.580]   that their love is growing because of what?
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:02.540]   Because their faith is increasing.
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:05.860]   Because their faith is increasing.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:11.820]   Christianity isn't about being better organized.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:17.300]   A man who has great faith,
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:19.620]   but little knowledge,
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.660]   is much more powerful
[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:27.820]   than a man who has studied and experienced
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:31.100]   all his life and yet has little faith.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:37.180]   We don't gain right standing with God
[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:38.620]   because of our hard work.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:42.260]   Our prayers are not powerful
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.180]   because we know better theology.
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:47.140]   We're not more effective.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.300]   We don't bear more fruit
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.060]   because we try harder than other people,
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.100]   because we sacrifice more than other people.
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:54.020]   It is by faith.
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.820]   By faith.
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:59.100]   It's because we believe.
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:02.540]   We obey because we believe.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:05.100]   We worship because we believe.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:08.100]   We give because we believe.
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.220]   We share because we believe.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.860]   We sacrifice, we worship,
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:16.060]   and we love because we believe.
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:22.060]   So the greatest thing that any Christian can do,
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:24.740]   the greatest thing, the most important,
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:25.940]   not the only thing,
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:28.660]   but the greatest thing that a Christian can do
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:31.940]   is to beseech the Lord of the harvest,
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:34.180]   is to pray.
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:36.340]   To pray.
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.060]   Before you organize,
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:41.420]   before you read,
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:44.700]   before you implement,
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.620]   before you proclaim,
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:51.220]   is to come before the Lord and to pray.
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:54.340]   I believe.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:55.860]   Lord, help my unbelief.
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:58.220]   Open my eyes.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:00.700]   Open my eyes.
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.460]   The things that I sing about,
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:04.020]   the things that I know,
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.820]   that it will become more real to me.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:08.380]   Yeah, we believe it.
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.300]   We confess it.
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:12.580]   But as soon as the service is over,
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:14.980]   as soon as we get back into our life,
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.300]   it doesn't seem real.
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:19.860]   It just seems like wishful thought.
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:21.860]   And because of that,
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:24.340]   we're constantly struggling to not to love
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.940]   the things of this world
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:28.020]   because it's never become rubbish.
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:32.100]   It just become things that we shouldn't do.
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.620]   But only when you are able to see Christ
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:36.020]   in the eyes of faith,
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:38.620]   in light of the surpassing knowledge
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:39.660]   of knowing Jesus Christ,
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:40.980]   it becomes rubbish
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:43.340]   because of our faith.
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:47.260]   Because we're able to see heaven in our faith.
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:50.620]   We're able to see his glory in faith.
[01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:54.020]   We're able to see his deep love
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:56.020]   when we have faith.
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:00.500]   What amazed Jesus was not his character,
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.380]   was not his sacrifice,
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:04.660]   was not his accomplishments,
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:05.500]   but his faith.
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:09.260]   Shouldn't that be our greatest pursuit?
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:13.060]   Shouldn't that be our greatest desire?
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:17.780]   Shouldn't that be our greatest prayer request?
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:21.020]   Lord, I believe,
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.300]   help my unbelief,
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.020]   increase my faith.
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:25.820]   Let's pray.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:33.980]   Father,
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:38.300]   increase our faith.
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:43.780]   Lord, we struggle with our flesh.
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:46.420]   We struggle to sacrifice.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:49.100]   We struggle to be sober.
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:54.460]   We struggle with the entanglements of this world,
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:56.140]   with foolish pleasures, Lord God,
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:58.820]   that we know will pass and will mean nothing,
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:01.260]   and yet we are so tempted week to week.
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:05.260]   Open our eyes to see the glory
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:07.100]   that you have already given us.
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:09.780]   Increase our faith, Lord.
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:11.900]   Help us, Lord God.
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:15.940]   Help us, Lord God,
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:19.620]   that we would become men and women of great faith,
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:22.900]   that because we believe you,
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.740]   that we would love you,
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:27.700]   we would worship you,
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.060]   and that we would obey you.
[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:33.460]   Lord, increase our faith.
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:37.020]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:39.020]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:42.620]   (congregation applauding)
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:48.220]   (gentle music)
