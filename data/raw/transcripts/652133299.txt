[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Hi everyone, my name is Tiffany Yu.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.720]   I've been attending Berean for eight years and I'm going to be sharing my testimony.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.440]   I grew up in a Christian household and was blessed to have heard the gospel.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.760]   I'm so thankful that my father shared the gospel with me on many occasions before I
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.080]   was even in second grade.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.640]   My parents and my Sunday school teacher shared a gospel tract with me at an early age and
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.640]   I said that I accepted it.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.020]   I wrote that date down in my Bible and I assumed I was a Christian.
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.280]   At that time, I had no reason to question or to test my faith.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.200]   I grew up attending VBS every year and participated in baptism in high school without really questioning
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.740]   myself.
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.840]   In the past five years, I've wrestled with serious doubts of whether I was a genuine
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.040]   believer at the time I had gotten baptized.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.600]   In reflecting, prayer, wrestling with God's word, carefully examining biblical benchmarks
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.400]   and encouragement from my church body, I've come to the conclusion that at the time of
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.160]   my baptism back in high school, I'd intellectually acknowledged the gospel and got baptized because
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.600]   it was what was considered noble in the community.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.880]   The following are biblical benchmarks I have carefully examined to conclude I was not a
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.720]   genuine believer at the time I was baptized.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.600]   Number one, I don't recall having a personal relationship with God.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.160]   The gospel means being reconciled to a proper relationship with a holy God.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.600]   My definition of being Christian was attending church, obeying my parents, and being a good
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.600]   person.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.440]   Second, I didn't understand my sin.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.440]   I believe sin only encompassed overt acts like stealing, murdering, cheating.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.800]   I knew I was not perfect, but I also believed I was a good child.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.160]   I was well-mannered, a rule follower, and obeyed my parents.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.040]   I tried my best to please my parents.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.440]   Third, I did not understand the authority and power of God.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.800]   God's word was not inerrant over my life.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.320]   Although I was exposed to the Bible at an early age, it was all head knowledge, and
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.800]   I never understood why I was memorizing these verses or did I see a need to apply these
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.080]   truths in my life.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.080]   Fourth, I did not experience freedom from sin and joy in Christ as it says in Romans
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.080]   8.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.840]   Romans 8, 1-2 says, "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.840]   Jesus.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.120]   The law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.120]   death."
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.800]   Fifth, I was not producing fruit.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.160]   I did not have the desire to increase in my love for Christ.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.000]   My desires were more self-serving.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.920]   On the outside, I was a Christian since I was so involved and I wanted to be seen by
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.840]   others as being a committed Christian.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.240]   But internally, my desires didn't concern Christ.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.680]   Reflecting back, I was not living for, by, and through God.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.360]   In high school, I felt a lot of pressure to do well and I had a lot of pride in my grades
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.920]   and extracurriculars.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.120]   I was surrounded by a group of ambitious and intelligent friends, and surrounded by them,
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.080]   I strove to be very academically focused just like them, and I wanted to work hard.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.640]   I easily entangled my identity in wanting to attend a good college, get a good job,
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.720]   and live a good life.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   In college, I checked out Berean on one Sunday in my freshman year, and I had a very hard
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.240]   time following along with Pastor Peter through his expository preaching.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.520]   I wasn't used to the style of preaching and I didn't understand why he was cross-referencing
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.840]   many Bible verses.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.680]   I later decided that Berean was probably not the right church for me.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.760]   But through the Lord's sovereignty, one of my friends was taking the BCC membership class
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.440]   the next summer, so I revisited Berean and checked it out with my friend Jessica.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.240]   That summer, I remember how I had been so convicted by Pastor Peter's preaching from
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.560]   God's word.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.200]   In reflecting, I saw how shallow my understanding of God was.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.320]   In my sophomore year, I began to understand God's attributes of his love, faithfulness,
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.360]   grace, and holiness through his word, and studying through the Book of Romans.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.280]   Reading the holiness of God that year in small groups transformed my understanding of God's
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.520]   standard of holiness.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.640]   Growing up in the church, I often heard about God's grace, but I had not personally experienced
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.440]   his true grace until I understood the depth of my sin.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.560]   God revealed that the internal sins of my heart offended him just as much as any overt
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.640]   sin as all of my sins, no matter big, small, they were all acts of treason and offensive
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.860]   to a just and holy God.
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.920]   I was so far from his perfect standard and there was nothing I could do to restore my
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.040]   relationship with God except through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.240]   God opened my eyes and heart to recognize how Christ, perfect and righteous, was the
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.480]   only mediator who could advocate and serve as a propitiation to atone for my sins.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.880]   In repentance, I experienced the freedom from sin and joy in Christ as I saw how God loved
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.980]   me so much to sacrifice his only son for my sake.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.600]   I can attest that God has truly been faithful and gracious through all seasons of my life,
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.020]   in seasons of joy and also in seasons of tribulation and trials.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.640]   He has softened my heart to recognize my identity in him, that all things I valued in the past
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.200]   have decreased in its value as I've experienced a newness of life in Christ.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.520]   Philippians 3, 8 says, "Indeed, I count everything as lost because of the surpassing worth of
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.000]   knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.800]   For his sake, I've suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.760]   that I may gain Christ.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.000]   Through his grace, I'm continually challenged daily to die and forsake the desires of my
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.480]   flesh and to strive to put on Christ and to follow him.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.320]   I'm still a sinner, but by believing, I can see his power and provision over my life now.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.720]   I have joy in Christ because my value and identity is rooted in him.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.160]   I desire to do his will, to abide in him and to strive to become more like Christ as I
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.760]   commit myself to follow after him."
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.880]   Galatians 2, 20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.160]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.160]   And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.280]   gave himself up for me."
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.800]   Second Corinthians 5, 17 says, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   The old has passed away.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.800]   Behold, the new has come."
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   Thank you.
