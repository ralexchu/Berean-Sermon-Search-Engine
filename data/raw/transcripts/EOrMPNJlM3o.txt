[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.980]   We will now begin our service.

[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.960]   Everything I've been through.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.960]   Use it for your glory.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.960]   >> Lord, I offer my days to you.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.960]   Lifting my praise to you
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   as a pleasing sacrifice.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:12.960]   Lord, I offer you my life.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   >> All that I am.
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.960]   All that I have.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.960]   I lay them down before you.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:28.960]   All longing I've been through.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.960]   Use it for your glory.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   >> Lord, I offer my days to you.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.960]   Lifting my praise to you.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:49.960]   As a pleasing sacrifice.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:57.960]   Lord, I offer you my life.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.960]   >> Things in the past.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.960]   >> Things in the past.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   Things yet unseen.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.960]   Wishes and dreams
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.960]   that are yet to come.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.940]   All of my hopes.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.940]   All of my plans.
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.940]   My heart and my hands
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:28.940]   are lifted to you.

[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:16.920]   Lord, I offer you my life.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.920]   >> All right, good morning.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.920]   Welcome to Breen Community Church Service.
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.920]   And to those of you who are also online as well,
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.920]   let me get to our announcements,
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.920]   if I can find it.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.920]   Okay.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.920]   All right, I'm just going to have to wing it.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.920]   All right.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.920]   Oh, I found it.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.920]   Okay.
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.920]   First of all, Mother's Day is coming up next Sunday.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.920]   Again, if you didn't know,
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.920]   next Sunday is Mother's Day.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.920]   So if you are a mother in the church
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.920]   or you are expecting
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.920]   or you want to make an announcement next Sunday,
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.920]   you can just show up to the Mother's Day lunch.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.920]   And it's going to be held at the new building
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.920]   in the cafe area.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.920]   And I know that some people may have asked
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.920]   about accommodating some people outside.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.920]   So we are considering that as well.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.920]   But the main part of it is going to be
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.920]   on that side of the building.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.920]   So please sign up for that.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.920]   If you haven't signed up,
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.920]   so that they can have plenty of food ready.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.920]   And then for the fathers,
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.920]   so that mothers don't have to worry
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.920]   about feeding us and feeling guilty,
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.920]   the fathers are going to have pizza.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.920]   It's $5 for the fathers
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.920]   and the children will be eating free.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.920]   So the fathers will have pizza
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.920]   on the outside parking lot.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.920]   Okay.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.920]   And so in that area.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.920]   So the fathers will be there watching the kids
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.920]   and then the mothers will enjoy
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.920]   their Mother's Day luncheon.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.900]   Okay.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.900]   So please sign up for that.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.900]   And if you are planning to bring your mom to this,
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:40.900]   please let us know ahead of time as well
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.900]   so that we can make sure
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.900]   that we have enough food to prepare.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:44.900]   So that's going on next Sunday.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.900]   And again, it's on the church app
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.900]   and the Facebook group.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.900]   So please sign up for that as soon as you can.
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.900]   If you can do it today,
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.900]   that would be helpful to the people
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.900]   who are getting that ready.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.900]   Our first annual Marine Golf Tournament fundraiser
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.900]   is happening on May 29th at 1.30 p.m.
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.900]   So if you are a golfer
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.900]   or you just want to donate money
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.900]   and make other people look good,
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.900]   you are welcome to join this.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.900]   It's a fundraiser for our missionaries.
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.900]   It's going to be going to the IMB,
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.900]   International Mission Fund for the Southern Baptist.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.900]   And so if you want to do that,
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.900]   it's going to be $80.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:19.900]   Mitchell Kim is the one
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.900]   who is going to be taking the sign-ups
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.900]   and he'll give you information
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:23.900]   of what's going on.
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.900]   And so Mitchell J. Kim.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.900]   So it's going to--again,
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.900]   this will be on the Facebook
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.900]   and also the church app.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.900]   So if you want to participate in that.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.900]   Again, you don't have to be good at golf,
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.900]   you just need to have money.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.900]   All right?
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.900]   So you can just sign up
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.900]   and they'll give you more information on that, okay?
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:44.900]   And also for Saturday of May 15th at 10.30,
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.900]   the family ministry led by Pastor Peter Chung
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.900]   is going to be having FAM245.
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.900]   This is a young couple who got married,
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.900]   I think he said 2018 or less.
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.900]   So if you happen to fall into that category,
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.900]   you're welcome to join that
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:18:59.900]   and he'll give you more information.
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.900]   And this is to kind of encourage
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.880]   the--you know, their newlyweds.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.880]   We'll call them newlyweds, okay?
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.880]   To kind of focus on their marriage
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.880]   and make sure that their disciplines
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.880]   and things that they're doing
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.880]   is going toward the right direction.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.880]   So again, that's happening on May 15th
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.880]   at 10.30 a.m., okay?
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.880]   All right, we'll give you a minute to respond
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.880]   and after we pray to give the offering.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.880]   Again, the physical offering box is in the back.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.880]   All right, let's pray.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.880]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your blessing
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.880]   and another week of your grace that sustains us
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.880]   and help us, Lord God, to give you worship
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.880]   that truly is in spirit and in truth.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.880]   And I pray that as we continue to study through your word
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.880]   that you would cause our hearts to be surrendered to you
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.880]   and that whatever it is that we so easily get entangled in,
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.880]   that you would help us,
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.880]   that no matter what we've brought into this room,
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.880]   that you would cause us to have a greater vision of Christ.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.880]   And we pray, Father, that as we give our offering,
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.880]   may it be multiplied for your use and your glory.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.880]   (soft piano music)

[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.820]   And then you may be seated.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:40.820]   Okay.
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.820]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12,
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.820]   we're gonna be in part two of part three
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.820]   in the first three verses.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.820]   Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1, 2, and 3.
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.820]   Okay.
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.820]   Reading out of the NASB,
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.820]   "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.820]   surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.820]   and the sin which so easily entangles us
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.820]   and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.820]   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith,
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.820]   who for the joy set before him endured the cross,
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.820]   despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of Jesus,
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.800]   the right hand of the throne of God.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   For consider him who has endured such hostility by sinners
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.800]   against himself so that you will not grow weary and lose heart."
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   Let's pray.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   Heavenly Father, we pray for guidance.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to teach us,
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   to open our eyes, to shape our thoughts,
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.800]   our emotions, our will,
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   that they may all be surrendered to your word.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.800]   We pray, Father God,
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.800]   that your Spirit would guide us, Lord God,
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.800]   that we may be sanctified,
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.780]   that we may go forth and that your word would not come back
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.780]   until it has accomplished the purpose you have ordained it.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.780]   And so we ask for your guidance in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.780]   All right, so this is part two of what we started last week
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.780]   about running this race.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.780]   And as we mentioned last week,
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.780]   the main imperative in this text is to run with endurance.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.780]   In English it says, "Let us fix our eyes,
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.780]   let us do this, let us do that."
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.780]   And those are all supporting ideas of the main idea
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.780]   is to let us run this race.
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.780]   So the question I want to start with you this morning is,
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.780]   what race are you running?
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.780]   And I'm not talking about what race did you sign up for.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.780]   What race are you actually running?
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.780]   You know, we call the race of this life,
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.780]   what do we call it, what does the world call it?
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.780]   What kind of race is it?
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.780]   Dog race?
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.780]   No, we call it rat race.
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.780]   And there's a reason why they call it a rat race, right?
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.780]   Because everybody is in some kind of a race, right?
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.780]   Competing, trying to get ahead, trying to be somebody.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.780]   That's why we go to school.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.780]   We work hard to get promotions and, you know,
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.780]   we invest money so that we can be at the next level.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.780]   And so every one of us is competing in some way.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.780]   And we are in some kind of a race,
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.780]   but are we in the race that the rest of the world is in
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:13.780]   or are we in the race that has been set before us, right?
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.780]   So the rat race is basically constantly living
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.780]   for the next goal.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:17.780]   So if you're a college student,
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.780]   your primary goal is to graduate and get a job.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.780]   If you got a job, your primary goal is to make sure
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.780]   that you get a better job.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.780]   And then if you're making enough money,
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.780]   your primary goal next one is to find somebody to settle down.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.780]   And if you're married, your primary goal is to have children
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.780]   and to raise them a certain way.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.780]   And then if you lived for a while,
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.780]   your primary goal is to have enough money in retirement
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.780]   to retire.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.780]   And then your primary goal is to make sure
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.780]   that you have a family to take care of
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.780]   and your grandchildren to take care of.
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.780]   And so that's the rat race.
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.780]   And it's not necessarily sinful.
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.780]   Nevertheless, it is a race that we're constantly concerned about
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.780]   and each stage of our life has some other thing
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.780]   that we need to shoot for.
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.780]   And we're constantly told that this is what
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.780]   an average 30-year-old has, an average 40-year-old has.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:05.780]   And by this age, you should have this
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.780]   because that's what everybody else has.
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.780]   And so if that's what is driving us,
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.780]   then we are in the rat race.
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.780]   But the race that he has set before us is a race,
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:17.780]   he says, that we ought to run with endurance.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.780]   And that's why we have 11 chapters of him telling us
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.780]   that this is the right race that you need to go to.
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:28.780]   And then so chapter 12 and 13 is reminding us
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:32.780]   that in considering, in considering knowing who Jesus is,
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.780]   if you confess that Jesus Christ is truly worthy
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.780]   of all our worship and attention,
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.780]   then we ought to be running this race.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.780]   So basically what he's saying in these three verses
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.780]   is to be calling us out of the rat race
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.780]   and to make sure that we're running the race
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.780]   that have eternal consequences.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.780]   You know, last week I finished a message
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:55.780]   about that man who ran the race in Mexico, Marathon,
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:58.780]   and I asked him, "Why did you suffer through
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.780]   with all the injuries that you had
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.780]   for over 13 miles in order to finish this race?"
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.780]   And again, he said, "My country did not send me
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.780]   5,000 miles to start the race.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.780]   They sent me 5,000 miles to finish it,
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.780]   even if it took much longer."
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.780]   So the call this morning to finish the race,
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.780]   you know, most of us have started the race at some point,
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.780]   whether it was when you're a child,
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.780]   maybe in your 20s or 30s or 40s,
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.780]   at some point you met Christ, your eyes were opened
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.780]   to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.780]   and you began this race, but the challenge now is
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.780]   that these listeners, these recipients of this letter,
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.780]   they weren't rejecting Christ.
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.780]   They were in danger of apostasy,
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.780]   not simply because they woke up one morning
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.780]   and realized, "I don't know if I want to follow Christ."
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.780]   That wasn't their problem.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.780]   Their problem wasn't one day they woke up
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.780]   and realized, "I don't know if I believe in these doctrines."
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.780]   That wasn't their problem.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:00.780]   The pressures of life, the concerns for this world,
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.780]   for the safety of their children,
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.780]   for the well-being of their future,
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:08.780]   caused them to get distracted and begin to ignore
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.780]   this great salvation that they have
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.780]   and they began to drift back into the rat race.
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.780]   This is not a danger of just a few Christians.
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.780]   This was not a danger just 2,000 years ago.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.780]   This is our primary danger today.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.780]   We talked about last week when he challenged us
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.780]   to run this race with endurance,
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.780]   that we ought to keep our eyes on the race that we're in.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.780]   Which race are we actually running?
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.780]   That we may run this race to finish this race
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.780]   and then to look back and see the cloud of witnesses
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.780]   that have gone before us who have finished the race as well,
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.780]   that we would see them as examples and inspiration
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.780]   for us to persevere in our race.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.780]   Today we want to look at verse 1 at the end of it
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.780]   when he says, "Let us lay aside every encumbrance and sin
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.780]   which so easily entangles us."
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:56.780]   Let us look within.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.780]   I did a quick search about the persecution
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.780]   and I've been mentioning, and if you've been following the news,
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:06.780]   the persecution against Christians has been rising rapidly
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.780]   in the last few years.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.780]   And even in this country,
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.780]   we've been hearing more and more rumors of our government
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:17.780]   targeting Christians that if you believe in biblical Christianity,
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:21.780]   if you do not submit to the liberal views,
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.780]   and again, that's not a Christianity at all,
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.780]   but if you don't submit to that,
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.780]   we're going to take away your license.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.780]   We're going to take away the ability to be able to do church,
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.780]   your tax exemption plans, and your schools,
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.780]   and even homeschooling.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.780]   Anybody who goes against the indoctrination
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.780]   that the government desires, we're going to come after you.
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.780]   And they're openly saying this.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.780]   For the first time in this country,
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.780]   Christians are actually being targeted.
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.780]   But in comparison to what's going on around the world,
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:54.780]   I mean, we're still living in comfort and safety.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.780]   According to Open Door's ministry,
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.780]   they said over 250 million Christians
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.780]   are severely persecuted around the world today.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.780]   250 million.
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:08.780]   We're not talking about people who are just, you know,
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.780]   living in a place where it's not popular to be a Christian.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.780]   We're not talking about people who just get shunned at work
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.780]   for your faith.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.780]   We're talking about, he says, severe persecution,
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.780]   meaning that you're literally risking your health,
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.780]   your life, your children, your sustenance,
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.780]   in order to follow Christ.
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.780]   250 million Christians.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.780]   One in nine Christians live in intense persecution.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.780]   There's been a 14%, 14% rise
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.780]   in this intense persecution in the last few years.
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.780]   4,136 Christians were martyred for their faith
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.780]   just in 2019, according to record.
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.780]   Martyrs, people who've given their life
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.780]   because they follow Christ.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.780]   Five years ago, North Korea was the only country
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.780]   on the list of the extreme persecuted countries.
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.780]   North Korea.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.780]   Today, there are 11 that fit that category,
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:06.780]   and out of the 11, India has become number 10.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.780]   And the country after that is Iraq.
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.780]   So if you remember, seven, eight years ago,
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.780]   when we first started going out to India,
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.780]   India was ranked number 30 or 32.
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.780]   Every year it's been rising.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.780]   Now they're at number 10.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.760]   So they're in the category of the 11 countries
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.760]   most severely persecuted,
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.760]   meaning that they are literally risking
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.760]   their health and their lives.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.760]   And again, you've heard stories about our pastors there.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.760]   It was tied up and literally left for dead,
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.760]   and so that is not unique to them.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.760]   That's happening to all these pastors
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.760]   who are trying to share the gospel in remote villages.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.760]   But as bad as this situation is,
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.760]   that's not where the rubber meets the road
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.760]   for me and you.
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.760]   When you wake us up and cause us to be concerned,
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.760]   when the government threatens to shut us down
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.760]   because we will not do certain things,
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.760]   and they already tell us that it's coming,
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.760]   that's not where the rubber meets the road.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.760]   Most of us are not shaking in our boots day to day
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.760]   because of the threats that the government's making.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.760]   We feel bad and we pray for the persecuted church
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.760]   all around the world,
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.760]   but that is not the primary problem
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.760]   that you and I face day to day.
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.760]   John Piper describes it this way in "Hunger for God."
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.760]   "The greatest enemy of hunger for God
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.760]   is not poison but apple pie.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.760]   It is not the banquet of the wicked
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.760]   that dulls our appetite for heaven,
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.760]   but endless nibbling at the table of the world.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.760]   It is not the X-rated videos,
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.760]   but the prime-time dribble of triviality
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.760]   we drink in every night."
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.760]   It's not the persecution, it's not ISIS,
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.760]   it's not even our own government
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.760]   that is the greatest problem for us.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.760]   Our greatest source of distraction
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.760]   which destroys the church today,
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.760]   destroys our faith,
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.760]   is the endless, tireless, day-to-day need
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.760]   to be entertained and amused.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   You know, this is probably the only country,
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.760]   at least that I know of,
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.760]   that I hear regularly people are bored with their faith.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.760]   They're bored.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.760]   They're bored because they're comparing it with entertainment.
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:16.760]   It seems exciting, except their faith.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.760]   And part of the reason why is because,
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.760]   just like John Piper says,
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.760]   that we are constantly nibbling at the world.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.760]   We're not feasting at the world,
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.760]   we're nibbling at the world.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.760]   So by the time we come to church,
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   there is no longer an appetite.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.760]   And as I mentioned last week,
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.760]   when people backslide, that does not happen overnight.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.760]   You don't wake up one day and say,
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.760]   "You know what, I don't want to follow Christ anymore."
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.760]   You see a gradual decline of interest toward Christ,
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.760]   a passion for the lost,
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.760]   and then the singing of the songs.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.760]   And when you open up the scriptures,
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.760]   it just seems like dull literature.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.760]   It feels more like homework
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.760]   than feeling like you're being spiritually fed.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.760]   And you see a gradual decline
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.760]   and you just accept it as being normal.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.760]   So a month passes,
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.760]   weeks pass, weeks pass, years pass.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.760]   The next thing you know,
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.760]   you become a great Christian on surface,
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.760]   but inwardly, there is no spiritual hunger.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.760]   You remember what you were like when you were younger,
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   but you become cynical.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.760]   Even when young people are passionate,
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.760]   it's like, "Yeah, I was like you one time.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.760]   "I used to do that when I was young."
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.760]   But you wait until you have kids.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.760]   You wait until you have a job.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.760]   And this is the pattern.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.760]   This is where the church is being destroyed.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.760]   We're not simply being distracted.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.760]   The church is being destroyed,
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.760]   not by persecution, not by ISIS,
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.760]   not by the threat of the governments,
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.760]   but the constant dribble
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:43.760]   of nibbling at the banquet of the world.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.760]   And we will say we're not in the rat race,
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.760]   but every indication is
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.760]   that's exactly the race that we're in.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.760]   We're competing.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.760]   We're perfectly fine with the house that we bought
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.760]   until we see what other person has.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.760]   We're perfectly fine with the retirement fund we had
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.760]   until you hear that your friends have a bigger one.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.760]   We're perfectly fine with what our kids are doing
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:10.760]   until we compare with what other kids are doing.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.760]   And if we are not careful,
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.760]   we drift into this rat race.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.760]   You didn't commit to it.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.760]   You just find yourself one day waking up.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.760]   1 Corinthians 6, 12, it says,
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.760]   "All things are lawful for me,
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.760]   "but not all things are profitable.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.760]   "All things are lawful for me,
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.760]   "but I will not be mastered by anything."
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.760]   In this race, the first thing that he calls us to is not,
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.760]   "Is it sinful?"
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.760]   The second thing he tells us is, "Is it helpful?"
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.760]   Is it helpful?
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.760]   If you've just--
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.760]   if all you did was just sign up to the race
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.760]   and your goal is not to finish the race or to win the race,
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:52.760]   we're just satisfied that we're in the race itself, right?
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.760]   And if you can put up the next slide.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.760]   Right?
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.760]   The next slide.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.760]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.760]   So this is what we would expect runners to look like, right?
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.760]   They got the proper shorts on, right?
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.760]   They're not carrying any backpacks.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.760]   They got the right shoes, right?
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.760]   They got the shirts,
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.760]   and all of them are even wearing tank tops.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.760]   It's not even short sleeve
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   because they don't want anything encumbering them, right?
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.760]   So all they have is a number
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.760]   that shows that they're in the race
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.760]   and everything else, you know, outside of being naked, right,
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.760]   is necessity.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.760]   A long time ago, when they first started the Olympics,
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.760]   they ran naked because they didn't have shorts.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.760]   They didn't have shoes.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.760]   So the only way to run without encumbrance
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.760]   is to take off whatever it was that they had,
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.760]   and they competed in the Olympics.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.760]   They wanted every edge, right?
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.760]   And even the swimmers, some of you guys who swim,
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.760]   you know, those of us who, you know,
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.760]   did experience swimming just casually,
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.760]   you're not that intense, but if you've ever competed,
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   if you've ever known anybody
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.760]   who was, like, really competed as a swimmer, you know,
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.740]   they'll shave off their head if they have to
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.740]   to get that little edge
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.740]   because whatever encumbrance that they have
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.740]   that's gonna slow them down to not to win,
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.740]   you know, it's worth getting rid of, right?
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.740]   This is what we would expect, if you can go to the next slide.
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:20.740]   This guy clearly is not in the race to win.
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.740]   My guess is, you know, he's just having fun
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.740]   or maybe his wife told him to lose some weight
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.740]   and then he signed up, but he really wasn't interested,
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.740]   he just kind of in the race.
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.740]   And then the next guy.
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:35.740]   These guys clearly don't care, right?
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.740]   They're in the race probably to get their picture taken.
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.740]   That's their goal.
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:43.740]   So as soon as this picture is taken,
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.740]   I don't believe they may have finished their race, right?
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.740]   26 miles, I don't think so, right?
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.740]   But you can tell just by what they're wearing
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.740]   they're probably not that serious.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:57.740]   You know, I looked up to see if these marathons have rules
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.740]   and what they can and cannot wear,
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.720]   and I realized that there are some marathons
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.720]   that are very strict.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.720]   You can only have certain things on.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.720]   And there are certain marathons
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.720]   where they don't have any regulations.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.720]   So you can wear this if you want.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.720]   And so if we're asking the question in our pursuit,
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.720]   in our race, is it sinful?
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.720]   And if that's the standard,
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.720]   and if that's the only standard that we use,
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.720]   is it sinful?
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.720]   Then it's just like a marathon runner,
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.720]   it's like, well, is it legal?
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.720]   Like, is there anything in the books
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.720]   that says that I can't be dressed like a chicken?
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.720]   There is no law.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.720]   There's no rule.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.720]   So I can pay it and get the sign,
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.720]   get my picture taken,
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.720]   and I can say that I ran the marathon.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.720]   So on paper you ran the marathon,
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.720]   but you didn't actually run the marathon.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.720]   You just entered the marathon, right?
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.720]   Oftentimes, one of the most common questions
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.720]   that we get is, is it sinful?
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.720]   And the reason why we get that question is,
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.720]   can I do it?
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.720]   How far can I go to the line
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:58.720]   before I cross it?
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:03.720]   And many people are living right on that line.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.720]   And they say, I don't know if that's profitable.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.720]   I don't know if that's helpful.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.720]   It's like, oh, you legalists.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:12.720]   Where in the Bible does it say that?
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.720]   See, the instructions that he's given us
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.720]   in order to run this race with endurance to win,
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.720]   he said, first and foremost,
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.720]   he says, every encumbrance.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.720]   So our standard of running this race to win
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.720]   is, is this helpful?
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.720]   Not is it legal, not is it sinful,
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.720]   but is it helpful?
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.720]   Or does this cause me to slow down?
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.720]   In 1 Peter 2, 1 through 3, it says,
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.720]   therefore putting aside all malice,
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.720]   not some malice, not certain malice
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:42.720]   that bothers you.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.720]   He said, all malice, all deceit,
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.720]   and hypocrisy, and envy, and all slander,
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.720]   like newborn babies long
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:54.720]   for the pure milk of the Word.
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:57.720]   You know, if you've ever been in the room
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.720]   when a child comes into this world,
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.720]   and it's amazing,
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.720]   because first thing that they do
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.720]   is they want food, right?
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.720]   I don't know who taught them, right?
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.720]   They didn't have special training
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.720]   to drink milk,
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.720]   because if you think about it,
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.720]   for nine months,
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.720]   it's been fed to their stomach, right?
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.720]   So they don't know.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.720]   No one's taught them.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:17.720]   It didn't come from training.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.720]   So as soon as they're born,
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.720]   they come sucking, right?
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.720]   So they clean up the baby.
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.720]   They clean the nostrils.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.720]   And one of the first things they did,
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:26.720]   they gave it to the mom,
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.720]   and then the baby comes out
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.720]   wanting to drink.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.720]   How did he know that?
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.720]   Instinctively, the baby is born
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.720]   knowing how to survive.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.720]   He needs to drink.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.720]   And so he's using that
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:41.720]   as an illustration.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.720]   As a child, as a newborn baby,
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.720]   long for the pure milk,
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.720]   because that's the way he's going
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.720]   to live in this world.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.720]   Instinctively.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.720]   He says, when we are spiritually
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.700]   born, he said, we ought to long
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:56.700]   for the milk,
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.700]   not just casually attend, right?
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.700]   Somebody who is satisfied
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.700]   with just having their number
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.700]   on their chest.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.700]   Bible study is just homework,
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.700]   because you're not eagerly
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.700]   trying to find who Christ is
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:12.700]   and to learn to apply
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.700]   and to win this race.
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:15.700]   You're just trying to appease
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:16.700]   other people.
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.700]   "Oh, this church tells me
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:18.700]   I have to do this,
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:19.700]   and this is what's expected,
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.700]   and other people are doing this,
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.700]   and so we're just jumping
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:23.700]   through the hoops to be able
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.700]   to belong in the community
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:26.700]   that I'm in."
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:29.700]   And so it's just homework.
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.700]   There's no life sustenance
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:31.700]   coming from that.
[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.700]   There's no eagerness to know.
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:34.700]   There's no digging
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:35.700]   in the scripture.
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:36.700]   There's no excitement
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:37.700]   to see what the Word of God says.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:38.700]   It's just homework
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.700]   to be done week after week.
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:41.700]   So we just get it done
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:42.700]   and get it over with,
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:43.700]   and then I'm okay
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:44.700]   for the next week.
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:45.700]   That's an individual
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:46.700]   who just has a number
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:47.700]   planted on their chest
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.700]   and say, "I'm in the race too.
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.700]   I'm number 456777.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:57.680]   He's saying run to win.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:58.680]   Our greatest hindrances
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.680]   in our walk with God
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.680]   is not external.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.680]   It is the constant compromise
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.680]   and constant need
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.680]   of being entertained 24/7.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.680]   Ephesians 5.15 says,
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.680]   "Therefore be careful
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.680]   how you walk,
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:14.680]   not as unwise men,
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:15.680]   but as wise,
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.680]   making the most of your time,
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.680]   because the days are evil."
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:25.680]   Making the most of your time.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.680]   You know, one thing I realize
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.680]   is when we get older,
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.680]   I don't know exactly
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.680]   at what age that happens,
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.680]   you start having
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.680]   this old man's mentality.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.680]   "Oh yeah, when I was a kid
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.680]   I did that.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.680]   When you did it,
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.680]   oh, when I was in college
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.680]   I used to do that."
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.680]   And you live off
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:43.680]   of the passion that you had
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   when you were younger
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.680]   and thinking that all
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.680]   that God required of you
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.680]   you've already done.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.680]   Now you're just here
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:51.680]   going to raise kids
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.680]   and I'm going to give my offering
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.680]   and just kind of give in.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.680]   I'm just sitting in the back
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.680]   and you retired spiritually
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.680]   years ago.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:49:59.680]   And there is that temptation
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.680]   when we start to get older
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.680]   just look for retirement.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.680]   I'm just going to rise
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.680]   and I can't wait
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.680]   to get to heaven.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.680]   Not realizing the short time
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.680]   that we have.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.680]   This is the only time
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.680]   that we have
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:12.680]   to share the gospel
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.680]   with the lost,
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.680]   especially the people
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.680]   who are not Christians
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.680]   in our family.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.680]   And then when we're young
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:20.680]   we have a tendency
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.680]   to think we have
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.680]   all the time in the world.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.680]   You know, you can waste
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.680]   a month, a year,
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   maybe even a decade.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.680]   I got you.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.680]   You got the next 10 years.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.680]   It goes by just like that.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.680]   And I know
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.680]   that this is a cliche.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.680]   I know you hear that
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.680]   all the time, right?
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:41.680]   Your parents may have said that.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.680]   The previous generation
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.680]   have said that.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.680]   It really is a myth
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.680]   that comes
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.680]   and it disappears.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.660]   It just goes.
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:53.660]   In Psalm 90 verse 12,
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:54.660]   "And so teach us
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:55.660]   to number our days
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:56.660]   that we may present
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.660]   to you a heart of wisdom."
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.660]   You know what he's saying?
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:01.660]   God, remind me
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:04.660]   that I'm going to die.
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:06.660]   Everything in this world,
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:07.660]   when we pray for people,
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:08.660]   we say, oh,
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.660]   may the Lord bless you
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.660]   and have a wonderful,
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:13.660]   long life in this world.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.660]   That's what we say
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.660]   when we bless others.
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:17.660]   May you have a long
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:18.660]   and prosperous life.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.660]   He's saying, Lord,
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:21.660]   help me to know
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:24.660]   that my life is short.
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:25.660]   Help me to number my days.
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:26.660]   In fact, in James 4, 14,
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:27.660]   it says,
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:28.660]   you do not know
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:29.660]   what your life is going
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:30.660]   to be like tomorrow.
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:31.660]   You are just a vapor
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:32.660]   that appears
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:33.660]   for a little while
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.660]   and then vanishes away.
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.660]   That's depressing.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:39.660]   If you don't really believe
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:40.660]   in eternity,
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:41.660]   this is a depressing thing
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.660]   to come to church
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:43.660]   to be reminded
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:45.660]   you're going to die.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.660]   100%.
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:50.660]   A few of you
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.660]   may have gotten COVID,
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:55.660]   and a few of you got sick,
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.660]   but 100% you're going to die.
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:51:59.660]   God bless you.
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:00.660]   All right.
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:02.660]   Have a wonderful life.
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:03.660]   What a depressing thing to say
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:04.660]   if you don't understand
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:05.660]   the context
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:07.660]   in which he is saying this.
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:08.660]   He's saying,
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:09.660]   help me to number my days
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:10.660]   that we may present to you
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:13.660]   a heart of wisdom,
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:14.660]   that we may have
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.660]   a perspective
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:17.660]   on the race that we're running,
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:20.660]   that this is going to end.
[00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:21.660]   There is a finish line.
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:22.660]   Which finish line
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:24.660]   are we trying to cross?
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:25.660]   Which race
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:27.660]   are we competing in?
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:28.660]   What are the values
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:29.660]   that we are pursuing?
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:31.660]   Are we in the rat race
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:34.660]   in the name of Jesus?
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:35.660]   Are we actually running
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.660]   this race that is set
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.660]   before us by Christ?
[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:39.660]   That's why
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.660]   in numbering our days,
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:41.660]   knowing that we're just here
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:42.660]   temporarily,
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:43.660]   that we invest
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.660]   in eternal things,
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:46.660]   not simply
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:47.660]   the temporary things.
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:49.660]   We need to be wise.
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:50.660]   It's not saying
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:52.660]   that you can't have nice things,
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:53.660]   but in our pursuit,
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:56.660]   what do we value the most?
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:57.660]   You know,
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:01.660]   whenever we go to India,
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:02.660]   we have regulations
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.660]   for people, right?
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:05.660]   Because it's a very
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:06.660]   conservative culture,
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:07.660]   we have to tell the ladies
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.660]   you have to wear a skirt, right?
[00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:10.660]   And I know skirts
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:11.660]   are not popular.
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:12.660]   I don't know how many of you
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:13.660]   are wearing skirts today,
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:14.640]   but people just don't
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.640]   wear skirts today, right?
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:17.640]   And it can't be a mini skirt.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:18.640]   It has to be a skirt
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.640]   all the way down
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.640]   to your ankles.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.640]   They can't see your feet, right?
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.640]   And on top of that,
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.640]   you have to wear a scarf.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:26.640]   You have to wear a scarf
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:27.640]   wherever you're indoors.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:28.640]   You have to wear the scarf
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.640]   at all times
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.640]   or they get offended.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.640]   And you can't have
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:32.640]   a one-to-one conversation
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.640]   with men
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.640]   unless you're in a crowd.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.640]   I mean, it's a very
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.640]   conservative country.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.640]   Even for the guys,
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.640]   even if it's 105 degrees,
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.640]   I can't wear shorts.
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.640]   I have to wear long pants
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.640]   and I have to wear
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.640]   conservative clothes
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.640]   even if we're sweating it out.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:48.640]   I've never had anybody
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.640]   on our team say,
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:52.640]   "Well, there's nothing
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.640]   in the Bible that says that.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.640]   I have freedom in Christ.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.640]   I'm not going to wear this scarf.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.640]   How dare they?"
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:03.640]   Male chauvinist pigs.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.640]   I mean, it's 105 degrees outside.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.640]   I'm not going to wear jeans.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.640]   I'm not going to wear long pants.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.640]   I've never had anybody
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:12.640]   struggle with that.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.640]   It's like, "Okay, what else?
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.640]   What else?"
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.640]   If they give you this,
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:16.640]   make sure you take it.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:17.640]   You know, don't shake your hands
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:18.640]   with your left hand.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.640]   There's all these rules
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:20.640]   that we follow
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.640]   for one purpose
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:23.640]   because we want to be effective
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.640]   in sharing the gospel.
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:26.640]   So we don't want anything
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.640]   that's going to hinder this race,
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.640]   anything that's going to make us
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.640]   ineffective where they're going
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:32.640]   to be offended
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.640]   or it's going to be awkward
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:35.640]   and then cause us
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.640]   not to be able to share it
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.640]   effectively.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.640]   But for whatever the reason,
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:41.640]   when we come back home,
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.640]   we turn that off.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:45.640]   And the common question is,
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:46.640]   "Well, I mean,
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.640]   where did the Bible say that?"
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.640]   So all of a sudden,
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.640]   our standard of what we choose
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:52.640]   is right and wrong,
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.640]   all of a sudden gets turned on
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.640]   and turned off
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.640]   when we come home.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.640]   Why is that?
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:01.640]   It's because when we are
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:02.640]   going out to India,
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.640]   we have a wartime mentality.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   We're going into a fight.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.640]   We're going into war
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:08.640]   to bring people to Christ
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.640]   and whatever is going
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:10.640]   to hinder that,
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.640]   we're willing to give up.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.640]   Any encumbrance,
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:16.640]   anything that I do or say
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.640]   that's going to be offensive
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:18.640]   to somebody there
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.640]   that I want to share the gospel,
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.640]   and so he raises the standard
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:23.640]   so that there will be
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:24.640]   no encumbrance.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.640]   But for whatever the reason,
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.640]   when we come home,
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:27.640]   we're not struggling
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:29.640]   in this battle anymore.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:31.640]   I'm free.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.640]   He died for us
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.640]   so that I can have liberty.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:34.640]   I have the freedom
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.640]   and all of a sudden,
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.640]   my freedom supersedes
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.640]   anything else.
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:40.640]   Don't judge me.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:41.640]   If you're in a position
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.640]   constantly saying,
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.640]   "They're judging me.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.640]   They're judging me,"
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.640]   my guess is
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:47.640]   they're judging you
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.640]   for a reason.
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:50.640]   That's my guess.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.640]   I could be wrong.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.640]   Probably not.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.640]   If you're in a habit,
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.640]   if your life is constantly,
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:57.640]   "They're judging me.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:58.640]   They're judging me,"
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:59.640]   at least take a step back
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:00.640]   and ask yourself
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:01.640]   what is it that you're doing
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.640]   that's causing them
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:05.640]   to judge you?
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.640]   What is it that you're--
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:07.640]   How are you running this race?
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.640]   How are you living this life
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.640]   that makes it seem like
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.640]   you're not that interested?
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.640]   You can't have a chicken suit
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:14.640]   running this race
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:15.640]   and then say, "Hey,
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:16.640]   I don't know if that's
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.640]   going to be helpful.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.640]   Don't judge me."
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:20.640]   I don't know if you should
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.640]   be wearing high heels.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.640]   Where does it say?
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:26.640]   Where does it say
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.640]   I can't wear heels?
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:29.640]   There's no law on that.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.640]   But clearly,
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   you're not that serious
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.640]   about running this race.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:34.640]   So he said first and foremost,
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:35.640]   he says he's not to examine
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.640]   the sins but examine
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:37.640]   every encumbrance
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.640]   that gets in our way
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   to run this race
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.640]   with endurance
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:43.640]   to make sure
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:44.640]   that we're running
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:45.640]   the right race.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:46.640]   We're running it to win
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.640]   not just casually
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.640]   have signed up.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:49.640]   Secondly, he says
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:51.640]   to throw off the sin.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.640]   Throw it off.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.640]   He's not checking away.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:56.640]   He says throw it off
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:57.640]   every sin
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.640]   that's so easily entangled.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:00.640]   These are sins
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:01.640]   that are constantly stumbling us
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   repeatedly
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.640]   over and over again.
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:06.640]   Easily entangles.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.640]   Those sins
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:09.640]   that are constantly near.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.640]   Coveting.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:15.640]   The thing that we struggle with
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:16.640]   especially us
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:17.640]   being a young church
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:18.640]   is that pornography
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.640]   has become so prevalent
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.640]   and almost even acceptable
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.640]   because it's spoken of
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.640]   so freely
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.640]   in the media.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.640]   So if you don't watch porn
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:32.640]   you're weird.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.640]   Before it was like
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.640]   oh you're a virgin?
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:36.620]   You're 20 years old
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:37.620]   and you're a virgin?
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.620]   Now it's like
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:39.620]   what? You don't watch porn?
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:40.620]   What's wrong with you?
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:41.620]   You prude.
[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:43.620]   So it's almost weird
[00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:44.620]   for people
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:46.620]   not to be watching porn
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.620]   if you are in a secular arena
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:49.620]   in any way
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:50.620]   and that's kind of slowly
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:51.620]   crept into the church
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:52.620]   where it's become
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:53.620]   an acceptable sin.
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:54.620]   Oh everybody sins.
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:55.620]   Oh struggle.
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:56.620]   Where I think
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:57.620]   in the previous generation
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:58.620]   when we said
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:57:59.620]   we were struggling
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:00.620]   we just meant that we had
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:02.620]   impure thoughts
[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:03.620]   that we struggle.
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:04.620]   Maybe something that we saw
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:05.620]   years ago
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:06.600]   and it's kind of being
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:07.600]   replayed in our head.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:08.600]   Today when young people
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:09.600]   say they're struggling
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.600]   they're in porn
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.600]   in hard porn
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:13.600]   day to day
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.600]   and say oh I'm just struggling.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.600]   If that's a pattern
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:17.600]   in your life
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:18.600]   you're not struggling.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:20.600]   You've given in.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:21.600]   Struggling is
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:22.600]   trying to get out.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.600]   Struggling is
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.600]   working
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.600]   and confessing
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.600]   and laboring
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.600]   asking for accountability.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:28.600]   That's struggling.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:29.600]   If you've accepted
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.600]   a certain amount
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.600]   of pornography
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.600]   in your life
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.600]   you're not struggling.
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.600]   You've accepted it.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.580]   You've allowed it.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.580]   You're okay with it.
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:40.580]   You've justified it.
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:41.580]   He says
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:42.580]   every sin
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:44.580]   that so easily entangles
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:45.580]   but again
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.580]   our struggle isn't just porn.
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:48.580]   Even though porn is an issue
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:49.580]   before it was just
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:50.580]   you know for the most part
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:51.580]   it was men
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:52.580]   but now even women
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:53.580]   are struggling with
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:55.580]   because it's in our pockets.
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:56.580]   And I thank God
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:58.580]   that I wasn't a teenager
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.580]   in this period
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:01.580]   you know
[00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:02.580]   and we pray for you guys
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:03.580]   and again
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:04.580]   this is not just for young people
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:05.580]   but especially for younger ones.
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:07.580]   The fact that you have access
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:08.580]   to anything that you want
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:09.580]   on this phone
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:11.580]   at any time.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:12.580]   The temptation
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:13.580]   that you guys are in
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.580]   are intense.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:15.580]   This is not something
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:16.580]   that you can conquer
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:17.580]   just by saying
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:18.580]   oh I'm struggling.
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:19.580]   And then next week
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:20.580]   you come
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:21.580]   I'm struggling.
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:22.580]   A week after that
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:23.580]   I'm struggling.
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:24.580]   Say no
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:25.580]   after about a month
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.580]   of that you're not struggling.
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:28.580]   You've accepted it.
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:29.580]   You've allowed a certain amount
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.580]   of it in your life
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:32.580]   and you're okay with it.
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:33.580]   He says
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.580]   to struggle
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.560]   is a form of porn.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.560]   You're looking at Facebook
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.560]   and Instagram
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:40.560]   and TikTok
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:41.560]   and whatever else is out there
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.560]   and they're constantly
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:43.560]   presenting
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:44.560]   the perfect life.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.560]   The rat race.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:47.560]   Right.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.560]   Where before we would hear about it
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.560]   or we go to someone else's house
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.560]   and we see it
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:51.560]   but now it's on your phone
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:52.560]   constantly.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.560]   Oh I want to eat that.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.560]   Oh I want to have that.
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.560]   Oh I want to go there.
[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:59.560]   Oh I want to have this.
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.560]   I want to buy this.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.560]   When is Disneyland opening?
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.560]   Right.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.540]   Constantly.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:07.540]   The constant things
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:09.540]   that distract us
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:12.540]   get our minds off of Christ
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:13.540]   so that there is no longer
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.540]   any appetite for Christ
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.540]   and so we covet in our hearts
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:18.540]   and we're living
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.540]   every day coveting.
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:21.540]   Oh I'm going to get this.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.540]   If I save enough money
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:23.540]   I'm going to get this.
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:24.540]   Oh if I save money
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:25.540]   I'm going to do this.
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.540]   I'm going to go here
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.540]   and so what has filled our hearts
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:28.540]   is constant coveting
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.540]   that we've allowed.
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:33.540]   We've allowed day to day
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:34.540]   every single day
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:35.540]   so that our mind
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.540]   is no longer consumed
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:37.540]   with the things of God
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:38.540]   but they're consumed
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.540]   with this rat race.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:40.540]   This bucket list
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:41.540]   that we've made
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:42.540]   that has nothing to do
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.540]   with Christ.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:47.540]   The sin that so easily entangles.
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.540]   In Psalm 39
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:50.540]   139, 23, 24
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.540]   Search me O God
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.540]   and know my heart.
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:54.540]   Try me and know
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:55.540]   my anxious thoughts
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.540]   and see if there be
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.540]   any hurtful way in me
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.540]   and lead me in
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.540]   the everlasting way.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:02.540]   You see this prayer
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.540]   is not enough.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.540]   If you are a religious person
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:08.540]   and you have the right number
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:09.540]   and you happen to be
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.540]   a little bit ahead of other people
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.540]   that's enough
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.540]   and you spend the rest of the time
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.540]   ridiculing the people
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:16.540]   who aren't running as fast as you.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.540]   You may have the chicken suit
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.540]   on yourself
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:20.540]   but your whole focus
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:21.540]   is not to win this race
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.540]   but your whole focus is
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.540]   I'm better.
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:26.540]   I'm running faster than you.
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:27.540]   But you're not carefully
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:30.540]   searching your own heart.
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.540]   As long as you're doing Bible study
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:32.540]   as long as you're tithing
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:33.520]   as long as you're active
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.520]   but in your heart
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.520]   there's judgmentalism
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.520]   there's bitterness
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.520]   there's slander
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.520]   and we're not aware of that.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.520]   Other people's sin
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.520]   is a stink
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.520]   but you know
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.520]   the odor that's near us
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.520]   we just kind of
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:47.520]   gotten used to it
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.520]   and we think it's okay.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.520]   See the psalmist comes before
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.520]   and says search me.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.520]   The word of God
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.520]   judge the thoughts
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.520]   and intentions of my heart.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.520]   It's not given to us
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.520]   it's like hey
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.520]   I got these verses
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.520]   that you need.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.520]   You know I did this Bible study
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.520]   you need these.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.520]   Oh man
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.520]   this would be a great sermon
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.520]   for that guy to hear.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.520]   Search me
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.520]   oh God
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.520]   and know my heart.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.520]   Try me
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.520]   test me
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.520]   know my anxious thoughts.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.520]   See if there's any hurtful ways in me.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.520]   Right.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.520]   Even my heart
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.520]   my attitude.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.520]   If you can put up
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.520]   the next slide
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.520]   some of you guys
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.520]   may have seen this before
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.520]   everyone has four areas
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.520]   of their life.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.520]   Right.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.520]   The first area
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.520]   is me and others.
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:32.520]   That's your public life.
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.520]   That's your presentation.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.520]   Right.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.520]   They see
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.520]   what how you look like
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.520]   how you behave
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.520]   are you an introvert
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:39.520]   are you extrovert
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.520]   that's your public life.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.520]   Right.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.520]   Most of us
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.520]   spend the most of our energy
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.520]   on that part
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.520]   because you get judged
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.520]   right away.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:49.520]   You're a jerk.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.520]   People say you're a jerk.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.520]   Okay maybe I shouldn't be a jerk.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.520]   That's that's your public life.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.520]   Right.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.520]   Maybe the way you talk
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.520]   the way you present yourself
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.520]   and so
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.520]   when we think about sanctification
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.500]   that's usually where
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.500]   people put the most attention.
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:04.500]   Right.
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.500]   That's why
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.500]   sometimes prayer life
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.500]   kind of gets the back burner
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.500]   because we don't walk out
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.500]   with a you know
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.500]   I prayed this much today.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.500]   No one sees it
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.500]   whether you played hours
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.500]   two hours or you prayed none
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.500]   no one sees it.
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.500]   But when you
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:18.500]   do certain things
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.500]   about the Bible
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.500]   it's like oh yeah I did this
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.500]   and I did that.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:22.500]   So we have a
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:23.500]   we have a tendency
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.500]   if we're not careful
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.500]   to give all our attention
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.500]   to that area.
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.500]   But the second area
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.500]   is your private life
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.500]   me only.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.500]   They wouldn't know
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.500]   if you don't confess it.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:34.500]   Right.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.500]   You could be struggling with porn
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:36.500]   but on the outside
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:37.500]   you're doing great.
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.500]   You know you're leading
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.500]   you're telling
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.500]   you're serving
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.500]   but your private life
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.500]   and this is an area
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.500]   that others would not know
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.500]   unless you revealed it.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.500]   You brought it to light
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.500]   because they don't know
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.500]   it's there.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:50.500]   And that's why the Bible says
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.500]   to confess your sins
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.500]   to one another.
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:53.500]   So if you're an individual
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.500]   who genuinely
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.500]   is running this race
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.500]   and you want to compete to win
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.500]   you have to go beyond
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.500]   just the surface
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.500]   and seek accountability
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.500]   in areas
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.500]   and to confess your sins
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.500]   and hey I need help.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.500]   You know I'm struggling
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.500]   with porn
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.500]   can you keep me accountable.
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.500]   And so that's your private life
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.500]   and it doesn't have to be
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.500]   just with porn.
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.500]   If you're struggling
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.500]   with materialism
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:15.500]   if you're struggling
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.500]   with competing
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.500]   if you're struggling
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.500]   with bitterness and anger
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:19.500]   that maybe you've done
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.500]   a good job
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.500]   to cover that up.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.500]   You confess your sins
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.500]   and ask for accountability
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.500]   and run this race together.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.500]   Third area
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.500]   is the others only.
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.500]   That's your blind spot.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.500]   This is an area
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.500]   that others see
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:34.500]   better than you.
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.500]   And this is an area
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:37.500]   that no one likes
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.500]   to be pointed out.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:39.500]   Right.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.500]   So that's why
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.500]   it's so hard at home
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:43.500]   because your parents
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.500]   probably know this
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.500]   really well.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.500]   You know.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.500]   You may have done
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:49.500]   a great job presenting
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.500]   on the outside
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.500]   but your parents
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.500]   kind of like
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.500]   hey what about this.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:55.500]   It's like I don't
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.500]   want to hear it.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.500]   Your siblings will say it
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.500]   and then usually
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.500]   they'll say it in a way
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.500]   that you don't like it.
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.500]   And then you come
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:02.500]   to church or a community
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:03.500]   and other people
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.500]   begin to kind of
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.500]   hey what about this.
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.500]   How about this.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:09.500]   And so what ends up happening
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.500]   you're a Christian
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.500]   so you can't say I hate you.
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.500]   You're a Christian
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.500]   because that will ruin
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:15.500]   your public life.
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:16.500]   Right.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.500]   So what ends up doing
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.500]   is these are my acquaintances.
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.500]   Right.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.500]   You stay where you are.
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.500]   You stay where you are.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.500]   I don't want to be
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.500]   in your small group.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.500]   I don't want to be near you.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.500]   I don't want to go where you are.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.500]   Right.
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:28.500]   We keep a distance
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:29.500]   but I'm a Christian
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.500]   so I can't hate your guts.
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:32.500]   But we've done that
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.500]   until we get married
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.500]   and all of a sudden
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.500]   our husband starts
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.500]   to poke at it
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:37.500]   or your wife begins
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.500]   to poke at it.
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.500]   And so in the past
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:41.500]   you just kind of shun people
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.500]   and kept them at a distance
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.500]   but you can't do that anymore
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.500]   with your wife and husband.
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:46.500]   And that's where
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.500]   the strife comes in.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:48.500]   And that's an area
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:49.500]   where others only
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.500]   that's your blind spot
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.500]   that we not only
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.500]   need to openly confess
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.500]   our sins
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.500]   but be willing to be corrected
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.500]   by others when they say.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:58.500]   So if you're constantly saying
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:05:59.500]   every time somebody
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.500]   says something you don't like
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.500]   you say, "Ah, stop touching me."
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.500]   Maybe you should take
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:04.500]   a step back and ask
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.500]   why do they keep saying this?
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.500]   Because that may be
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.500]   your blind spot.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:10.500]   So when an individual
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.500]   comes before God
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.500]   and asks,
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.500]   "Search me and know me."
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:15.500]   You're opening yourself up
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.500]   saying, "Lord, what is it
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.500]   in my life that is hindering me
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:19.500]   that maybe I know of
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:20.500]   that I'm hiding from other people.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:21.500]   Maybe I don't know of
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:22.500]   that other people
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:23.500]   have been trying to tell me.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.500]   Search me and know me.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.500]   What are the hindrances?
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.500]   What are the sins
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.500]   that so easily entangles?"
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.500]   And then there's an area
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.500]   of our life that only God knows.
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.500]   This is our hidden life.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:35.500]   These are the things
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.500]   that we don't even know ourselves
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.500]   and other people don't see.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:39.500]   And when you get married
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:40.500]   and have children
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.500]   you have no idea
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.500]   what kind of mother
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:43.500]   you would have been.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:44.500]   So this is an area
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.500]   where all
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.500]   when all four areas
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:47.500]   are exposed to God
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.500]   and we're asking God,
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.500]   "Lord, search me."
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.500]   Then that's an individual
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.500]   who truly is trying
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.500]   to run this race
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.500]   and to win.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.500]   Any encumbrance,
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.500]   anything,
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.500]   any sin that easily entangles.
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.500]   In Matthew 24, verse 7,
[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:03.500]   it says, "Because lawlessness
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:04.500]   will increase,
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:05.500]   most people's love
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.500]   will grow cold."
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.500]   You ever think about why
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.500]   with the increase of lawlessness
[01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.500]   most people's love grow cold?
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:14.500]   You would think that
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:15.500]   because of wickedness
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.500]   that the church would be on fire.
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.500]   But he says, "No,
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.500]   most will grow cold."
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:21.500]   Why does it grow cold?
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.500]   Because there's compromise.
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.500]   In order to have
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:26.500]   some of the world
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.500]   and some of God
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.500]   and the more that they shift
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.500]   further away from God,
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:32.500]   you have to move
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:33.500]   further away from God too
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.500]   in order to have both
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:35.500]   or in your mind to have both.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.500]   And that's why
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.500]   the increase of wickedness
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:38.500]   causes the love
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:39.500]   of most people
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.500]   will grow cold.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:41.500]   Meaning,
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.500]   most people are living
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.500]   compromised already.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.500]   Most people are running
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.500]   the rat race
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.500]   and they've convinced themselves
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.500]   that they're not.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.500]   That's why when
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:52.500]   the wickedness increases
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.500]   we just naturally
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.500]   shift that direction.
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:55.500]   We drift toward
[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.500]   that direction.
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.500]   1 Timothy 1, 18-19,
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.500]   Paul tells Timothy,
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.500]   "I entrust to you, Timothy,
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.500]   my son, in accordance
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.500]   with the prophecies
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.500]   previously made concern you
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.500]   that by them
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.500]   you fight the good fight."
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.500]   He calls them to fight.
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.500]   Let me ask you,
[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.500]   would you say you're fighting
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.500]   for your faith?
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.500]   Or did you just sign up?
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.500]   You just happen to be
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:23.500]   on this boat
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.500]   that's coasting somewhere.
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.500]   What are you fighting for?
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.500]   Are you fighting
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:29.500]   to make the right investment?
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.500]   Are you fighting
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.500]   so that your children
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:32.500]   would be healthy
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.500]   and wealthy?
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.500]   Are you fighting
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.500]   to have better retirement?
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:38.500]   What are you fighting for?
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:41.500]   Are we genuinely fighting?
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.500]   You know, when it says
[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.500]   in Matthew 18, 8-9,
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:44.500]   I'm not going to read it
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.500]   for you,
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:46.500]   but in that passage
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.500]   where it says,
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.500]   "If your arm causes you
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.500]   to sin, cut it off.
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.500]   If your eyes causes you
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:54.500]   to continue to stumble,
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.500]   gouge it out."
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:56.500]   I mean, wow,
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.500]   that's pretty violent.
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.500]   That's pretty gruesome.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.500]   The point that Jesus
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.500]   was trying to make
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.500]   is that's how much
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:03.500]   he hates sin.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:04.500]   That's how much he hates sin.
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.500]   God did not hate sin
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.500]   in the Old Testament
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:08.500]   and was fine with it
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.500]   in the New Testament.
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.500]   In fact, there's more required
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:12.500]   in the New Testament
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:13.500]   because we've been given
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.500]   more in the New Testament
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.500]   than the Old Testament since.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.500]   Because now we see clearly
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.500]   what Christ has done.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.500]   Knowing everything
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.500]   that we know
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:21.500]   and we say,
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:22.500]   "Ah, okay, whatever."
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.500]   Right?
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.500]   Every once in a while
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.500]   we'll talk to a young guy
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.500]   who's struggling with porn
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:30.500]   and say,
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.500]   "Hey, you know,
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.500]   why don't we put
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.500]   Covenant Eyes on?"
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:35.500]   So you guys know
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:36.500]   who Covenant Eyes is.
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:37.500]   You put it on the computer
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.500]   and it kind of keeps
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:39.500]   each other accountable
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.500]   and shows other people
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.500]   what they're watching.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:43.500]   And every once in a while
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.500]   we'll get the answer,
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.500]   "I don't want that
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.500]   because it slows down
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:51.500]   my computer."
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.500]   So this sin of pornography
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.500]   is acceptable
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.500]   but a slow computer is not.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.500]   You're not serious.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.500]   So what you mean is
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.500]   you don't like--
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.500]   you want to conquer this sin,
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.500]   the easiest path possible
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:07.500]   with the least sacrifice,
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.500]   enjoying everything
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.500]   that I enjoy
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.500]   and I want this gone too.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.500]   It doesn't exist.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.500]   It does not exist.
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.480]   That statement in and of itself
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.480]   is like
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.480]   fast computers
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.480]   are more important to me
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.480]   than purity.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.480]   Having easy access
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.480]   to everything that I need
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.480]   on the internet
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.480]   is more important to me
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:31.480]   than my walk with God.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.480]   And that's why he says
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.480]   if these sins cause you
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.480]   to continually,
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.480]   repeatedly sin,
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.480]   he says we need to struggle
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.480]   even to the point
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.480]   of shedding blood.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.480]   That's what he says
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.480]   in Hebrews 12, verse 4.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.480]   You have not yet resisted
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:46.480]   to the point of shedding blood
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.480]   in your striving against sin
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.480]   and you have forgotten
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.480]   the exhortation
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.480]   which is addressed to you
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.480]   as sons.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.480]   My son, do not regard lightly
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.480]   the discipline of the Lord
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.480]   nor faith when you are
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.480]   reproved by him
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:58.480]   for those whom the Lord loves.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480]   He disciplines
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480]   and he scourges every son
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.480]   whom he receives.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.480]   If you are allowing
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.480]   the sin to easily entangle
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.480]   and exist in your life,
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.480]   you are doing two things.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.480]   One, either you are waiting
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.480]   for the discipline
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.480]   of God to come
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.480]   or you are waiting
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:16.480]   for the discipline
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.480]   of sin to come.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.480]   You are allowing sin
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.480]   where because of the love
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.480]   of Christ,
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.480]   discipline will come
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.480]   or you're proving
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.480]   that you don't believe
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.480]   to begin with.
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.480]   So it doesn't matter.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.480]   Even if I live in sin,
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.480]   what matters is
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.480]   what you think of me.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.480]   What matters is
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.480]   where I belong
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.480]   in this community.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.480]   What matters is
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.480]   that I feel a sense of safety
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:39.480]   but what God thinks
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.480]   doesn't matter
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.480]   because I don't really believe.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:43.480]   So it's either one
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.480]   or the other.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.480]   And either place
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.480]   is not safe.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.480]   Every sin
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.480]   that we are so easily
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.480]   entangled with.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.480]   In Matthew Chapter 6,
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.480]   11-13,
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.480]   I want you to pay
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.480]   very close attention
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.480]   to this Lord's Prayer
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.480]   that we all know
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.480]   and many of you
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.480]   have memorized
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.480]   and you may not have
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.480]   really understood
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.480]   what you were saying.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.480]   He says,
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:08.480]   "Give us to stay
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.480]   our daily bread."
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.480]   Give us to stay
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.480]   our daily bread
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.480]   meaning I'm going
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.480]   to depend on you.
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:14.460]   Don't give me wealth
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:15.460]   so that I can have abundance
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:16.460]   in my bank account.
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:17.460]   Give me to stay
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.460]   our daily bread.
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.460]   Right?
[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.460]   When you're praying that,
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.460]   you're not praying for wealth.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.460]   You're not praying for safety.
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.460]   You're not praying
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.460]   for comfort.
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:26.460]   You're not praying
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:27.460]   for retirement.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:28.460]   You're praying
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.460]   that you would have
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:30.460]   just enough
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:31.460]   that you would depend
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.460]   on Him daily.
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.460]   Right?
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.460]   So you weren't praying
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.460]   for long safe life.
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:39.460]   Give me this day
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:41.460]   our daily bread.
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.460]   Right?
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.460]   You sure you want to pray
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.460]   that prayer?
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:46.460]   And forgive us our debts
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.460]   as we have forgiven
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:49.460]   our debtors.
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:50.460]   Right?
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:51.460]   As we have forgiven
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:52.460]   our debtors.
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:53.460]   If we refuse to forgive
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:54.460]   other people
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:55.460]   and then you say,
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:56.460]   "Lord, forgive me
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:57.460]   of my sins
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.460]   but punish them
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:00.460]   for their sins."
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.460]   You can't pray that prayer.
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.460]   You can't.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.460]   He says,
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:05.460]   "When you come before God
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.460]   asking for forgiveness,"
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.460]   He says,
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:10.460]   "as I have forgiven them."
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:11.460]   So you can't ask
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.460]   for forgiveness
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:14.460]   if you're unwilling
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.460]   to forgive.
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:17.460]   Did you know that
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:18.460]   you were praying that?
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.460]   Here's a third.
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:21.460]   "Do not lead us
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:22.460]   into temptation
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:23.460]   but deliver us
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.460]   from evil."
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:26.460]   You notice here
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:27.460]   he says,
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:28.460]   he doesn't simply say
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:31.460]   deliver us from sin.
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.460]   He says,
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.460]   "Deliver us from temptation.
[01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:35.460]   Deliver us from anything
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:36.460]   that's going to tempt me
[01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.460]   away from you."
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.460]   So you know when you pray
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:40.460]   that prayer,
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.460]   you're asking,
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:43.460]   "If this girl,
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:45.460]   if this guy
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:46.460]   is going to tempt me
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:47.460]   away from you,
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:50.460]   deliver me.
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:53.460]   Take me away from this."
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:55.460]   If this business
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:56.460]   is going to make you
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:58.460]   a lot of money,
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:13:59.460]   is going to tempt you
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.460]   away from Christ,
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:02.460]   you're asking God
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:03.460]   to deliver you.
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:04.460]   Take that money away
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:05.460]   from me.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.460]   If this house
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:07.460]   that you're going to buy
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:09.460]   is going to tempt you away
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.460]   your heart's going to be filled
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:12.460]   with desires
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:13.460]   that have nothing to do
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:14.460]   with Christ.
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:15.460]   This Lord's prayer
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:16.460]   is asking,
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:18.460]   "Lord, take that away from me.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.460]   Take that away from me.
[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:22.460]   Deliver me from temptation.
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.460]   Lead me not into temptation."
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.460]   So when you're asking
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:26.460]   this prayer,
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:27.460]   you are praying
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:29.460]   that your primary thing
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:30.460]   that you desire
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:31.460]   more than anything else
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:32.460]   is to depend on Him,
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:35.460]   to practice forgiveness,
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:36.460]   and to take off
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:38.460]   all encumbrance
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:44.460]   and all sin that entangles.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:45.460]   Did you know
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.460]   that you were praying that?
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:48.460]   Did you know
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:49.460]   that you were praying
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:50.460]   that you may be praying
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:52.460]   for poverty?
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:53.460]   You may be praying
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:54.460]   for sickness
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:55.460]   because maybe
[01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:56.460]   your health is causing you
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:58.460]   to be proud.
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:00.460]   Maybe your fat bank account
[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:01.460]   and your nice life
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:02.460]   is causing your heart
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:04.460]   to draw away from Christ.
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:05.460]   And so you're praying,
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:07.460]   "Deliver me from this temptation."
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.460]   Whatever temptation
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.460]   that you allow in your life
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:11.460]   that causes you
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:12.460]   to have your heart
[01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:13.460]   be hardened,
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:17.460]   "Lord, deliver me from this."
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:18.460]   If you're not running
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:20.460]   the race that's before us,
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.460]   you do not want
[01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:23.460]   to pray this prayer
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:24.460]   because you don't want God
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:26.460]   to answer this prayer.
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.460]   You can only pray this prayer
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:30.460]   if you actually mean this,
[01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:33.460]   if you're running this race.
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:35.460]   There's a story of a man
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.460]   who was struggling
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:39.460]   with purity
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:40.460]   and he decided to go
[01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:42.460]   to a bar where he knew
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:43.460]   that he was going to be solicited
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:44.460]   by prostitutes
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.460]   and he was sitting there
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.460]   by himself and a lady
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:47.460]   taps him on the shoulder,
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.460]   soliciting him,
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.460]   turns around
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:51.460]   and she's not very attractive.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.460]   So he turns around
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:53.460]   and prays,
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:54.460]   "Lord, deliver me
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.460]   from this evil."
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.460]   So she disappears.
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.460]   Second one comes,
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.460]   taps him on the shoulder,
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:00.460]   and soliciting him,
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:01.460]   he turns around
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.460]   and she's very attractive.
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:04.460]   But this time he turns around
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.460]   and says, "Lord,
[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:09.460]   let your will be done."
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:10.460]   He's already compromised
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:13.460]   when he went there.
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:14.460]   He's already determined
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:15.460]   in his heart
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:17.460]   that that's what he wants.
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:18.460]   See, so many of us
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:20.460]   live in this juxtaposition
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:22.460]   of I want it all,
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.460]   I'm going to have it all,
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.460]   I'm going to keep it all,
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:28.460]   and I'm going to go after all,
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:29.460]   but the Lord
[01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.460]   deliver me from this evil.
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:34.460]   Let your will be done.
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:35.440]   Like I want to be pure,
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.440]   but I don't want to have
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.440]   a slow computer.
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.440]   I want to honor Christ
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.440]   and I want to live all for Christ,
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.440]   but Lord protect all
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.440]   that I have.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.440]   Protect all that I have,
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:48.440]   all my children,
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.440]   everything that I have,
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.440]   that it would be
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.440]   under your umbrella of blessing.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.440]   When he says every encumbrance,
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.440]   every sin that easily entangles,
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.440]   the standard that we ought
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.440]   to be asking is
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.440]   are we committed to this?
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.440]   What fight are we fighting?
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:04.440]   And part of the reason
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.440]   why people don't ask
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.440]   and they don't have a problem
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.440]   going to India
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.440]   and giving it all up
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:12.440]   is because they recognize
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.440]   that we're in a battle.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.440]   Soldiers who are going
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:17.440]   into battle are not worried
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.440]   about the fluffiness
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.440]   of their pillow
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.440]   because the only
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.440]   single-minded focus is
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.440]   is this going to help me
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.440]   in this battle
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:27.440]   or is this going to hinder me
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.440]   in this battle?
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.440]   And so that's what
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.440]   he's calling us to.
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.440]   It's because they were
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:34.440]   drifting back to a civilian life
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.440]   and that's why he tells Paul.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.440]   Paul tells Timothy
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.440]   to run in such a way
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.440]   not to live like a civilian
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.440]   as a good soldier of Christ
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.440]   to persevere.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.440]   So let me finish with this
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.440]   in Psalm 119 verse 9 through 11
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:53.440]   it says,
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:54.440]   "How can a young man
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.440]   keep his way pure
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.440]   by keeping it according
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.440]   to your word
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.440]   with all my heart
[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:02.440]   I have sought you.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.440]   Do not let me wander
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.440]   from your commandments
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.440]   your word I have treasured
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.440]   in my heart
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.440]   that I may not sin
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.440]   against you."
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.440]   Is that, can you say
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.440]   that that's your prayer?
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.440]   With all my heart
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:19.440]   I have sought you.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.440]   The problem again
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:21.440]   the temptation,
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:22.440]   the struggle that you
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.440]   and I have in this
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.440]   where we live,
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.440]   yeah we're seeking God
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.440]   but not with all our heart.
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.420]   We pray but not with urgency.
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:35.420]   We share the gospel
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:38.420]   but we're not desperate.
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:40.420]   We're just doing it.
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:41.420]   There's a difference
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:43.420]   if you've raised children
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.420]   when a child wants his mom
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:46.420]   or dad,
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:47.420]   you know,
[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:48.420]   you ever get on the airplane
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:49.420]   and this child is like
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:50.420]   "Mommy!"
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:51.420]   and then the parents
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.420]   just kind of shut it off.
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:54.420]   Right?
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.420]   And then, you know,
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:56.420]   if you don't have kids
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.420]   you kind of like,
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:58.420]   you know,
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.420]   you get very impatient.
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:01.420]   "What's wrong with these parents?"
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:03.420]   "Shut that kid up!"
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:04.420]   But the parents have a tendency,
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:06.420]   have a way,
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:07.420]   there's a mechanism
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:09.420]   to turn that off
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:11.420]   because they can't survive.
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:12.420]   Because if you have
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:13.420]   even one child
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:14.420]   or maybe you have
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:16.420]   five children or six
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:17.420]   and they all go through
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:18.420]   a stage where they're like
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.420]   "Mommy, Mommy!"
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:22.420]   You know,
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:24.420]   they want your attention constantly.
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:26.420]   You know, I drop my Cheerios.
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.420]   "Mommy, I want a Cheerios."
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:30.420]   You know,
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:32.420]   my brother took the bigger spoon.
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:34.420]   I wanted the bigger spoon.
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:35.420]   You know,
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:36.420]   he took more vanilla.
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:37.420]   I wanted vanilla.
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:38.420]   He took the chocolate.
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:40.420]   "Mommy!"
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:41.420]   So because you hear
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:43.420]   that 24/7,
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:45.420]   you recognize
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:46.420]   what needs your attention
[01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:47.420]   and what doesn't need
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:48.420]   your attention.
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:49.420]   Right?
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.420]   So you have to learn
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:52.420]   to shut that off
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.420]   because you can't be jumping
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:54.420]   every time
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:56.420]   "Mommy!"
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:59.400]   "I want to use that chopstick."
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:01.400]   "He got my chopstick."
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.400]   You just can't turn it off.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.400]   You just go do
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.400]   your business, right?
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.400]   But there's a kind of cry
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.400]   that your child cries
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.400]   that even if it's
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.400]   three in the morning,
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.400]   you know this is not a dribble.
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.400]   This is not casual.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:23.400]   "Mommy!"
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:26.400]   "Daddy!"
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.380]   Even if it's three in the morning.
[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:31.380]   Even if you're sick.
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:33.380]   Even if you didn't sleep at all.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.380]   When you hear that cry,
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.380]   you jump
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:37.380]   and you pay attention
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:38.380]   because you know
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:42.380]   they need you.
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:47.380]   In the way that we live our lives,
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:49.380]   we may be...
[01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:52.380]   we may be...
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:56.380]   "God..."
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:59.380]   "There's a house again there."
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:01.380]   And you say, "Oh, God doesn't answer our prayer."
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:02.380]   Maybe that prayer
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:03.380]   doesn't need to be answered
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:06.380]   because I don't think you really care
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:09.380]   because we haven't decided in our heart.
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:12.380]   We haven't decided to follow Christ.
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:14.380]   We've decided to be in the race.
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:16.380]   We've decided not to be judged.
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:17.380]   But we haven't decided
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:20.380]   to run this race to win.
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:22.380]   That's why if you're an individual
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:26.360]   who's not fighting to finish the race,
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:30.360]   anybody who's a cheerleader is like annoying
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:33.360]   because you're just trying to relax.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.360]   You're just trying to watch a movie
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.360]   and then you hear somebody say,
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:39.360]   "Let's go!"
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.360]   "Let's go one more mile."
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.360]   "You're almost there."
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.360]   "Let's go."
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.360]   "Don't do that."
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.360]   "Don't stop for that."
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.360]   "Put on the right shoes."
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.360]   "Get in the work."
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.360]   And so if you're committed
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:53.360]   to this race, you want a cheerleader.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.360]   You want somebody to pump
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.360]   some energy into you to go.
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.360]   But if that's not you,
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.360]   you're just kind of like casually just like,
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:02.360]   "Come on. Calm down."
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.360]   "Dim the lights a little bit."
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.360]   You know what I mean?
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.360]   Like lower your voice.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.360]   What's so important?
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.360]   Even the way you listen to sermons
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.360]   is different depending on
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:17.360]   which race you're committed to.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.360]   If you're running to win,
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:21.360]   fellowship looks different.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.340]   Your prayer life will look different.
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:27.340]   Your Bible studies will look different.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:30.340]   Your evangelism will look different.
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:31.340]   But first and foremost,
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:34.340]   we have to decide.
[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:36.340]   Which race are we running?
[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:38.340]   Are we in the rat race?
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:39.340]   Are we committed to the race
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:42.340]   that he has set before us?
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:49.340]   Let's pray.
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:50.340]   Again, as our worship team
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.340]   comes to lead us,
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:53.340]   let's take a few minutes
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:56.340]   to examine ourselves.
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:57.340]   Where are we?
[01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:59.340]   Where is our heart?
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:00.340]   Have we drifted
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:01.340]   and we just kind of accepted it?
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:02.340]   Are we fighting?
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:05.340]   Are we wrestling?
[01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:06.340]   God's not calling us to poverty.
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.340]   God's not calling all of us
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:09.340]   into ministry.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:11.340]   But God is calling all of us
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:14.340]   to run this race to win.
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.340]   So let's take some time to pray.
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:17.340]   Again, as our worship team leads us,
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:19.340]   that Lord, if my heart has drifted,
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.340]   Lord, show me, search me,
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:22.340]   and know me,
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:24.340]   see if there's any hurtful ways in me.
[01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:25.340]   Let the Word of God judge
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:26.340]   the thoughts and intentions
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:27.340]   of our heart,
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:29.340]   that we may confess our sins
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:31.340]   and run this race to win.
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:33.340]   Let's pray.

[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:12.320]   and distracted by the temptations of this world.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.320]   I pray that you would keep us from temptation,
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.320]   deliver us from evil,
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:19.320]   that we may come seek you, Lord God, for our daily bread,

[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:25.300]   All right, as we go, I'll get a quick announcement, okay?
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:28.300]   So our sister Susan Fongray
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:32.300]   was able to get parking on that side.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.300]   And the new building and the building behind it,
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:37.300]   I've already made this announcement on Friday,
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:39.300]   but that parking is open.
[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:43.300]   So if you're in the habit of parking way down there,
[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:44.300]   this side is open.
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:46.300]   There's about 60 or 70 spots.
[01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:48.300]   So again, we're going to reserve that side
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:50.300]   for families with small children,
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:52.300]   and then everybody else can park in those area.
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:53.300]   But that side will be open.
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:55.300]   So the way to get there is you kind of have to go
[01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:57.300]   to the back street to get there.
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:59.300]   So starting from next week, you might want to check there.
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:02.300]   And then if it's not open, then you can park down there.
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:03.280]   That area is open.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:06.280]   So if you see Susan, you can thank her, okay?
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:09.280]   So again, if we can have this side go out that side
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:11.280]   and this side enter through this way.
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:13.280]   All right, thank you.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.760]   and then you're done.
