[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:20.200]   - Describe why you decided to start English Corner
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.320]   and how is it building towards the church of Bible?
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.800]   - So we started the English Corner
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.600]   as a means to meet people.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.600]   It's really hard to start a friendship cold,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.960]   just trying to randomly talk to people.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.360]   And so we felt that starting an English Corner
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.400]   would give us a better opportunity
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.560]   to meet people who know English
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.920]   and we're able to build a friendship that way.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.720]   It's through these friendships and relationships
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.640]   where the gospel could be shared.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.540]   And eventually we hope that as time progresses
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.880]   and as more time is invested into the relationship
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.140]   that if they're interested in knowing more
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.440]   about the Bible, knowing more about Jesus Christ,
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.000]   that we would as a team bring them to our Bible study.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.600]   - Can you describe the format of the English Corner?
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.120]   - So we have our MC start off, which is typically me.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.600]   We'll just do introductions,
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.080]   explaining what the English Corner is about.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.360]   And then we follow that with about a 15, 20 minute
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.700]   break, icebreaker.
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.680]   And then we have one of our team members present on a topic.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.640]   We have different topics all set throughout the year
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.200]   and then we rotate between our members.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.000]   And then after that, we have discussion questions.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.480]   - What are the difficulties in building relationships
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.760]   in the city?
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.200]   - Meeting new people is not difficult,
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.420]   but building relationships are,
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.440]   just because when locals meet foreigners,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.600]   they immediately want to improve their English
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.440]   and that's kind of their own primary goal.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.200]   So I found it very difficult not making friends,
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.120]   but building a friendship with Chinese locals.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.120]   - I think definitely finding ways to relate to them
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.840]   because even saying foreigners,
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.400]   sometimes it's easier to get to know them.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.680]   We already have a lot in common in moving
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.720]   to a different country.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.280]   But I mean, even with the locals,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.760]   the ones that are believers,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.760]   I think it's been difficult to remind myself that
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.760]   as long as you have Christ, that should be enough.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.120]   - In order for the work to continue
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.880]   and for the church plant to be established,
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.880]   what specific needs do you have?
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.520]   - I think once this current team leaves,
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.420]   we need a lot of help with English Corner.
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.440]   Since English Corner is the main avenue for outreach,
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.280]   we need people to be plugged in to help lead it.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.640]   I won't be able to just because of the marriage
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.040]   responsibilities I have.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.120]   So that's why we need people to come and to help out
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.880]   with this specific English Corner.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.100]   - Who has the strongest selfie game?
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.940]   - Tony.
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.060]   - Yeah.
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.900]   - What the?
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.020]   - I'll tell you, you're so good at this.
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.580]   [MUSIC]
