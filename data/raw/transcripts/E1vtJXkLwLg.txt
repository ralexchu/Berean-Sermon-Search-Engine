[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Welcome to Marine Community Church.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.000]   We have a bunch of announcements to get to,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   so let me get started with this.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   First of all, I told you guys that
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   the shuttling system is going to get started soon.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   The official date that they've assigned for that
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   is June 25th, so starting from not next Sunday,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   but Sunday after that, you'll see shuttles
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   that are going to be going around in certain parking lots,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   especially the one that's far lot,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   not the ones on Mitchell,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   but if you go down, I think it's Cowan,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   and at the end of that, there's a parking lot
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.500]   that has about 150 spaces there,
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.500]   so there's going to be shuttles that's going to be going around,
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.500]   and so we're trying to create a habit of people parking there,
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.500]   and then the shuttle system's going,
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.500]   so again, the specific hours of those shuttles that are going,
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.500]   we'll let you know more specifically in the next week
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.500]   before that gets started,
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.500]   so just kind of give you a heads up.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.500]   So right now, you might see a shuttle,
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.500]   but it's not an official thing yet.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.500]   They're just kind of testing things out
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.500]   to see what route needs to go,
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.500]   so not next Sunday, but Sunday after that,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.500]   India's pastor support.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.500]   We're starting again a new year.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.500]   If you committed previous year,
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.500]   we're asking that if you can commit again another year
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.500]   from June to June next year,
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.500]   and the funds that are going to,
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.500]   $50 a month that will go to the families
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.500]   to support the pastors to do their ministry,
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.500]   and if you would just prefer to give a $600 for the whole year,
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.500]   again, that will help the ministry
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.500]   that's going on over there,
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.500]   so if you want to sign up for that,
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.500]   there's Facebook, the app,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.500]   they'll have places where you can sign up for that.
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:46.500]   Child safety training,
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.500]   that was supposed to be scheduled today
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.500]   because the people who are running that got sick,
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.500]   so they're not here,
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.500]   so they're postponing that until July 9th at 1 p.m.,
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.500]   so if you were scheduled to go to that today,
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.500]   they're postponing that until July 9th, okay?
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.500]   And again, a heads up, next week is Father's Day,
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.500]   and there's going to be a lemonade stand,
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.000]   cookies and beef jerky and that kind of stuff
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   that's for the fathers who are coming,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   so make sure you stop by those booths after service,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   and this is being run by our children,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   and so they're going to be there serving, okay?
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   So that's next Sunday,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   and then the next round of Berean membership class
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   is happening on July 9th,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   so if you want to become a member of the church,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   that's starting on July 9th from 9 to 10.20 a.m., okay?
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   And then Jubilee Fellowship,
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.000]   so if you are 50 and over,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   the next Jubilee Fellowship is happening on June 25th at 1 p.m.,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   and so if you want to sign up for that,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   the lunch cost is $12,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   and then our Elder Phillip is going to be in charge of that,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   so please sign up with him.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Again, all of this is on the website and the church app,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   so you can go and sign up for that.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   And then one last announcement,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   today we have a garage trunk sale
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   that's happening at 1.30 p.m.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.000]   where families are donating their goods,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   and so the money raised for that is going to be for donation
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   for the Baby Box Ministry that's happening out in Korea.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   So as you guys know, as our team goes out,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   not this week, but next week,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   we're going to be visiting and doing some work with them,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   and so the money that's raised today with that
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   is going to be donated to that.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   So that's happening at 1.30 at the church parking lot,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   so if you're around or if you ate
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   and you want to come back and see what they have,
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.000]   that's going to be spread out and ready at 1.30.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Well, this morning we have Baby...
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Wait, do we do it now or later?
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Oh, we do it now? Okay, I forgot.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   We don't do it before my sermon?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Huh?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Okay, we do it now?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Oh, okay. All right, so we're doing it now.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   All right, so we have Baby introduction today,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   so if we can have all the parents come up to the front.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.500]   Okay.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.500]   Yeah, so our...
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.500]   Our church is being very fruitful and multiplying,
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.500]   so we are very concerned about our facilities.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.500]   (laughter)
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   So we're very concerned about our facilities.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.500]   (laughter)
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.500]   So we are very concerned about our facilities.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.500]   (laughter)
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.500]   Okay. All right.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.500]   So I'm going to give the mic to Herman first.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.500]   (baby crying)
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.500]   Okay, so the fathers will introduce the children
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.500]   to us going down the line, okay?
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.500]   Hi, good morning.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.500]   My name is Herman and this is Jennifer,
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.500]   and our daughter is Gabriela.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.000]   We chose the name Gabriela
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   because we just liked the way it sounded,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   but it does mean God is my strength.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Our prayer request is for Gabby to grow up
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   in the knowledge of who God is
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   and to develop a genuine saving faith in Christ
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   as her Lord and Savior.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   As her parents, we pray for godly wisdom
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   and guidance in raising both of our girls
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.500]   to be good and good parents.
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.500]   (applause)
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:33.500]   Hi, everyone. My name is Tim.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.500]   This is my wife, Patticus,
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.500]   and this is little Jasmine, Ember.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.500]   She's six weeks old.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.500]   She's got four other siblings,
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.500]   and she desperately wants her diaper to be changed.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.500]   (laughter)
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.500]   She's got minor health problems,
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.500]   but it's just a joy.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.500]   The brothers and sisters,
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.500]   they just love on her.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.500]   It's just a wonderful time.
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.500]   Our prayer for her, just like the rest of her kids,
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.500]   is that the Lord will save them.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.500]   One of our kids is saved, we think,
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.500]   but the rest of them, they don't.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.500]   We pray for the rest of the kids
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.500]   at this church that the Lord saves them.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.500]   Thank you.
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.500]   (applause)
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.500]   Hello. My name is Isaac.
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.500]   This is my wife, Elise, and this is our son, Nehemiah.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.500]   He's three months old, our first child.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.500]   Oh, yeah, very cute.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.500]   His name's Nehemiah.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.500]   I think it means "comforted by God,"
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.500]   but don't quote me on that.
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.000]   Our prayer would be that he grows up
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   to be a good man who loves the Lord
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   and pray for me and Elise to be good parents.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   We often tell each other we don't know what we're doing,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   so we just want to do our best.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   (applause)
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Hi, I'm Henry.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   This is my wife, Liz, our daughter, Reagan.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   It's good to be back with you guys.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   We actually had her when we were up north at BMC,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.500]   and we had a lot of different invitations there,
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.500]   so we were waiting to come here.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.500]   Which is why she's a little old.
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.500]   Her name is Reagan, which we just liked how that sounded.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.500]   It actually means, I think in some language,
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.500]   "little ruler," and unfortunately that came true
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.500]   in our house where she's ruling over especially me.
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.500]   Alinea means "a new line of thought" in Latin,
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.500]   and we liked how that was sounding too.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.000]   Her Chinese name is actually, it means "grace and wisdom."
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   And the second character there is actually
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   the second character of Liz's Chinese name as well,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   so it was a little bit of carrying through.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Our prayer for her is that she would live a life
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   that is glorifying God, and that she may enjoy God eternally.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   And along with that, our prayer for you guys to help us with
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:20.000]   is that the decisions we make on a day-to-day basis
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   to raise her, disciple her, discipline her
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   would be towards that end and not the ends of this world.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Hello, I'm Dave. This is my wife Esther.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   This is Logan. He will be three next month.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   And this is Levi, and he will be two months next month.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.500]   God has already kind of answered every prayer
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.500]   that we could possibly give him,
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.500]   so we just pray that both of them would know him
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.500]   and chase after God with everything they have
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.500]   and work for his kingdom by helping others do the same.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.500]   So, yeah.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:13.500]   Hi everyone. I'm Jensen. My wife is Sharon.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.500]   And this is Ellis and Andy.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.500]   I wish we had a story to tell about their names,
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.500]   but we just liked how they sounded.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.500]   I think our prayer for our kids are that they would understand
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.500]   the weight and depravity of their sin,
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.500]   and they would see their need of Jesus at an early age.
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.500]   And she wants to say that.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.500]   But yeah, if you could join us in prayer with that,
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.500]   we'd appreciate it. Thank you.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.000]   (applause)
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Hi, my name is Sam. My wife here is Grace.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   This is Abby, or Abigail. She's two and a half.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   And this is Eli. He's about nine months.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Elias, he's about nine months.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Our prayer for them is that they would just know Jesus
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   and just serve him over everything else.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Oh, and their names. So, Abigail means "father's joy,"
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   and I really wanted a daughter, so I was really happy
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.000]   when I found out. And then Elias means "the Lord is my God,"
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   so we just really wanted that to be a foundation for him.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   (applause)
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Hey, everyone. My name is John. This is my wife, Jess.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And this is our youngest, Calvin.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Oldest is Christopher. Middle is Charlie. Last is Calvin.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   With Calvin, we kind of backed ourselves into a corner
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.000]   and, you know, it has to be a seed name, so we just picked Calvin
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   because it sounded the coolest.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   In addition to everybody else's prayer requests
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   and for the salvation of all three of our kids,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   if you just pray for us as parents.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Every time we have a kid, the dynamic seems to change.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   We're dealing now with a middle child where I've never really
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   had to deal with one, and so you guys just pray for that.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Thank you.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   (applause)
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.500]   All right, so before we send them off, I want to pray for them.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.500]   But again, part of the reason why we introduced the babies
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.500]   to the church is that we are aware of the next generation
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.500]   of people who are in our church, especially now.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.500]   I'm sure you guys are aware, especially in California.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.500]   What they are--the public schools are, like, committed
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.500]   to indoctrinate our kids against the teachings of the Scripture
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.500]   where it's no longer neutral.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.500]   It's a hostile environment that these children are being raised in.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.500]   So it's always been important that the parents are actively involved
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.500]   in praying, but all the more today, the parents really have
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.500]   to be committed to make sure that the fight--
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.500]   good fight is being fought at home, especially with the children,
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.500]   with what's going on.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.500]   And so we want to make sure--or at least do our best for our next generation
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.500]   of children. They have a community in the church that's starting
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.500]   from a young age where the teaching and the culture
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.500]   and the values of what they're being raised in the community,
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.500]   that they would be strengthened so that when they're going out
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.500]   and really, like, standing against the tide in the culture,
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   that they would be able to do that together.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.500]   So my prayer--our prayer is that all of us as a church,
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.500]   whether you have children or don't have children or maybe your children
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.500]   are older, you're not at that stage anymore, but to really be prayerful
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.500]   about the next generation, not just for ours, but that what we are learning
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.500]   and growing and building is going to affect the next generation
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.500]   of children as well, okay?
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.000]   So let me pray for us, and then I'll also pray for the offering,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   and then we'll let them go, and then we'll enter into our main time of worship.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Let's pray.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much for blessing each one
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   of these families, Lord God, with the precious gift of life.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Lord, as every single one of them has expressed desire, Lord,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   that their children would come to faith early,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   we ask, Lord God, that you would give them the strength to be a model,
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.000]   that you would use the father and mother to be the first missionaries
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   to these children, to share the gospel with them,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   that they would be raised in a home that is not simply nominal,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   going to church, Lord God, but that they would be an example
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   of what it means to be a genuine follower of Christ,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   so that the preaching of the word and the life of the parents
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   would be consistent. So we pray, Father God, as our church commits, Lord,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   not just for us, but for the next generation of children,
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.000]   help us, Lord, to build a community that is strong,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   based on your word, to follow in your spirit,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   that we would truly be the light and that they would be the light
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   in this dark world. So we pray for your grace, we pray for strength,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   we pray for our teachers in our church, Lord God, who are volunteering
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   to care for them, that it would not simply be a responsibility,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   a task that they do each Sunday, but give them a greater vision, Lord God,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   to bring the gospel even to these children, that again,
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.000]   that they would come to faith early and for many, many years,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   as you have ordained for them to walk on this earth,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   that they would be the light. And so we pray for your grace,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   we pray that even in this offering that we give now,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   may it be filled with your blessing, may it be multiplied 30, 60,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   100 fold for the sake of your kingdom. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Alright, let's give them a hand as they go back to their seats.

[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   We'll be again reading from verse 12 through 16.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Luke chapter six, verses 12 through 16.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   It was at this time that he went off to the mountain to pray
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   and he spent the whole night in prayer to God.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And when they came, he called his disciples to him
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   and chose 12 of them whom he also named as apostles.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.000]   12 in whom he also named Peter and Andrew, his brother,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   and James and John and Philip and Bartholomew
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   and Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Simon who was called the zealot, Judas the son of James,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   and Judas Iscariot who became a traitor.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Let's pray.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   We pray for your word that it would bear fruit in our hearts.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   May your word and your word only go forth.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.500]   I forgot to announce, starting from today,
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.500]   the college students have their study hall
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.500]   from 6 to 2, Monday, Tuesday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.500]   And so just like we do every time we do that,
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.500]   if you are interested or want to help out and bring snacks,
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.500]   you can just drop it off at the cafe when you come.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.500]   So whether it's today, Monday, or Tuesday,
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   again, just to encourage them so that they can actually study.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.500]   So you can just take it and drop it off at the cafe.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.500]   All right, this morning we're going to be spending some time
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   talking about Andrew.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.500]   And there's not a lot of material on him,
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:13.500]   but there's a reason why I wanted to take some time to talk about him.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.500]   How many of you in this room are middle children?
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.500]   Okay, some of you guys are reluctant to say.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.500]   Okay, so middle children, yes.
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.500]   Middle children have a reputation of being difficult, strong-headed,
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.500]   you know, growing up thinking like life is not fair.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.500]   Maybe some of you don't feel that way, but that's a typical, right?
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.500]   If you say middle children, that's kind of like, oh, you know,
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.500]   these are the typical things that we would expect of a middle child.
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.500]   And I can say that I'm probably the most prototypical middle child.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.500]   The three boys growing up thinking that life is not fair, nobody cares, you know.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.500]   And then if I get in a fight with my older brother, I get in trouble.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.500]   It's like, why are you fighting with your older brother?
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.500]   If I fight with my younger brother, why are you fighting with your younger brother?
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.500]   So, again, whether that's true or not, like growing up thinking that,
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.500]   it's like, oh, life is not fair, I'm like, does anybody care?
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:10.500]   Right? And that's, again, maybe you didn't grow up that way,
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.500]   but until I became a Christian, that was like dominant thought in my head.
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.500]   And it affected everything that I did, just being angry about everything,
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.500]   and just life is not fair.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.500]   How many of you guys know Brady Bunch?
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.500]   Okay, some of you guys know, okay.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.500]   It's a program that some of us grew up watching back in the '70s and '80s.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:36.500]   And so there's a character in that TV show named Janet.
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.500]   Huh?
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.500]   Jan, okay, so she knows.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.500]   (Laughter)
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.500]   Oh, it wasn't Janet, Jan.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.500]   Okay, Jan, and so there's a thing, a statement that she would always say.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.500]   She's like, "Marsha, Marsha, Marsha."
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.500]   Because she's always complaining that Marsha gets all the attention.
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.500]   She's the pretty sister, the older sister, and she always gets jipped.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.500]   And that's the prototypical middle child syndrome,
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.500]   that you're always left out, nobody cares, you're not seen, you're not important.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:08.500]   Now, I say all of this because Andrew is the saint of middle children, right?
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.500]   That's just a joke.
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.500]   Don't go out and say, "Oh, yeah, I didn't know that."
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:18.500]   Andrew is the neglected disciple that we don't know much about.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.500]   In fact, when we dig a little bit further,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.500]   it's actually even more surprising that there's not much mentioned about him.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:32.500]   In the Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary, when you look up Andrew, this is what it says.
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:36.500]   The New Testament shows little interest in Andrew.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:40.500]   That's what it says in the Bible Dictionary.
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.500]   There's little interest in Andrew.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.500]   There's not a lot written about him.
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:49.500]   But he's the one, he's the first of the disciples.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.500]   Before he, Jesus knew anyway, Andrew was the one who was pointed to Christ,
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.500]   and then he goes over there and he gets his older brother, or younger brother,
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.500]   we're not exactly sure if he's older or younger,
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.500]   and takes Peter and introduces him.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:11.500]   In fact, most likely, Andrew was the first one that brought Peter and James and John to Jesus.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:16.500]   Andrew is known, again, not by many texts, but what little that we do know about Andrew,
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.500]   Andrew was a missionary.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.500]   He was the one who brought people to Christ.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.500]   He was the one who introduced him.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.500]   And then after he's introduced, there's not much spoken about him.
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.500]   He just disappeared.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:32.500]   He brings people, like the boy who had the loaves and the fish, Andrew was the one who brought him.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.500]   There's a Greek who wanted to know more about Christ,
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.500]   and Andrew was the one who brought him to Jesus.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:42.500]   And so he's known to be the middleman who connects people to Jesus,
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.500]   and then that's it, and he just disappears.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.500]   So, the more, the little information that we do have,
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.500]   you would automatically think, like, he, being the first disciple,
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.500]   the one who introduced other disciples to him,
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.500]   why was he not more prominent?
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:03.500]   There's three things that I want to cover in this morning,
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.500]   and hopefully you'll understand why, at the end of this,
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:11.500]   why I wanted to take some time to consider why this was so important.
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:16.500]   Andrew, first of all, was the disciple of John the Baptist.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.000]   And I'm just going to read this text to you so that you kind of,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   because there's not a whole lot written about Andrew,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   but I want to introduce him to you by reading this text,
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   and this is how Andrew shows up at this scene in the Gospels.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   In John chapter 1, 35-41,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   "Again the next day, John was standing," this is John the Baptist,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   "was standing with two of his disciples, and he looked at Jesus as he walked and said,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   'Behold the Lamb of God!'
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus."
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Now, these two disciples, one of them is going to be clearly identified, Andrew,
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.500]   some think that maybe that was John, but we don't know that for sure because he's not identified.
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:54.500]   But we know for sure that it was Andrew because later on it says so.
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.500]   "And Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, 'What do you seek?'
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.500]   They said to him, 'Rabbi,'" which translated means teacher,
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:04.500]   "'where are you staying?' He said to them, 'Come and you will see.'
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.500]   So they came and saw where he was staying,
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:10.500]   and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:15.500]   One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon the Baptist."
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.000]   Simon, Peter's brother.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   "He found first his own brother Simon and said to him,
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   'We have found the Messiah,'" which translated means Christ.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Now, you would think with a beginning like that, Andrew being the first disciple,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   being the disciple of John the Baptist, that he would have a more prominent role.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   In fact, after this happens, you know very little about Andrew
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   other than the fact that he's introducing people to Christ.
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:49.000]   John, some people think that maybe James and John were also disciples of John the Baptist,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   but again, that's a minority view.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   We don't know for sure if John was the other person, again, but the Bible never says that.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   But what we do know for a fact is Andrew clearly is identified
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   as the one who followed John the Baptist first.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   And he was the first one who recognizes the Messiah,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   and he brings his brother, and most likely the other two as well.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.500]   Now, you have to understand, what does it mean for him to be a disciple of John the Baptist?
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:21.500]   Which means that John started his discipleship before he met Christ.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:27.500]   All the other disciples began this journey with Christ when they met Jesus.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:32.500]   John the Baptist, his whole ministry was to prepare for Christ.
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:36.500]   So, we don't know how long he was a disciple of John the Baptist,
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.500]   but what we do know is he had training before.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.500]   His whole training was to prepare him for them to meet Jesus.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:50.500]   That's why when Jesus shows up, he said, "He's the one, he's the Messiah," he just leaves and goes.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:55.500]   There's no struggling, there's no talk about, like, "Oh, how can I abandon you to go follow him?"
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.500]   Because John the Baptist prepared him for that.
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:03.500]   So, his whole ministry was to get him ready.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:07.500]   Now, you have to understand, at that particular time, to be a disciple,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.500]   discipleship didn't happen in classrooms.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.500]   Like, "Oh, we're going to have discipleship programs, we're going to go here, we're going to read this,
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.500]   and we're going to give you an assignment and come back and then check up on you."
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.500]   That's not how discipleship happened.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:22.500]   Discipleship happened in that period where if someone was being discipled,
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.500]   you would leave your home and you would live with that person.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.500]   You would eat with them, travel with them, and whatever happened,
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.500]   whatever they ate, you would eat.
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.500]   However they dressed, whatever honor or dishonor they got, you would be a part of that.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.500]   Just like the disciples left everything to follow Jesus,
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.500]   John the Baptist's disciples probably did the same thing.
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:47.500]   They left everything to follow him, so Andrew was already committed.
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:50.500]   He didn't leave everything when Jesus showed up.
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:54.500]   He already left everything to be a disciple of John the Baptist.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.500]   John, as you guys know, lived in the wilderness.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.500]   He didn't live in a comfortable home.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:03.500]   He was a reflection of the Old Testament prophets, especially Elijah.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.500]   Even the way he dressed, as sackcloth and camel's hair with leather belt.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:16.500]   And he came, and if you know anything about the Old Testament prophets, they suffered.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.500]   God made them do strange things, even be homeless for large periods of time,
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:24.500]   just so that they can convey the message with their life.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:28.500]   And so John the Baptist was a man who lived a difficult life.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.500]   His whole diet was honey and locusts, living out in the wilderness.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.500]   And even his message.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:42.500]   You know, if you ever see a depiction of Jesus, you'll see him on the cross,
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.500]   or you'll see him with his hands stretched out with a halo on the head.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:50.500]   Probably one of the most affectionate pictures of Jesus is he's sitting,
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:54.500]   and you have children around him, and Jesus is laughing and he's very welcoming.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.500]   Depending on what picture you see.
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.500]   But have you ever seen John the Baptist's picture?
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.500]   Obviously it's not a picture, it's a depiction.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.500]   What they imagined John the Baptist would be.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.500]   He's always angry in this picture.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.500]   And often times he's black and white.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.500]   He's very serious.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.500]   He has a very serious message.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.500]   Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:21.500]   He's always clothed in almost homeless-like clothing.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.500]   And so the fact that Andrew followed him,
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.500]   that Andrew was prepared for whatever difficulty that was going to come,
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:35.500]   Andrew was the one who was the most prepared to be the disciple of Christ.
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:39.500]   So the fact that he was the first, the fact that he was trained,
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.500]   and the fact that he is the one who first brings everybody to him,
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:45.500]   you would automatically think, right?
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.500]   John the Baptist would be the... Andrew would be the leader.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:50.500]   Not Peter.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.500]   Andrew would be a significant person.
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:56.500]   At the minimum he would be at the core.
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.500]   But he just does his job and it almost disappears.
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.500]   We don't know much about him.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:09.500]   So why was Andrew not more significant?
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:14.500]   Andrew is known more for what is not recorded about him.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.500]   So everything that I deduce about his character
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.500]   and who he is in his ministry comes from what's not here.
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:24.000]   What is here I just already told you.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Everything significant that we know about Andrew,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   I've already kind of shared with you.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   Why was he not in the core?
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   I remember when... because I have four children
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   and I have two children in the middle,
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   and I remember Zachary when he was a little kid.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   Zachary is kind of kind-hearted. He doesn't like to be mean.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   And so when he would get angry at his brother,
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.000]   older brother, and this is before Isaiah came into the world,
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   and the way he would convey discontent with his brother,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   he would say, "I like mommy, I like daddy, I like faith."
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   And then he would pause and say, "That's it."
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   [laughter]
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   That's how he would convey discontent.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   That's him saying, "Jeremy hurt me."
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   He's like, "I like mommy, I like daddy, I like faith, and that's it."
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   So we knew exactly what he was saying.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.500]   By the absence of Jeremy's name on that list,
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.500]   he was not happy with him.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:27.500]   So every time I look at the list of the inner core,
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:32.500]   it's kind of like, Jesus chose Peter, James, and John,
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.500]   and that's it.
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:37.500]   Why is he not here?
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:40.500]   Andrew's name actually is only mentioned
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.500]   12 times in the New Testament.
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:47.500]   And in the 12 times, the 4 times is just on the list of disciples.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.500]   He's just one of the 12 that is mentioned.
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:54.500]   And of the 8, majority of it is just insignificant,
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:58.500]   it's just passing. Andrew happened to be there. Andrew was also there.
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:02.500]   But everything that we know significant about Andrew,
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.500]   I already told you. That's it.
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.500]   Why was he not at the core?
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:14.500]   In fact, in John 1, 41-42, after Andrew introduces Simon to Jesus,
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.500]   this is what happens.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.500]   "And Andrew introduced his own brother Simon and said to him,
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.500]   'We have found the Messiah,'" which translated means Christ,
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.500]   "He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said,
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.500]   'You are Simon, son of John; you shall be called Cephas,'"
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.500]   which translated Peter.
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.500]   Andrew introduced Simon to Jesus,
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:37.500]   and the first thing that Jesus says is like, "Simon, you know,
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.500]   Simon, you're going to be my disciple."
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.500]   He just completely bypasses Andrew and says,
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.500]   "Simon, I'm going to change your name.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.500]   I'm going to be your leader." From the get-go.
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:52.500]   There's no record of anything Andrew has done or said that was wrong.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:56.500]   Outside of he was one of the people who scattered when Jesus went to the cross,
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.500]   but there's no record that he did something, he said something.
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.500]   He must have done something that disqualified him,
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.500]   but there's no record of that.
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.500]   Any mention of Andrew is positive.
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.500]   So again, why was he not at the core?
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.500]   In Mark chapter 5, verse 37, when a synagogue official's daughter dies,
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:21.500]   Jesus is going to go heal, and he didn't want this to spread,
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.500]   so this is what he did.
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:26.500]   And he allowed no one to accompany him except Peter, James, and John.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.500]   And that's it.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.500]   I added that that's it.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.500]   Where's Andrew?
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.500]   At the transfiguration, Matthew 17, verse 1.
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:39.500]   This is the most important thing that he's going to reveal to them,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.500]   because they're going to go and tell that this is who Jesus is.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.500]   They're going to hear the voice of God, and it says this,
[00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:49.500]   "Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, his brother,
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:52.500]   and led them up on a high mountain by themselves."
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:55.500]   And that's it. Where's Andrew?
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:58.500]   He's the first. He was the disciple of John the Baptist.
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:02.500]   He would have been the most qualified, but he's not in the middle.
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:06.500]   Mark chapter 14, 32-33, at the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.500]   it says, "They came to a place and named Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples,
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.500]   'Sit here until I have prayed.'
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:19.500]   And he took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be very distressed and troubled."
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:23.500]   Peter, James, and John, repeatedly over and over again.
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:28.500]   You can't miss it. Why is Andrew not there?
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.500]   Considering what we know about him.
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:34.500]   In fact, it doesn't stop with Jesus' ministry.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.500]   We get into the New Testament, and Apostle Paul goes to Jerusalem
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.500]   to try to connect with the leaders.
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:45.500]   He says this, Galatians 2-9, "And recognizing the grace that had been given to me,
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:49.500]   James, and Cephas, and John, James, Peter, and John,
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:54.500]   who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:59.500]   so that we might go to Gentiles, and they to the circumcised."
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.500]   Where is Andrew?
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.500]   In fact, the last time we hear of Andrew is in Acts 1,
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:10.500]   where there's a list of the 11 disciples, and Andrew's name happened to be there.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.500]   And after that, we never hear of Andrew again.
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:17.500]   There's no record of his preaching, there's no record of church planting,
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:22.500]   there's no record of who he discipled, there's no record of anything that he said.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:25.500]   Outside of what I mentioned to you, that is it.
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.500]   So the question is, why?
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.500]   Why is Andrew not here?
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.000]   Even though it may be something, it's like, oh, it's a mystery,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   you know, maybe we'll know when we get in heaven.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   But I'll bet you, all of you have the same reaction that I do.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   Maybe varying degrees of that, right?
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   Why is he not there?
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   I wonder if there's anybody in this room maybe asking the question,
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   "Who cares? Why is this such a big deal? So he's not there, so what?"
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   Maybe some of you are thinking that.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   My guess is most of you, just varying degrees, are asking the same question.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.500]   Right?
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:07.500]   What did Andrew do? Why didn't he get the honor to be in the inner core?
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:13.500]   Maybe, maybe they just needed three.
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:17.500]   And they had four, they had two brothers, and they just had to choose one,
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:22.500]   and maybe Andrew just, you know, maybe he volunteered, okay, take me out, I don't know.
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.500]   It doesn't say.
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.500]   Maybe Andrew just wasn't a natural leader.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.500]   You have two sons of thunder, so you know that these guys are go-getters, right?
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:35.500]   Like, wanted to kill people, and then they want to love people, and so they were go-getters.
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.500]   Peter was a go-getter.
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:39.500]   Maybe Andrew was just kind of in the background, maybe he's an introvert.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:42.500]   I don't know. It doesn't say.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:49.500]   But I think it's important for us to question not why is Andrew not there,
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:53.500]   but why does it bother us that he's not there?
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.500]   Why does it bother?
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.500]   Why do we look at that and say something must have gone wrong,
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.500]   because he should have been in that position of honor?
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:11.500]   Martin Luther King, Jr., who was assassinated in 1968 in April.
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:17.500]   Two months before his assassination, this is the second of the last sermon that he gives,
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:23.500]   and in this sermon, the title is called "Drum Major's Instinct."
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.500]   "Drum Major's Instinct," and this is what he says in this sermon.
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:32.500]   "We all want to be important to surpass others, to achieve distinction, to lead the parade.
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:38.500]   Alfred Adler, the great psychoanalyst, contends that this is the dominant impulse.
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:42.500]   Sigmund Freud used to contend that sex was the dominant impulse,
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:46.500]   and Adler came with a new argument saying that this quest for recognition,
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:51.500]   this desire for attention, this desire for distinction is the basic impulse,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.500]   the basic drive of human life, this drum major's instinct."
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:56:02.500]   And he goes on to say that this desire to be recognized, to be distinguished,
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:07.500]   is what was leading to this racial division in the country.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:13.500]   And then he goes on further in saying the reason behind the war is this drum major's instinct.
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:19.500]   The reason behind our marital problems, the reason behind our family problems,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.500]   all at the core of it is a drum major's instinct.
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:29.500]   This drum major's instinct basically, in summary, is basically wanting to get ahead,
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:32.500]   wanting to be better, wanting to be noticed.
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:40.500]   Even though the teaching of Christ repeatedly over and over and over,
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:48.500]   and the example that Jesus gives is to overthrow the paradigm in this world to be better.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.500]   And from the moment that we are born, what kind of child is he going to be?
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:58.500]   In the Korean community, you have this "donjabi" thing, and then you choose, right?
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:04.500]   You're going to be a doctor, you're going to be a businessman, you're going to be a pastor, right?
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:10.500]   But most of those careers are things that we consider to be honorable.
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.500]   You don't put a trash can out there, right?
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:16.500]   "Oh, he's going to become this person, or a blue collar worker."
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.500]   We put that out there. We put that out there because we want to see, oh, what potential?
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:26.500]   Because now they're brand new, so what potential of honor are they going to choose?
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:30.500]   And from the moment that they're born, we're training them.
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:34.500]   We don't want them to get behind. Other kids are learning piano, other kids are playing sports.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:40.500]   We don't want them to get behind, so we want to train them so that they can compete, so that they can be better.
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:45.500]   We want to make sure that they're speaking when they're supposed to speak,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.500]   socializing when they're supposed to socialize.
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:53.500]   And just subconsciously, we start talking, "Oh, when did your kid start walking?"
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.500]   "Oh, my kid walked at one year, two years."
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.500]   "Oh, my kid could put sentence together at one and a half."
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.500]   "Oh, they started reading when they were two."
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.500]   "Oh, my kid's an honor student."
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:10.500]   And so subconsciously, we're feeding that drum major's instinct.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.500]   Things that we had, and we projected on our children.
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:16.500]   What school did they go to? What was their major?
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.500]   What kind of job did they have?
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.500]   Who did they marry? Where are they living?
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.500]   Oh, what kind of retirement?
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.500]   Oh, how's your grandchildren?
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:27.500]   And so this drum major's instinct is so deeply embedded in us.
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:34.500]   Even though we know passage after passage after passage after passage,
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:40.500]   Jesus says over and over and over again, "He who is first shall be last."
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:43.000]   The very last thing that Jesus told his disciples,
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   he got on his feet, humiliated himself, and washed their feet, and said,
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   "If you want to be great in God's kingdom, you must be like this."
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   We learn it, we teach it, we memorize it,
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   and then we shun it in the way that we live.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   The way that we talk.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   What makes us happy and not happy?
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   It's this drum major's instinct.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   Matthew 23, 6-12, or 11-12, "But the greatest among you shall be your servant."
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.500]   "Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted."
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:19.500]   Matthew 18, 1-4, at the time the disciples came to Jesus and said,
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:22.500]   "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.500]   And he called the child to himself and said to him before them, and said,
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.500]   "Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children."
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.500]   Converted. Converted from what?
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:34.500]   Converted from a drum major's instinct.
[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:39.500]   From this pride and wanting to get ahead, to compete, to compare, and to collect.
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:45.000]   This desire to make sure that I'm a little bit better, I'm acknowledged,
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   that we're going to do these things. If I invest my 20's, I'll be honored in my 30's.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   If I invest my 30's, I'll be honored in my 40's.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   If I work hard enough, in my 50's.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   So what does he mean by converted?
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   To convert from that way of thinking and take on the form of a child who has no honor.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   He has no glory, he's just a child.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   That's what he's saying.
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.000]   He's not being saying, "Be naive."
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   Or, "Not intelligent." He's talking about children who have no honor.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   Unless he is converted to be like a child, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   Whoever humbles himself as a child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   It goes opposite of everything that we do since we're born.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   Every impulse that we have to get ahead.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   Even for our own children.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:41.000]   We're fighting against what God is trying to do with us.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   Matthew 20, 27, 28, "And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave."
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   We're following a Christ who constantly teaches us to humble himself, to empty yourself,
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   to become nothing, to be a servant, pick up your own cross, deny your own life, and follow me.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:08.000]   We sing this, we praise this, we memorize this.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   And then yet, our pattern of life goes exactly against it.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   So the question that we have to wrestle with is not, "Why did Andrew not get the distinction?"
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   But the question we have to ask is, "Why does that bother me?"
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:33.000]   Why do we look at that and say, "Something has gone wrong because Andrew is not part of the three."
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   What is happening inside of me?
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   And the reason why so many people in our generation, the feminists, have taken over and saying
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   that it's not fair that women are not able to have positions of honor in the church.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   Because in their mind, the secular worldview has penetrated into their thought,
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:02:01.000]   thinking because if men are leading, then the woman is not as valued.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   The only way that they can be valued is if they're in the front and they're leading.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   But that is not the teaching of Christ.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   The teaching of Christ is the one who serves, the one who is humble,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   the one who is serving is the one who is greatest in the kingdom of God.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   So the fact that it bothers people is not kingdom value.
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:27.000]   It's the world's value that causes them to reject or receive certain things in the scripture.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   In fact, in our church, we try not to use the word "leader"
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   because we don't want to implant in people's heads that the goal of discipleship is to make you a leader.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   And then you begin to compete and compare, "I did this," and train for you to be a leader,
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:54.000]   to rise, to be the cream of the crop, so that you can have positions of honor.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   And we're deliberately trying not to use those terms because our goal is to become more like Christ.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   So that if anything, as you mature and be sanctified, you become better servants.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   To be up in the front and to be recognized is not that hard.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   As much as everybody, whether it's at work or anywhere else, like if you work hard enough,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.500]   you're going to be at the top. It's not that hard.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:26.500]   What I'm doing, I can do while I'm in sin.
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:33.500]   If you're articulate and you went to school and you have certain gifts, you can be in the front.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:38.500]   In fact, people will put you in the front. People will ask you to be in the front.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:44.500]   So it is not difficult if you have certain things that you're good at.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:54.500]   But to be in the background and serving faithfully without recognition, it challenges the core of who we are.
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:04:05.500]   And to do it consistently for a long period of time without honor requires buffeting of our pride, humility, requires character.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:11.500]   To be up in the front, if you've done it for a while, you have education, you have certain gifting,
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.500]   you're able to do this and you happen to be a good salesman.
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:22.500]   A good salesman who's articulate, who has a seminary degree and who likes to read can do what I'm doing.
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:29.500]   It can be copied. In fact, in seminary it was a common thing to say good preachers are a dime a dozen.
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.500]   And I remember that's very humbling as a preacher.
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:36.500]   It's like good preachers are a dime a dozen. Everybody's trying to be a good preacher and they say it's a dime a dozen.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:41.500]   And I can tell you from experience, it's absolutely right.
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:48.000]   Just some people may be just better storytelling. Some people may be better articulate or more compassionate or more knowledgeable.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   Whatever that may be, good preachers are a dime a dozen.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   When I go to conferences, again, because I'm a preacher myself,
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   the people that I get the most blessed by are not the ones up in the front giving instructions and teaching.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   Because I'm a preacher. I know it doesn't require character to do this.
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:18.000]   Even though God requires it, but humanly speaking, there's plenty of people who lie in beds of money,
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   who are adulterous, struggling with impurity, all kinds of sin, and they are great at reading and leading and teaching.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   In fact, the better you are at it, the more benefits you have.
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:41.000]   You write books, you get more money, you travel, people treat you like a celebrity,
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   they come get your signature, your church is growing, everybody wants to model after you,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   and they treat you with honor wherever you go.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   And then you get paid for it, you get financially compensated for that because you're so good at it.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   But to be a faithful servant in the background without honor requires humility.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:07.000]   To be able to serve others without recognition requires a bearing of your own cross.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   It requires love that the world does not understand. It requires a peace that the world cannot give.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   To be faithful and serving Christ for a long period of time without grumbling requires a much higher calling.
[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:31.000]   When measured by the standard of this world, Andrew was gypped.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   Why didn't he get that position? He never got to write scripture. We don't know much about him.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   By the standard of the drum major's instinct, he never got to strike the drum even once.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:53.000]   But Andrew is the perfect example of a man that Christ called us to be.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   He did his job and then just went home. The end.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   God didn't call us to leave a legacy because Christ already left a legacy.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   God didn't call us so that we can have distinction because Christ already left a distinction.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:20.000]   So the calling that he's given us is to point to Christ, introduce people to Christ, and then to go home.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   We may look at that and say, "Well, how come he never got honored?" Again, that's the world's perspective.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   Can any one of us say that Andrew got gypped when he was at home with his Heavenly Father?
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:43.000]   He never promised glory here. He never promised honor here. In fact, he said exactly the opposite.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   Because they did not know me, they will not know you. Because they rejected me, they will reject you.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   He said, "You are heading toward a difficult life because of me."
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   Yet everything inside of us fights against that, praising Jesus for that, teaching people for doing that.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:08.000]   Yet with every ounce of energy, we fight against what he tells us.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   Andrew did his job and then just went home. He just went home.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   Andrew's name, his name itself, means manly or strong.
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:33.000]   Especially in our culture today, like, you know, it's like, "Oh, what is manly?"
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   It's like toxic masculinity and they say all this stuff, but Andrew, his name was a man.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   We don't know much about him, but church tradition says that he went north when everybody else kind of scattered
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   all the way up to Russia and possibly to Scotland.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   And Andrew ended up converting some Roman official's wife, and he got so angry,
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:00.000]   they tried to get her to recant and she would not, so they ended up crucifying him.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   And even as he is hanging on the cross for two days, you know, typically when somebody is hung on the cross,
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   it was meant to torture, and it was not an easy and quick death.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   Jesus died almost instantly that day, but that cross was not made for that.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   The cross was made to prolong your suffering.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   And the accounts say that some people who were hanging on the cross lasted there over a week.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.500]   In suffering.
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:32.500]   Andrew was hanging on the cross and it took him two days to suffocate and die.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:39.500]   And it says, according to church account, it says for two days he preached the gospel to everyone who was coming by.
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.500]   Till his last breath.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.500]   Most people know about Peter hanging upside down.
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:50.500]   We know about John who was trying to be boiled, you know, we know about the beheading.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.500]   Very few of us know what happened to Andrew.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.500]   Because Andrew was the man that he called us to be.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:04.500]   We have a tendency to look to Moses, to David, to Peter, to Paul, and we emulate them.
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.500]   There are books written about them.
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:13.500]   But if you look carefully at scripture, Christ calls us to be Andrew.
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:18.500]   We have celebrities and we have these big men, these scholars, we have mega churches,
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.500]   but majority of church history, majority of church, majority of mission are done by people like Andrew.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:33.500]   Who just faithfully serve in the background and when it's time to go home, they just went home.
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:38.500]   You could already tell that Andrew was a good disciple.
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:43.500]   Not just of Jesus, but of John the Baptist.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.500]   Because just like John the Baptist, he started out his ministry by saying,
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.500]   "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.500]   But after Jesus shows up, what does John say?
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:56.500]   What is John known for?
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:02.500]   When Jesus shows up, he says, "He must increase and I must decrease."
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.500]   And then he's gone. Just like that.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:09.500]   Some people were thinking that maybe he's the Messiah, maybe he's Elijah.
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.500]   That's how popular he was.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.500]   But you see, as soon as Jesus shows up, he says, "He must increase, I must decrease."
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:22.500]   He did such a good job with Andrew and that's exactly what Andrew does.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:31.500]   He introduces people to Christ and he goes to the background and then he goes home.
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:35.500]   That's our calling. That is our calling.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.500]   That is our calling.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.500]   That is the cross.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.500]   That is the desire for dying of ourselves.
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:49.500]   That desire for drummer's instinct, drummer major's instinct is killing us.
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:52.500]   It's ruining our marriage.
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:55.500]   We're giving to the rat race.
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:59.500]   Even though we're training our children with Sunday school lessons,
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:06.500]   but by the way we're raising them is so that they can compete and win in this rat race.
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:10.500]   Do they really know that it doesn't matter?
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:15.000]   Do our children really know that even if they win, they lose?
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   Do they really know that by the way that we're raising our children?
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   Are we teaching them what the Bible says and showing them what the world teaches?
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   Andrew is what we have called to be.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:40.000]   Andrew is who we need to strive to be.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   Work hard to point to Christ and then just go home.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   Thank you.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   Our church cannot be filled with Peters.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   One Peter is enough.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   Even though we have two.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   I don't want to go to a church filled with this Peter.
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:08.000]   I'm aware of who I am.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   I know the good in me, but I'm also very aware of the bad in me.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   I would hate to disciple you to become just like me.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   But I would in no shame with a clear conscience wish that this church is filled with Andrews.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   This church is built with Andrews.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   Serve faithfully, quietly, without grumbling, point to Christ.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.500]   And when our job is over, go home and look for glory up there, not here.
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:52.500]   Let's pray.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:58.500]   Lord, we thank you so much for the example of our brother Andrew.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:10.500]   Without glory, without honor, without distinction, how he faithfully served you and received his reward in heaven.
[01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:14.500]   Help us, Lord God, to be like this man.
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:25.500]   To be strong and manly, to point to Christ that we would not receive the glory, that we would not receive the distinction, but Christ and Christ alone.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.500]   Help us, Lord God, to build a church that the next generation will follow.
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:34.500]   Not us, but Christ and Christ alone.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:37.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.500]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:53.500]   [Music]
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:19.500]   [Music]
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:29.500]   [Music]
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.500]   You are my supply.
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.500]   You are my supply.
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:39.500]   My breath of life.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:44.500]   Still more awesome than I know.
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.500]   You are my reward.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.500]   Worth living for.
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:55.500]   Still more awesome than I know.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.500]   I love you.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:01.500]   It's more than enough for
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.500]   All of me.
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:07.500]   For every thirst and
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.500]   Every need.
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:13.500]   You satisfy me.
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.500]   With your love
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.500]   And all I have of you
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:22.500]   Is more than enough.
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:30.500]   [Music]
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.500]   You are my sacrifice.
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:37.500]   You are my sacrifice.
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:41.500]   My greatest pride.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:46.500]   Still more awesome than I know.
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:50.000]   You're my carnal gain.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   You are everything.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   Still more awesome than I know.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000]   I love you.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   It's more than enough for
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   All of me.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   For every thirst and
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   Every need.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   You satisfy me.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.500]   With your love
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:21.500]   And all I have of you
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.500]   Is more than enough.
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:27.500]   More than all I want.
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:31.500]   More than all I need.
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:36.500]   You are more than enough for me.
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:39.500]   More than all I know.
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:44.500]   More than all I can say.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.500]   You are more than enough.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.500]   I love you.
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:53.500]   It's more than enough for
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.500]   All of me.
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:59.500]   For every thirst and
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.500]   Every need.
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:06.500]   You satisfy me.
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:09.500]   With your love
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.500]   And all I have of you
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.500]   Is more than enough.
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.500]   Let's pray.
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.500]   Isaiah 42, 5-8
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:25.500]   Thus says the God Lord, who created the heavens and stretched them out,
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:29.500]   who spread out the earth and its offspring, who gives breath to the people on it,
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.500]   and spirit to those who walk in it.
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:34.500]   I am the Lord, I have called you in righteousness.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:37.500]   I will also hold you by the hand and watch over you.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:41.500]   And I will appoint you as a covenant to the people, as a light to the nations,
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.500]   to open blind eyes, to bring out prisoners from dungeon
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:47.500]   and those who dwell in darkness from the prison.
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:50.500]   I am the Lord, that is my name.
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:55.500]   I will not give my glory to another, nor my praise to graven images.
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:59.500]   Help us, Lord God, to see the example of Christ,
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:03.500]   that we would not desire or touch your glory.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:09.500]   Help us simply to be servants that points to Christ, that introduces Christ,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.500]   whether it is our family, our children, our neighbors, our friends,
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:18.500]   that they would know that the hope is in Christ and Christ alone.
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:23.500]   Wherever you send us, help us, Lord God, to be the aroma of Christ.
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:30.500]   God sent his son.
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:36.500]   They called him Jesus.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:46.500]   He came to love, heal and forgive.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:56.500]   He lived and died to buy my body.
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:06.500]   An empty grave is there to put my Savior's lips.
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:16.000]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:26.000]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:46.500]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
