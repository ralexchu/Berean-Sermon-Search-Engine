[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.740]   Before the dawn of time
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:57.740]   You spoke and all creation came to be
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.740]   The molecules and planets
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.740]   Reveal your great design
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:16.740]   And everyone was made so we could see
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:22.740]   So we could see
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.740]   You are the glorious Christ
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.740]   The greatest of all delights
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.740]   Your power is unequal

[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:43.740]   No greater sacrifice
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.740]   When you lay down your life
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.740]   We join the song of angels
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.740]   Who praise you day and night
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.740]   You are the glorious Christ
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:06.740]   [Music]
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.740]   You wrap the air of heaven
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.740]   To breathe the dust of earth
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:26.740]   And dwell among the outcast and poor
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.740]   You came to be forsaken
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.740]   And died to take our curse
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:45.740]   So you could be our joy forevermore
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:51.740]   Forevermore
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.740]   You are the glorious Christ
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.740]   The greatest of all delights
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.740]   Your power is unequal
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.740]   Your love beyond all heights
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.740]   No greater sacrifice
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.740]   When you lay down your life
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.740]   We join the song of angels
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.740]   Who praise you day and night
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.740]   Glorious Christ
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.740]   [Music]
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.740]   You're seated now in heaven
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.740]   Enthroned at God's right hand
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:40.740]   You shouted death and freedom from our fears
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.740]   And though we cannot see you
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.740]   You're coming back again
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:52.740]   And all will be made right when you appear
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:12:01.740]   And all will be made right when you appear
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.740]   You are the glorious Christ
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:11.740]   The greatest of all delights
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.740]   Your power is unequal
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.740]   Your love beyond all heights
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.740]   You are the glorious Christ
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.740]   The greatest of all delights
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.740]   Your power is unequal
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.740]   Your love beyond all heights
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:38.740]   No greater sacrifice
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.740]   When you lay down your life
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.740]   We join the song of angels
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.740]   Who praise you day and night
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.740]   Glorious Christ
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:59.740]   Glorious Christ
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.740]   Glorious Christ
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.740]   We praise you, we praise you day and night
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:12.740]   You're the greatest of all delights
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.740]   [Music]
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:44.740]   [Music]
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.740]   Oh, kneel me down again
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:54.740]   Here at your feet
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:14:04.740]   Show me how much you love humility
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:09.740]   Oh, spirit be the star
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:14.740]   That leads me to
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.740]   The humble heart of love
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.740]   I see in you
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.740]   You are the God of
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:36.740]   All right, good morning.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.740]   Again, we want to welcome all our church members
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.740]   who are joining us for Sunday morning worship
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.740]   and also for the guests who have been invited
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.740]   and you're here participating in the worship together
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.740]   with us this morning.
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.740]   And I know we're very eager to see
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.740]   when the church is going to open.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.740]   We don't have the exact date.
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.740]   We are planning and we're trying to do everything
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.740]   that we can to prepare for at least in the first phase
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.740]   of the opening of the church.
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.740]   We'll have a little bit more detailed announcements
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.740]   during the members meeting.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.740]   But even if you are not able to come to that
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.740]   or maybe you're not a member but you're participating
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.740]   and you want to know what's going on,
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.740]   we'll have that information on the Facebook page.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.740]   And if you're on our email list,
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.740]   we will also be sending that out to you on email.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.740]   So be patient with us and I don't think
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.740]   it's going to be too long.
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.740]   But again, we're just patiently waiting
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.740]   and doing everything that we can to prepare
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.740]   for whenever that may be.
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.740]   We have a few announcements again.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.740]   Just a reminder, today at 3 p.m.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.740]   we have a Zoom members meeting.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.740]   And this is a members meeting that we had
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.740]   originally scheduled to do at church.
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.740]   And so we're asking all the members
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.740]   to come into the meeting.
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.740]   We have some very important announcements to make
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.740]   that will be relevant to the whole church.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.740]   And so please come to that at 3 p.m.
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.740]   The door to that or the room will be open at 2.45.
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.740]   So if you want to just come earlier
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.740]   and hang out with some people, you can do that.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.740]   But the meeting will start sharp at 3 p.m.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.740]   Sign up for Sunday worship service.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.740]   We had the sign-ups open up last Sunday.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.740]   And again, the date is tentative.
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.740]   I said May 31st.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.740]   We're hoping that we may be able to do that.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.740]   But again, right now we're watching
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.740]   what's going on in the government
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.740]   and what they are allowing and not allowing.
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.740]   So we're going to do our best to submit
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.740]   to what the government is,
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.740]   the guidelines that they're giving us.
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.740]   And so again, those dates,
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.740]   no dates that we give you now will be permanent
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.740]   because it's very fluid and it may change
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.740]   depending on what's going on.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.740]   But again, all those stuff, we'll give more announcements
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.740]   at the members meeting,
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.740]   and we'll post it up on Facebook afterwards.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.740]   But the live service, we ask you to sign up
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.740]   that if we do do it or when we do it,
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.740]   we're going to have at 8.30, 10.30, and 12.30,
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.740]   three services.
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.740]   And again, for parents with young children,
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.740]   only if the children are old enough
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.740]   to be able to sit with you and not move around,
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.740]   they have to be watched by the parents,
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.740]   they can't go to the bathroom by themselves.
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.740]   And again, afterward, they would have to leave.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.740]   And so most of the church will be shut down,
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.740]   only the main sanctuary with social distancing
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.740]   and all of that stuff.
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.740]   From what I am told,
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.740]   that all three services are already full,
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.740]   and so there is a survey that's going to be sent out,
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.740]   I think early today, right?
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:36.740]   Yeah.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.740]   A survey's going to be sent out
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.740]   because there's a possibility that we may open up
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.740]   an afternoon service,
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.740]   whether that may be later afternoon or early afternoon,
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.740]   and possibly led by Pastor Mark,
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.740]   and he will be conducting the service.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.740]   And if we do do that, we want to know
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.740]   how many of you are planning to come to that
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.740]   or are able to come to that as an option,
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.740]   and what time, and so please look out for that
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.740]   so that you can sign up so we'll kind of have an idea
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.740]   of how we can better prepare
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.740]   for the rest of the people that can come.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.740]   And otherwise, again, if you are parents
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.740]   and that you have young children
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.740]   that you cannot be in the service together with the children,
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.740]   for whatever the reason,
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.740]   online live service will continue during that period,
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.740]   just to give you a heads up.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.740]   For weekday Bible study,
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.740]   the coming week is our 16th week of Ephesians,
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.740]   and typically we take a long break during the summertime
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.740]   to kind of get ready for the next section,
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.740]   but because we're all under lockdown,
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.740]   we thought it would be beneficial for the church
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.740]   for us to continue.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.740]   So there is going to be a one-week break,
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.740]   and then after the session, again,
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.740]   there's going to be a Bible study this week,
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.740]   and then there's a one-week break,
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.740]   and then on June 2nd, the second part
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.740]   to finish up the study of the book of Ephesians
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.740]   will be going on after that as well.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.740]   Okay?
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:56.740]   All right.
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.740]   We have some business to take care of.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.740]   We have the good kids list this week.
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.740]   Congratulations, Brandon and Andrew Tang,
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.740]   for doing a great job sitting with your parents.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:14.740]   We want to, again, congratulate Olivia, Maddie, and Arthur Lo.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.740]   We heard that you guys did a great job,
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.740]   and we wanted to give you a shout-out
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.740]   to continue the good work.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.740]   Maddie, there's a pink lollipop waiting for you afterwards.
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.740]   We have some birthdays that we want to give a shout-out.
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.740]   Joy Alejo, she's only one years old,
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.740]   but again, we want to congratulate you
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.740]   for your first year.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.740]   Julia Kang, turning 15.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.740]   Congratulations.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.740]   Happy birthday.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.740]   Timothy Irving, Jr., he is turning 8 this week,
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.740]   so congratulations.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.740]   And then we have a special boy named Isaiah Kim,
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.740]   who's turning 12 tomorrow.
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.740]   Congratulations.
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:50.740]   Okay.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.740]   All right, let's pray for the offering,
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.740]   and we'll jump into our worship today.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.740]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you for your mercy.
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.740]   We thank you for your continued grace.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.740]   Lord, you know our hearts, you know our thoughts
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.740]   even better than we know ourselves.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.740]   We pray, Father God, with all the stuff that's going on
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.740]   around us, help us to anchor in you.
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.740]   That we would not drift back and forth
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:21.740]   with every wind of doctrine,
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.740]   every new information that we get.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.740]   Help us, Lord God, that our confidence in our refuge
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.740]   would be in you and you alone.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.740]   I pray especially for our brothers and sisters, Lord God,
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.740]   and especially in our church, Lord,
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.740]   who are wrestling because of the uncertainty of their business
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.740]   or financial situation because of their jobs.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.740]   I pray, Father God, that you would continue to remind them
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.740]   that you care for them, that you love them.
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.740]   That no matter what circumstance, Lord God,
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.740]   that they are in your hands.
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.740]   And so we pray, Father, that you would help us
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.740]   to continue to keep our eyes on you.
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.740]   That even the offering that we give to you,
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.740]   help us, Lord God, to give as an act of worship.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.740]   That it may be multiplied to magnify your name
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.740]   and to give glory to all that you deserve.
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.740]   We thank you, Father, for this morning.
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.740]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.740]   [music]
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.740]   [music]
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:37.740]   [Here's a short excerpt of the music again.]
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:52.740]   [The music is playing again.]
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.740]   We are not what we should be.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.740]   Heaven saw what we should see.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:06.740]   We've seen your glory, Lord, and looked away.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.740]   Our hearts are bent, our eyes are dim.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.740]   Our finest works are stained with sin.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:21.740]   And emptiness has shattered all our way.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:28.740]   Jesus Christ, shine into our night.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:36.740]   Drive our dark away until your glory fills our eyes.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:43.740]   Jesus Christ, shine into our night.
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:23:02.740]   Shine us to your cross, infinite.
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:09.740]   So we often go astray, chase the world, forget your grace.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:16.740]   But you have never failed to bring us back.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.740]   We feel the depths of what you do.
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.740]   The death you died, the victory won.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:31.740]   And they will wait for us to come alive.
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:38.740]   Jesus Christ, shine into our night.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:46.740]   Drive our dark away until your glory fills our eyes.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:53.740]   Jesus Christ, shine into our night.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:58.740]   Shine us to your cross, infinite.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.740]   So Jesus Christ.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:07.740]   Jesus Christ, shine into our night.
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:15.740]   Drive our dark away until your glory fills our eyes.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:22.740]   Jesus Christ, shine into our night.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:28.740]   Shine us to your cross, infinite.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:25:00.740]   Raises rising, eyes are turning to you.
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.740]   It's entering you.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:12.740]   Hope is stirring, hearts are burning.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:19.740]   We long for you.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:27.740]   'Cause when we see you, we find strength to face it.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:34.740]   And in your presence, all our fears are washed away,
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.740]   washed away.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.740]   Oh, stand up.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.740]   Oh, stand up.
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:54.740]   You are the God who saves us, worthy of all our praise.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.740]   Let's hear the sound.
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:08.740]   Hear the sound of hearts beating each other.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:13.740]   It's entering you.
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:24.740]   In your kingdom, broken lines are made new.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:28.740]   Make us new.
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:36.740]   'Cause when we see you, we find strength to face the day.
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:42.740]   And in your presence, all our fears are washed away,
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:47.740]   washed away.
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.740]   Oh, stand up.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.740]   Oh, stand up.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:27:01.740]   You are the God who saves us, worthy of all our praise.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.740]   Let's hear the sound.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.740]   Oh, stand up.
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.740]   Oh, stand up.
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:19.740]   I'm at the break of your windows, broken in your dreams.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:28.740]   When we see you, we find strength to face the day.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:34.740]   And in your presence, all our fears are washed away.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.740]   'Cause when we see you, when we see you,
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:43.740]   we find strength to face the day.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:50.740]   And in your presence, all our fears are washed away,
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.740]   washed away.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.740]   Oh, stand up.
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.740]   Oh, stand up.
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:10.740]   You are the God who saves us, worthy of all our praises.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.740]   Oh, stand up.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.740]   Oh, stand up.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:24.740]   I'm at the break of your windows, broken in your dreams.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:50.740]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:57.740]   No one could take your place.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:05.740]   My heart beats to worship you.
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:12.740]   I live just to see your face.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:20.740]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:27.740]   No one could take your place.
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:34.740]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.740]   No one like you.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:44.740]   You are my God.
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:51.740]   You're everything to me.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:30:00.740]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.740]   No one like you.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:13.740]   You are my God.
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:20.740]   You're everything to me.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:29.740]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.740]   No one like you.
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:43.740]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:54.740]   No one could take your place.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:31:01.740]   I long for your presence, Lord.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:08.740]   I'm steady, it's my reward.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:15.740]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:22.740]   No one could take your place.
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:27.740]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.740]   There's no one like you.
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:40.740]   You are my God.
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:46.740]   You're everything to me.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:55.740]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.740]   No one like you.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:08.740]   You are my God.
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:15.740]   You're everything to me.
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:23.740]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:30.740]   No one like you.
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:39.740]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:45.740]   No one like you.
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.740]   All right, good morning.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.740]   We're going to be finishing up the "I Am" statement.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.740]   That's on chapter 15, the part 2.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.740]   I didn't get to finish last week, so we're going to finish the part 2 for this week.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.740]   So please turn your Bibles to John chapter 15.
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.740]   And let me read from verse 1 through 11.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.740]   John chapter 15, verses 1 through 11.
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.740]   I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.740]   Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, He takes away.
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:25.740]   And every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it so that it may bear more fruit.
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.740]   You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:34.740]   Abide in me, and I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine.
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.740]   So neither can you unless you abide in me.
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.740]   I am the vine, and you are the branches.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.740]   He who abides in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit.
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.740]   For apart from me you can do nothing.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:49.740]   If anyone does not abide in me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.740]   And they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:57.740]   If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:02.740]   My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples.
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:07.740]   Just as the Father has loved me, and I have also loved you, abide in my love.
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.740]   If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love,
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:14.740]   just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in His love.
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:20.740]   These things I have spoken to you, so that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:22.740]   Let's pray.
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:26.740]   Gracious Father, we pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:30.740]   We pray, Father God, that your Holy Spirit would illumine our hearts,
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:34.740]   that we may understand, and that we may be convicted,
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:38.740]   that we may live lives truly bearing fruit as we abide in Christ.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.740]   In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:45.740]   Alright, so I think we're in what, seventh or eighth week into our lockdown,
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:49.740]   and I know many of you, your life doesn't look much different.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:54.740]   Maybe you're even busier than before because you're going to work physically,
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:57.740]   and you come home and you've got to take care of the kids who are not at school,
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:02.740]   and so maybe some of you, I know some of you are busier, but there's a lot of us,
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:09.740]   and again, we're home, we're eager for the doors to open and for us to come back to church,
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:14.740]   and being locked down, sometimes I wake up, and I don't know if it's Monday,
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.740]   I don't know if it's Saturday, it's kind of like Groundhog Day.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.740]   I don't know if you've ever saw that movie with Bill Murray, where he wakes up
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:27.740]   and the same thing happens day after day after day, and sometimes it kind of feels like that.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.740]   Even this morning, I was talking to Pastor Mark this morning,
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:34.740]   I actually had to go record a sermon for a friend's church,
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.740]   and usually I know it's Sunday because I preach.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:42.740]   I wake up in the morning thinking about the sermon, so I had to give a sermon yesterday,
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:48.740]   and I went to sleep kind of winding down, and then I woke up this morning thinking it was Monday,
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.740]   and I was just relaxing on my bed, thinking like, "What am I going to do?"
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:55.740]   I grabbed some coffee, do my devotions, and then it all of a sudden hit me,
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.740]   it's like, "Oh shoot, it's Sunday," and so I kind of had to hurry and get out of the house.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:04.740]   I don't know about you, but the days are kind of bleeding into the other days,
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:12.740]   and again, I'm eager to have the country open back up and us getting back to work and what we need to do.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:20.740]   You know, bearing fruit, we talked about last week, is absolutely important,
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.740]   whether it's as a Christian or just a regular part of life.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:30.740]   If you're doing anything and you don't see progress, eventually you're going to lose motivation.
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.740]   The text that we're looking at this morning is about bearing fruit,
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:38.740]   and the reason why Jesus says this to his disciples before he leaves is because he's preparing them
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:42.740]   to continue the work that he started after he leaves,
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:47.740]   that their primary task was to take this gospel message, the hope of his death and resurrection,
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.740]   and go plant churches and spread the gospel and make sure that the world hears about
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.740]   and knows about the hope that we have in Jesus Christ.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:02.740]   But as he is preparing them, he also wanted to warn them that the only way that they're going to really bear fruit
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.740]   is if they abide in Christ.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:09.740]   That is the only way that they can truly bear fruit.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:16.740]   In John chapter 15, verse 4, it says, "Abide in me, and I in you, and as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:20.740]   unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in me."
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:25.740]   So let's stop right there and really understand what he is saying here in verse 4,
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.740]   the magnitude of what he's saying.
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.740]   He's not saying that you're not going to bear good fruit.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.740]   He's not saying that you're not going to bear much fruit.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.740]   He says you cannot bear any fruit.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.740]   You can't bear any fruit unless you're abiding in me.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:46.740]   So in other words, from this point on, after I leave, the Holy Spirit is going to come,
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:51.740]   and if you do not abide, if you do not continue, you will bear no fruit.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:55.740]   You will work hard. You will be persecuted.
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:01.740]   You will plant church. You will do all of these things, but you will bear no fruit.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:07.740]   You know, I think one of the biggest lies that the world tells,
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.740]   especially the young ones in our culture,
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:17.740]   is that you would see a great basketball star after he wins the championship,
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.740]   and they interviewed him, "What's the secret to your success?"
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:27.740]   And you would hear this cliche that if you believe in yourself, you can accomplish anything.
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:33.740]   I mean, he may believe that, but it is an absolute lie. That's a lie.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:40.740]   If you believe in yourself that you can fly, you're not going to fly.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.740]   You know what I mean? You can believe in yourself.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:47.740]   If you're 5'5", 250 pounds, or whatever you may be,
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:52.740]   you're not going to dunk, no matter how much you believe in yourself.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:56.740]   There are things that you just cannot do.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.740]   But if you're being trained, like, no, if you believe in yourself,
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.740]   you just put your effort in, somebody wins a--
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.740]   somebody has a company that's multi-billion dollars.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:08.740]   If you just believe in yourself, you'll be a billionaire yourself.
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:13.740]   Now, that may sound like good advice.
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:19.740]   You could try harder, but the problem is that they can endeavor to do something,
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:27.740]   and not only not achieve that, but in the process, just being utterly broken.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:33.740]   It doesn't even come close, and then you kind of lose motivation to do anything else.
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:40.740]   There's a lot of Christians who are working hard and laboring and sacrificing,
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.740]   and maybe you've done that for many, many years, and you look at your Christian life now,
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:49.740]   and it is nowhere near where you thought you would have been.
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.740]   I mean, I could tell you, I'm one of those people.
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:58.740]   I got saved early, and I thought by the time I was 40 years old that I would have had--
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:00.740]   I would have been a certain level.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:05.740]   I would have had the whole Bible memorized when I was younger.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.740]   The ministry that we were a part of was really into Bible memory,
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.740]   and I knew this guy who was--even before Pastor Peter Chung,
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.740]   we had a guy in our Bible study who would memorize books.
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.740]   We would come with two verses, and he would come with, "Oh, I memorized 1 Timothy this week,"
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:24.740]   and then a month later he would say, "Oh, I got 2 Timothy done," and he was just memorizing.
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:29.740]   So I remember when I was young, being in that Bible study, thinking, "You know what?
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.740]   My memory's not as good as him, but by the time I'm 40, I'm going to have this,
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.740]   and I'm going to have this memorized, and I'm going to have this much of the Bible.
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:41.740]   I'm going to have so many people evangelized, so many people discipled."
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:50.740]   Well, I'm over 50, and I'm nowhere near what I was hoping to be when I was 40 years old.
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:55.740]   There's a lot of us who are frustrated, maybe frustrated, because we--
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.740]   it's not because you haven't tried.
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:04.740]   You've tried, and it just didn't turn out the way that you were hoping for.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:16.740]   He says clearly, "True fruit is only going to happen when you abide in the true vine."
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:20.740]   That pretty much summarizes everything I'm going to say this morning.
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:24.740]   So if you're going to go to sleep, make sure you memorize that.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:29.740]   True fruit can only happen when you abide by the true vine.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:37.740]   So when you're not abiding by the true vine, whatever fruit that you may think that you see
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:44.740]   may not be real fruit, unless the Bible is lying.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:51.740]   True fruit can only come from abiding by the true vine.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:59.740]   You can teach the Bible regularly, not abiding in Christ, and really bear no fruit.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.740]   You can go to short-term missions, share the gospel with many people,
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:08.740]   and not be abiding in Him and bear no fruit.
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:12.740]   You can have a growing church filled with hundreds, even thousands of people,
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:18.740]   when we are not abiding in Christ isn't true fruit.
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:24.740]   Everything that we experience, or what seems to be fruit, outside of abiding in Christ
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.740]   may not be real fruit at all.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:33.740]   And sometimes it's actually more dangerous to be surrounded by what we think is fruit
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.740]   when the Bible says, "No, it's not real fruit at all."
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:41.740]   Because He said you cannot bear any fruit unless you are abiding in Christ.
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:48.740]   How central is this message to the church and to Christianity in general?
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:54.740]   In everything that we do, how central? This is the core.
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.740]   Again, if you missed this, you've missed everything about our Christian faith.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:04.740]   So our primary pursuit, before we evangelize the world, before we attract people to the church,
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.740]   before we even open it back up so that we can have corporate worship,
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:13.740]   our primary pursuit has to be, "Are we abiding in Christ?"
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:18.740]   Luke 6, 43-44 says, "For no good tree bears bad fruit,
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:23.740]   nor, again, does a bad tree bear good fruit. For each tree is known by its own fruit.
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:30.740]   For figs are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor are grapes picked from bramble bush."
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.740]   It says you cannot bear fruit.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:39.740]   So the central question that we have to ask is, "Then what does it mean to abide in Christ?"
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.740]   What does it mean to abide in Christ?
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:45.740]   I remember the first time when I was studying this passage and doing quiet time,
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:49.740]   I just assumed abide basically meant to obey.
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:54.740]   Obey Christ. And as long as you obey, as long as you do what He tells you to do,
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.740]   then we're going to bear fruit.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:03.740]   But the word for abide here is much more nuanced than just simple obedience.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:09.740]   He's telling His disciples more than just, "Just do what I say," which is part of the meaning.
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:13.740]   In fact, I asked you, I think, last week to look up different translations
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.740]   to see how this word is translated because this is one of those words
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.740]   that can't be translated with one English word.
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:23.740]   So if you speak more than one language, you know that there are certain words
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:27.740]   that you really need to understand the culture to be able to translate
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:31.740]   and really have a correct and precise understanding of that word.
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:35.740]   Well, this is one of those words. In the Greek, it's "meno."
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:40.740]   So some of your translations will say "abide." Some of your translations will say "to remain."
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:47.740]   Some of your translations in other parts of the Bible, that same word is translated "to dwell."
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:54.740]   So what I want to do this morning is, again, to jump into the specific nuanced meaning of this word
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:59.740]   because it's central to us bearing fruit, no matter what we do.
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:04.740]   The first and the most obvious thing that He is saying is to dwell.
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:10.740]   To dwell in Christ. To dwell in Christ. In other words, to make your home in Christ.
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.740]   And we talked about that last week.
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:17.740]   How the Holy Spirit was sent and He dwelt within us.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:21.740]   And so He said the Holy Spirit isn't going to leave us as orphans.
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:27.740]   And so as He dwells in us, He says that you need to also dwell within Him to make your home.
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:30.740]   And there's a big difference.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:35.740]   As, like, sleeping at a hotel, this is where you sleep versus your home.
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:40.740]   And you know what your home is. Home is, you can go out and have the best vacation,
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.740]   but at the end of it, you know, you always look forward to going home.
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:47.740]   Because home is where your bed is. Home is where your fridge is.
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:51.740]   Home is where your bathroom, your showers, right, and your comfortable stuff is.
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:54.740]   And home is ultimately where your family is.
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:46:00.740]   And so when you are at home is when you find refuge, when you find your comfort.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:08.740]   So when He says to make your dwelling in Christ, He's saying make sure that Christ Himself is your refuge.
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:13.740]   He's your home. He's the one that you run to before you run to your friends.
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.740]   Before you run to the leaders.
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.740]   Before you run to see if your bank account has enough money.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.740]   That Christ Himself is our home.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:28.740]   You know, as soon as the lockdown happened, and you can just see the various responses that people have,
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:31.740]   you know, with this COVID-19.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:35.740]   And understandably, you know, a lot of people freaked out.
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:39.740]   A lot of us freaked out because the real threat of death, if, you know,
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:45.740]   they were throwing out this outrageous numbers of millions of people may possibly die.
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:50.740]   And every single one of us is going to know somebody who's going to get it and then die from it.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.740]   And so these crazy numbers were being thrown out.
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:57.740]   And a lot of this lockdown happened because of fear of death.
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:01.740]   But I think in some sense was good for us as Christians.
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:05.740]   Because it caused us to take a step back and ask ourselves,
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:10.740]   do I fear God more than death itself?
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.740]   Or do I fear like the rest of the world?
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:19.740]   What do I run to? Do I run to the supermarket and if I have enough things stored up in my garage that I'm safe?
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.740]   Did I get enough toilet paper? Did I get enough hand sanitizers?
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.740]   Is my job going to be safe after all this is over? Is that going to happen?
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:31.740]   Or if I don't have enough money, is the government going to pass a bill where they're going to help me for a while?
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.740]   Where is our refuge?
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.740]   Well, first and foremost, Jesus is saying, I'm going to leave you.
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.740]   And he's talking to people who are anxious because he's about to leave them.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.740]   And he says, I'm not going to leave you as orphans.
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:46.740]   As the Holy Spirit is going to be sent and he's going to indwell in you,
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.740]   you need to also continue to dwell with him.
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.740]   In Psalm 27, 4 to 5, it says,
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:59.740]   One thing I have asked of the Lord that I shall seek, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:03.740]   When he says one thing that I ask, he's not saying he's one of many things.
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:08.740]   He's saying above all these other things, I ask more than anything else,
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:13.740]   more than long life, more than prosperity, more than safety from this world,
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.740]   more than a good government, more than a good king.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:21.740]   One thing that I ask, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.740]   To behold his beauty.
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:32.740]   Because beholding his beauty, beholding his glory can't be done when we are away from him.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:35.740]   When our hearts are chasing after the things of this world,
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:41.740]   the greatest consequence of drifting away from God is that we no longer behold his glory.
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.740]   And that's why he says, I want to be in the house of the Lord,
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:49.740]   that I may continue to behold his glory and to meditate in his temple, in his home.
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:54.740]   For in a day of trouble, he will conceal me in his tabernacle.
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:59.740]   In other words, if Christ is our home, if he is our dwelling,
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:04.740]   when I am in his temple, he will protect me.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:11.740]   Not the walls of my house, not the economy, not some vaccine, but he will concede me.
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.740]   In the secret place of his tent, he will hide me.
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:16.740]   He will lift me up on a rock.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.740]   He's my foundation.
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:24.740]   We can find a vaccine tomorrow, and all of a sudden this fear of death goes away.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.740]   At least this small part of it.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.740]   There's a thousand different ways that we can die,
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:34.740]   but at least this part of it that's being hyped up right now, that will be taken care of.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:38.740]   But the psalmist says, that's not where I find my refuge.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:42.740]   That is not where I find my rock.
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.740]   He says, it is in his temple. It is in his house.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.740]   He conceals me. He hides me.
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:48.740]   He's the one who lifts me up on a rock.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:52.740]   That's what it means to dwell, to remain in Christ.
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.740]   In Psalm 84, 10 through 11, he also says,
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:50:01.740]   "For a day in your courts is better than a thousand outside."
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.740]   I would rather stand at the threshold of the household of my God
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.740]   than dwell in the tents of the wickedness.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:10.740]   In other words, he's saying, I'd rather be in a courtyard of my God's house
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:13.740]   than to be in the inner room.
[00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:16.740]   In other words, in its comfort. That's what he means.
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:20.740]   For to be near the Lord is much better
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.740]   than to be in the inner chamber of the world.
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.740]   For the Lord God is a sun and a shield.
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.740]   The Lord gives grace and glory.
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:32.740]   No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:36.740]   Well, so how do we make this dwelling?
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:40.740]   The question that we have to ask ourselves and answer
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.740]   repeatedly over and over again from time to time is,
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.740]   do you believe this?
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.740]   When Jesus says he is the resurrection and life,
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.740]   that even if you die, you shall live.
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:55.740]   And he asks them, do you believe this?
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:59.740]   When he asks his disciple, who do men say that I am?
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.740]   That you're the prophet, you're Elijah.
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.740]   He said, but who do you say that I am?
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:08.740]   Peter's response, you are thus the Christ,
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:12.740]   the son of the living God.
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.740]   And so the question isn't, what do my pastors believe?
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.740]   What does the church believe?
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.740]   What does my denomination believe?
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:21.740]   What do you believe?
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:25.740]   Is he truly your refuge?
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:28.740]   You know, I remember hearing Chuck Smith,
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.740]   you know, obviously the founder of Calvary Chapel,
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:34.740]   and he probably had one of the biggest spiritual influences,
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:39.740]   that God used him to bring the Jesus movement in the 1970s.
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:44.740]   And he gives a testimony about how in the earlier part of the church,
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:49.740]   how he, you know, really felt like that this is a church that he needed to build,
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.740]   and he started a project to build this church,
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:54.740]   but they eventually ran out of money.
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.740]   And he was praying, and they had a certain bill that was coming up,
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.740]   and he was praying to God, and he was getting anxious and anxious
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:02.740]   as the time was coming, and all of a sudden he said,
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:07.740]   a member, somebody he didn't know that well, called him and said,
[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:10.740]   "Pastor, God really convicted me to give you an offering."
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:14.740]   And then he said, "I'm going to be sending you a check."
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:18.740]   And when he said the amount, he said he was floored,
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:24.740]   because that was exactly the amount of money that he needed to get to the next stage.
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:28.740]   And he said that he was rejoicing and thanking God for answering his prayer,
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:34.740]   and he was so happy about that phone call,
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:39.740]   but then he says afterwards he felt a strong rebuke in his heart,
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:44.740]   because he says, again in his testimony,
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:47.740]   he rejoiced more over the promise of that man over the phone
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:50.740]   than the promise that God gave him, that if you seek his kingdom
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:55.740]   and all his righteousness, all these things shall be added unto you.
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:59.740]   And he shares in his testimony how it revealed in his heart
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:03.740]   that he trusted more from what that man said on the phone
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:07.740]   than what his father says in his word.
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:11.740]   And so he shares how God revealed early on in ministry,
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:15.740]   how even in the context of doing God's work,
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:19.740]   where we use our own effort and our confidence comes from man,
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.740]   if we're not careful.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.740]   And so that's the first understanding of the word.
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:25.740]   Is he dwelling in Christ? Is he our refuge?
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.740]   Is he the one that we run to?
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.740]   Second meaning, to remain.
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:34.740]   The word to remain means to continue, to keep going.
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:39.740]   And again, this was given to the disciples because Jesus was leaving,
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.740]   he's going to be crucified,
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:45.740]   and he also knew that the disciples were going to be scared,
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:48.740]   and that the leaders of Israel, just like they came after Jesus,
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.740]   they're going to come after them.
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:53.740]   And he's telling them that when this happens, Peter,
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:55.740]   when you deny me three times,
[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:58.740]   and you're in fear hiding from these people,
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:01.740]   when you come back to your senses,
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:08.740]   remember, the safest place for you to be is to continue with me, to remain.
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.740]   Even if it seems like this is crazy,
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:15.740]   that if we continue with Jesus, we may actually go to the cross.
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:18.740]   And they were probably thinking, they probably remember,
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.740]   Jesus said, "If you want to come after me, you must pick up the cross."
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:24.740]   And maybe they kind of heard it metaphorically,
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:26.740]   because they didn't understand.
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.740]   Even when Jesus says, "I'm going to the cross," they didn't understand.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:33.740]   So maybe when they heard it, they kind of said, "Oh, maybe he meant sacrifice."
[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:36.740]   Kind of a lot of the way that we take it, right?
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:40.740]   It means to live, you know, persevere through persecution,
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:42.740]   or make difficult decisions.
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.740]   But when Jesus actually went to the cross,
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.740]   I'll bet you it was kind of going off on their heads,
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.740]   like, "Oh my gosh, he actually meant it."
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.740]   He literally meant, "He's going to die, and you need to die."
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.740]   He actually meant it physically.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:00.740]   That's exactly what he meant to his disciples.
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:03.740]   "If you want to come after me, you need to deny yourself,
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:05.740]   pick up your cross, and follow me."
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.740]   And so he's telling his disciples, when that temptation comes,
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:12.740]   if I continue to go down this path, there's uncertainty.
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.740]   There's death, persecution.
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:16.740]   I may lose my job.
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.740]   I may not be able to pay my bills.
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:21.740]   I may not be able to continue to go down this path.
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.740]   And you have people, maybe even other Christians,
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:28.740]   who are trying to dissuade you from picking up your cross.
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:32.740]   And Jesus reminded his disciples, he says, "No, you continue.
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:36.740]   You continue. You continue to remain."
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:40.740]   You know, 1 John 2, verse 19, John says,
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:43.740]   in his other letter, "They went out from us,
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.740]   but they were not of us.
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:48.740]   For if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:51.740]   For they went out that it may become plain
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:54.740]   that they all are not of us."
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:57.740]   Now, when John was writing this epistle, 1 John,
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.740]   he was talking to a different group of people
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:01.740]   because significant time has already passed
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.740]   from the time of Jesus' death and resurrection.
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:10.740]   But I bet that Apostle John never forgot about Judas
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:14.740]   because what he says here is exactly what Jesus said about Judas
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:17.740]   before he gets to chapter 15.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:20.740]   He warned them, "Judas is going to leave us.
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:22.740]   He's going to betray me."
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.740]   And he said, "You released him to go."
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:28.740]   And so John is saying it's because he did not continue.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.740]   If he was really of us, he would have continued.
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:34.740]   He would have remained with Christ.
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:38.740]   And so now he reminds us of what Jesus said to them.
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:41.740]   If you want to continue, you must remain.
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:44.740]   But what does it mean to remain in Christ?
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:49.740]   In Hebrews 3.6, we're going to be jumping back into Hebrews pretty soon.
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.740]   I'm not going to guarantee it's going to be next week,
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.740]   but possibly the week after for sure.
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.740]   But we've been studying through the book of Hebrews,
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:58.740]   and the whole book of Hebrews is a warning and encouragement
[00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:01.740]   not to drift.
[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:04.740]   So you will see that idea repeated over and over again
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:06.740]   all throughout the book of Hebrews
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.740]   because the central theme,
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:13.740]   central thing that he's warning the recipients of this letter is not to drift.
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.740]   And that's why he says over and over again, Hebrews 3.6,
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:20.740]   "And we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:23.740]   and are boasting in our hope."
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:26.740]   You know why he's telling them to hold fast?
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:29.740]   It's because they were holding on loosely.
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:31.740]   They weren't rejecting Christ.
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.740]   They weren't pursuing idolatry.
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:36.740]   It's just that when it was a little bit too hard to go this path,
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:39.740]   they would kind of go the easier path.
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:41.740]   If it was too difficult to say this,
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:44.740]   and they kind of toned it down and said it the other way.
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:47.740]   A lot of the ways that we avoid hardship in our lives
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.740]   is not to completely reject it.
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:51.740]   We just kind of tone it down a little bit.
[00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:53.740]   Don't be crazy.
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:54.740]   Don't say it like that.
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:57.740]   You can preach the gospel, but don't say that.
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.740]   You can tell them about the love of Christ, but don't talk about hell.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.740]   You can talk about Jesus being the only way,
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:06.740]   but don't say he's the only way and all the other ways are wrong.
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:10.740]   So we kind of tone it down a little bit.
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:15.740]   And we try to make the path that we're on as easy as possible.
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:19.740]   When he says to hold on, hold fast,
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:22.740]   is that these truths that you are convicted about,
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:24.740]   that you don't compromise,
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.740]   that you hold on to dear life.
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:31.740]   Hebrews 3.14, "For we share in Christ if indeed we hold our original confidence
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.740]   firm to the end."
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.740]   That the things that we were convicted about,
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:40.740]   when he opened our eyes to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:46.740]   that ten years later that you've become compromised and you've drifted.
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:49.740]   Hebrews 4.14, "Since then we have a great high priest
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:51.740]   who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God.
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:55.740]   Let us hold fast our confession."
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:57.740]   Hold fast.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:01.740]   And we just kind of, "Ah, I got on the boat so we're safe."
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:07.740]   A lot of confessing Christians are more than perfectly satisfied
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:12.740]   that they made a good decision sometime way back in life.
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:15.740]   And then now we're just kind of, "I'm on the boat,
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.740]   and wherever this boat takes me."
[00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:22.740]   And so, you're the captain, so take the boat, and I'm just on it.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:24.740]   That was the danger of these people,
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.740]   these second, third-generation Christians, and even in the first century.
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:31.740]   They were just beginning to drift and not holding fast.
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:36.740]   Hebrews 6.11, "And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:42.740]   so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end."
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:46.740]   Again, there's a lot of people who are absolutely certain of their faith
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:48.740]   in the beginning of their walk with God.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:51.740]   Five, ten, fifteen, twenty years later,
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:54.740]   they have a lot of doubts that crept into their hearts.
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:57.740]   And the reason why is because they weren't holding fast.
[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.740]   They were drifting.
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:03.740]   And once you are far, far away from Christ,
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.740]   the glory of Christ is just a memory.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:10.740]   It is not a present thing that you are experiencing.
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.740]   It's something that you saw maybe years ago,
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.740]   and you're always trying to look back and say,
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.740]   "Oh, I remember when he was like that.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.740]   I remember when I was like that."
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:21.740]   It's not a current testimony.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:25.740]   It's not your current state of mind,
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:28.740]   meaning that we've drifted.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:33.740]   So he says, "Hold fast to show the same diligence to continue to remain."
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.740]   Hebrews 10.23, "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.740]   without wavering for he who promised is faithful."
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.740]   Hold fast because God does not change.
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:45.740]   Same Christ that we met when we first met him is the same Christ today.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:49.740]   The same things that he desired of us when we first met him
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.740]   is the same Christ that desires the same thing of us today.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.740]   He says to hold fast.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:59.740]   You know, years ago, I had a friend who was getting married,
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.740]   and again, this is many, many years ago,
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:06.740]   and we decided to take him to whitewater rafting.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.740]   And so I've never been whitewater rafting,
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.740]   so we thought it would be fun.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:14.740]   And they made a sign, a waiver, saying that you can drown,
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:19.740]   you can die, all this stuff, and it's like, "How dangerous could it be?"
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:24.740]   I know that we don't normally sign these waivers that we may get hurt or die
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.740]   and that it's not your responsibility.
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:32.740]   And it's kind of nerve-wracking to get into a boat, a tiny little raft.
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:36.740]   But we think, if they do this for a living, it can't be too bad.
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:39.740]   But what we didn't realize was right before we got into that boat,
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:42.740]   El Nino happened like a month before.
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.740]   And so there was a lot of water that wasn't normal,
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.740]   that even the instructors were not used to.
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.740]   And so we got into the boat, and we were going down the raft,
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:54.740]   and it was crazy to begin with.
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:56.740]   And I remember the thought that I had was,
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:59.740]   "I can't believe they're letting beginners onto this raft,"
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:03.740]   because we had pictures where we're literally in the water,
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:08.740]   and all you see is water around us because the raft was bent in half.
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:12.740]   And so we were about an hour into it, and we pulled over to take a break.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:19.740]   And all of us who were there to have fun, we were a bit terrified.
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:24.740]   And we were asking, "This is for beginners?"
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:27.740]   And then that's when they explained to us, "Oh, yeah, this is not normal.
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:32.740]   Usually it's pretty calm, and there's a couple places where it gets kind of hairy.
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:35.740]   But because of El Nino, the whole place is like that,
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:38.740]   and so you really need to pay attention."
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:40.740]   Well, after we took a break, we got back onto the raft,
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.740]   and then we turned a corner, and there was a huge rapid,
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:49.740]   and we hit it so hard, one of the guys who was sitting next to me, he flew,
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.740]   and he ended up hitting the instructor on the forehead,
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:55.740]   and he ended up breaking his nose, and then the instructor had stitches,
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:58.740]   so we had to pull over, and he had to be taken to the hospital,
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.740]   and then the instructor had to be changed.
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.740]   But they didn't cancel the raft.
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.740]   They got a new instructor coming in, and so by that time, we're freaking out.
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:13.740]   I was thinking, like, this is before we had kids, that, "Oh, I'm going to bring Esther here.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:14.740]   We're going to have fun doing this."
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.740]   But after that, I said, "No, I'm not bringing Esther here.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.740]   This is not safe."
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.740]   We get back into the boat.
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:23.740]   We have about another 30 minutes, and it was just as hairy.
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:28.740]   But by then, we are, like, full alert.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.740]   But most of the day has gone by.
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.740]   We're kind of at the tail end, and so we think,
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.740]   "You know, we have maybe about 20 more minutes of this,
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:36.740]   and then we're going to be pulled over."
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:38.740]   I said, "Man, this was crazy."
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:44.740]   But right before we make this turn, our instructor pulls us over for no other reason.
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:45.740]   It wasn't a time for a break.
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:51.740]   It wasn't a lunch time, but no other reason other than to get us ready, right?
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:55.740]   And she said, "Everything that you've experienced up to this point
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:58.740]   was pretty elementary compared to what's coming."
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:01.740]   And we were like, "What?"
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:03.740]   Our instructor had to be changed because she had stitches.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.740]   One of our friends broke his nose, so he had to get out of the boat.
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:12.740]   And you're saying that compared to what's coming, it was pretty easy.
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:14.740]   So, I mean, we're starting to get scared.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:15.740]   What's around this corner?
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:20.740]   And I could tell the instructor himself was starting to get anxious.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.740]   So that freaked us out even more.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:25.740]   What's around this corner that this guy does this for a living?
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:28.740]   And he's like, "There's some fear in his eyes."
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.740]   So he said, "When we turn this corner, we hit this raft,
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:34.740]   the waters are going to be pretty high, and once we get into it,
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.740]   there's no way to pull over.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:42.740]   So if you fall into the water, typically their plan is they're going to throw a line
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.740]   and then they're going to try to pull you back in,
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:49.740]   or the next boat that comes will come and grab you and bring you back in."
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:53.740]   But he said, "When we get into this, it's going to be so rough.
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:56.740]   If you fall into the water, we're not going to be able to get you.
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:59.740]   You're going to have to ride this out, you know,
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:02.740]   and you're going to end up drinking some water and we'll see you at the end.
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:04.740]   When it comes calm, then we'll bring you back into the water."
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:07.740]   So in other words, don't fall in.
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:14.740]   And he said, "The only way that we're going to be okay is if you do exactly what I tell you,
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.740]   and when I tell you to throw the oar into the water,
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:20.740]   you guys do it because the only leverage that we have"--
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:24.740]   again, this has become longer than I originally planned.
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:28.740]   But he said that on the raft, if you've ever gone whitewater rafting,
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.740]   they don't have anything to bind you into this boat just in case the boat flips
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.740]   and you're going to drown.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:36.740]   So the only way that you have any kind of leverage is through the oar into the water,
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:39.740]   and that's the only way you can grab onto it.
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:43.740]   So he said, "When I tell you to dig, you just dig and you stay in."
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:47.740]   So we were all hyped up, we're ready to go, and we turned a corner,
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:51.740]   and the water was so high we couldn't see on the other side of that.
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:56.740]   So we're freaking out, our instructor's freaking out, we're going, okay, we're ready.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:02.740]   And right before we hit the raft, the water,
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:06.740]   one of our friends, we turn around, just slips into the water.
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:10.740]   So we're looking at each other like, "Oh, my gosh, we're not in the water yet,
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:12.740]   so do we bring him back in?"
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:15.740]   So we're looking at each other, we're looking at the instructor, what should we do?
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:18.740]   But as we're looking at each other, we're headed to this water.
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:23.740]   So you can tell she's kind of hesitating, and then she says, "Forget him,
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:27.740]   because if we try to bring him in and we hit the raft, we're all going to go in."
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:32.740]   She said, "Let him be, and dig yourself into the water."
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:36.740]   So as soon as he said that, we were ready, and we were ready to turn around,
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:41.740]   and we hit the water, and when we hit the water, our boat went completely vertical.
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:45.740]   And so half of our friends went into the water.
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:48.740]   They happened to be in the very top, and I just yanked in,
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:52.740]   and I hugged the water with my oar, and that's how I was able to stay in.
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:56.740]   But once we got into it, he was right, we couldn't bring them back in.
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:59.740]   We were so busy, just us trying to stay in the water,
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:03.740]   we had no way to bring them back in.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:06.740]   Again, this story goes on and on.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:09.740]   So they were in the water, the next raft that was coming behind,
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:14.740]   they couldn't pay any attention, so they--I forgot, it felt like a good minute
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:17.740]   that we were going down this raft, and we couldn't pull them back into the water
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:18.740]   until we were done.
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:22.740]   We couldn't even see where they were because the raft was so high.
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:25.740]   The reason why I share this story is because all of this is related
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:28.740]   to what Jesus is saying to his disciples.
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:31.740]   He said, "Whatever hardship that you felt up to this point,
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:34.740]   whatever trouble or anxiousness or fear that you felt,
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:38.740]   I'm about to go to the cross.
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:42.740]   There's real danger for your life that's coming around this corner,
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:47.740]   and if you don't pay attention to what I say, if you don't remain in me,
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.740]   you're not going to make it."
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:53.740]   So as much as this is an instruction of how to bear fruit,
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:57.740]   he's telling them that this only way that you're going to survive
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:02.740]   is if you continue to remain in me.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:07.740]   The biggest danger of where you and I are is not burnout.
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:08.740]   It's not burnout.
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:10.740]   We use that word so commonly.
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:12.740]   When I get tired and I don't want to teach anymore,
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.740]   I don't want to serve anymore, I don't want to do this anymore,
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:18.740]   you say, "I'm burned out."
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.740]   The biggest problem where you and I live is not burnout.
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:26.740]   It's being rusted out from lack of work, from lack of diligence,
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:28.740]   from lack of exercising our spiritual muscles,
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:33.740]   lack of holding fast the confession that we had at first.
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:37.740]   So we get busy like everybody else does, not necessarily like we're deep
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:42.740]   into sin, but just busy with life just like everybody else.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:48.740]   The next thing we know, we're not grounded, we're not anchored in Christ.
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:52.740]   But you don't need to be anchored when there's no storm.
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:55.740]   You don't need to be anchored when the waves are calm because you just kind of
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:09:00.740]   sit there, you know, and you don't feel any real danger.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:04.740]   Then all of a sudden the storm comes and you lift your eyes and you realize
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:08.740]   you're nowhere near the shore.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:12.740]   See, if we're not anchored in Christ, we don't feel a sense of urgency
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.740]   until something happens.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:16.740]   COVID-19 happens.
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:17.740]   The world gets shut down.
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:19.740]   There's real fear.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:22.740]   And then persecution comes.
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:26.740]   I don't know about you, but the spiritual environment that we are in now
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:30.740]   versus even just 30 or 40 years ago is night and day.
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:33.740]   The hostility that is coming from even government officials toward
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:40.740]   Christianity and churches have grown exponentially just in the last 10 years.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:44.740]   Persecution, if it's not already here, is coming.
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:49.740]   And we don't realize how far we are until the storm comes.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:52.740]   See, Jesus is telling them.
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.740]   Jesus is telling them, "It's coming.
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:55.740]   Be ready."
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.740]   And the only way that you're going to survive is if you hold fast.
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.740]   You know what's really interesting?
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:06.740]   I was looking up to see, you know, in BBC in England, they did a study in Europe
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:11.740]   to see how many people die simply from lack of activity.
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:18.740]   They said every year, 676,000 people die from lack of activity,
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:22.740]   lack of activity that is related to heart disease, diabetes,
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:26.740]   whatever it is that comes from lack of activity, just being sedentary life.
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:29.740]   He said 676,000 people die from that every year.
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:33.740]   And this is just a study from BBC of Europe.
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.740]   So if you multiply that all throughout the world,
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:38.740]   it's got a minimum at least double that number.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:41.740]   So over a million people die from lack of activity.
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:45.740]   Right now, we're living in fear because of COVID-19.
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.740]   Legitimately, this is a dangerous disease that we need to be careful about,
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:55.740]   but 311,000 people around the whole world has died because of this.
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:11:02.740]   See, the greatest danger in our world usually are not things that you can see clearly.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:09.740]   Usually, the things that destroy us and is most dangerous are things that we are not aware of,
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:13.740]   that we just kind of are relaxed and just kind of let it flow and just kind of drift.
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:18.740]   The next thing you know, when the storm comes, you're not anchored, and the boat flips, and you drown.
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:21.740]   That's why when it is in times of peace,
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:25.740]   when we don't feel the sense of urgency is when we need to hold fast.
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:28.740]   And that's what Jesus is saying.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:32.740]   Remain. Remain and continue.
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:36.740]   Third and finally, it means to depend.
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:39.740]   If we dwell, all of these ideas are connected,
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:44.740]   but again, the specific nuance of this is to dwell with him, to continue with him,
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:48.740]   and to ultimately depend on him.
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:53.740]   Whenever we face troubles or trials, whether it's financial or spiritual,
[01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:59.740]   our natural tendency is to rely on man, whether it's other men or ourselves.
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:04.740]   Let's strategize. Let's have a meeting. Let's identify what the problem is.
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:08.740]   Let's implement some new ideas. Let's organize a little bit differently.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:11.740]   Let's get some right people in the right place to do the right things.
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:16.740]   And if we do it right, it'll fix the problem. That's usually our tendency.
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:20.740]   When Jesus says, "If you don't abide in me, you cannot bear fruit,"
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:26.740]   human problems may be fixed with human ingenuity.
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:30.740]   But the warfare that you and I are in is not against flesh and blood.
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:34.740]   He makes it very clear. It is a spiritual battle.
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:38.740]   So the only way that you and I can have success in a spiritual battle is to engage spiritually.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:43.740]   And so he says, "You must depend on me."
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:48.740]   You must depend on me. Before we strategize, before we implement,
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:52.740]   before we get the right people in the right place to do the right thing,
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:57.740]   do we come to Christ? Is he our ultimate answer?
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:01.740]   See, in Colossians 129, Paul describes his ministry this way,
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:06.740]   "For this purpose also I labor and strive."
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:10.740]   Now if you stop right there, Paul was a hard worker. He persevered.
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:14.740]   He was whooped. He was shipwrecked.
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:18.740]   And yet he persevered. He is a man who was so committed. We need to be committed.
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:23.740]   Which is all true. But if you miss the second part of what he says,
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:27.740]   you can completely pervert what he's trying to say.
[01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:31.740]   "For this purpose also I labor, striving according to his power,
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:35.740]   which mightily works within me."
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:39.740]   Paul is saying he's able to do what he's doing
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:43.740]   because Christ is already working in him.
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:47.740]   Because you cannot bear fruit unless we are abiding in him.
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:52.740]   Paul is able to do what he is doing because God is doing what he is doing with him.
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:57.740]   Ministry and preaching, leading small groups,
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:01.740]   sharing the gospel, even just living our Christian life,
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:05.740]   isn't simply applying and regurgitating things that we heard.
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:09.740]   You know, I can give a sermon and I could, whatever the sermon is,
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:13.740]   you can say, "Oh, I really like that. I was really challenged by that."
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:17.740]   And then that's where it ends. That's where it ends.
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:21.740]   You heard something new. It made you think.
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:25.740]   But it has no power to change you.
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:31.740]   It has no power to bear fruit because true fruit comes from true connection to the true vine.
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:35.740]   Paul says, even as he is striving, he says,
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:39.740]   "I'm able to strive because of the work that he's doing in me."
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:43.740]   Philippians 2, 12-13, "So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed,
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.740]   not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence,
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:51.740]   work out your salvation with fear and trembling."
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:55.740]   Again, Paul says, you need to, not only am I striving,
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:59.740]   but you need to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:03.740]   And I get so many questions about that. What does it mean to work out your salvation?
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:07.740]   What does it mean to have fear and trembling?
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:11.740]   Am I supposed to live day to day in fear of God's judgment?
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:15.740]   Am I supposed to strive and really work it out?
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:19.740]   That sounds really burdensome.
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:25.740]   Especially if you've been walking with God for a while and you're faithfully attending Bible study,
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:29.740]   you're sacrificing, you're giving, and you're doing what you're supposed to do,
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:33.740]   and then he says, "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling."
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:37.740]   Am I supposed to look at his judgment and live in fear? What does that mean?
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:43.740]   Again, when you study the Bible, if you don't study it in the context of everything that he's saying,
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:47.740]   you can easily pervert the meaning of what he's saying.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:51.740]   Work out your salvation with fear and trembling. Verse 13, he says,
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:59.740]   "For it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:03.740]   You notice how he says, "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling"?
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:09.740]   Because the reason why you're able to do that is because God is working in you.
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:13.740]   God is already working in you for his own good pleasure.
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:19.740]   In other words, he's not telling you something like, "Get your act together and do the right thing."
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:24.740]   No. He said, "Allow the Holy Spirit to continue to do what he was given to do."
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:28.740]   Don't quench the Holy Spirit. That's why Ephesians 5, 18, it says,
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:34.740]   "Be filled with the Holy Spirit." Right? "Do not be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Holy Spirit."
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:39.740]   Now, why does he compare being drunk with being filled with the Holy Spirit?
[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:43.740]   He said, "Do not be drunk with wine. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit."
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:46.740]   So he's making a correlation between these two ideas.
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:51.740]   Because being drunk, right? I have no idea what that feels like.
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:57.740]   Some of you guys do. If you've ever been drunk, from what I've been told,
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:00.740]   you're not yourself. Right?
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:05.740]   The alcohol gets into your system, and you say things and do things that you wouldn't normally.
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:08.740]   In other words, the alcohol controls you.
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:11.740]   And it's not, "Oh, that's not him." No, it's you.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.740]   But it's the alcohol in you influencing you.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.740]   And somebody who's normally quiet can become very loud.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:19.740]   Somebody who's very loud can become very quiet.
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:22.740]   Somebody who doesn't normally share, all of a sudden they share all these things.
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:28.740]   And that's why in a lot of social settings, people drink first, so that they can be loose.
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:33.740]   There's a reason why he's comparing, "Do not be drunk with wine."
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:36.740]   And he's not just talking about wine.
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:40.740]   Anything else outside of the influence of the Holy Spirit is like being drunk with wine.
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:46.740]   If you are influenced by the world and world's ideologies and principles,
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:49.740]   if you are chasing after money and the lust of money,
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:54.740]   if you're chasing after influence, if you're chasing after acknowledgement,
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:18:00.740]   whatever it is that is not God, it's like being drunk with wine.
[01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:03.740]   And the wine is influencing your thoughts.
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.740]   It's influencing what is right, influencing your words.
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:10.740]   He says, "Do not be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Holy Spirit."
[01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:13.740]   You know what's interesting about being filled?
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:21.740]   The word "filled," "pleru," is in the present passive imperative.
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:25.740]   What's interesting about that, imperative means it's a command.
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:30.740]   So he says, "Sit down." It means you take your body and you put it onto the chair.
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:32.740]   Sit down.
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:34.740]   But it's in the passive voice.
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:40.740]   Passive voice basically means to let yourself, you receive the action.
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:44.740]   So, oftentimes when you hear the word "imperative,"
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:48.740]   you would think he's telling you to do, you actively do something.
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:51.740]   But because it's in the passive voice, he's saying,
[01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:55.740]   you actively receive the action of the Holy Spirit.
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:57.740]   That's what that means.
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:01.740]   In other words, to sum it up,
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:04.740]   he's saying that the Holy Spirit has already been given you
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.740]   so that you would not be an orphan.
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:08.740]   He made His indwelling in you.
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:14.740]   He was given to you as a seal, as a guarantee, as a deposit,
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:17.740]   guaranteeing your salvation.
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:19.740]   And then he said, "The Holy Spirit was given to you
[01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:24.740]   so that He may intercede and groan with words that you cannot understand,
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.740]   so that He may continue to intercede on your behalf."
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:30.740]   So the Holy Spirit is actively working in you.
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:34.740]   There is no Christian where the Holy Spirit isn't working.
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:38.740]   If the Holy Spirit is not indwelling in you, you are not a Christian.
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:43.740]   So when he says to be filled, present, passive, imperative,
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:48.740]   he's saying live in such a way that the Holy Spirit can take full control over your life.
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:50.740]   That's what that means.
[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:52.740]   It's not to like, okay, raise your hand a certain way,
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:56.740]   or if you sing louder, or if you sing more emotional music,
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:58.740]   or if you do certain things, the Holy Spirit is going to come
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:00.740]   and fill you from top to bottom.
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:04.740]   He says, "No, the Holy Spirit is already working.
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:05.740]   Don't resist Him."
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:09.740]   That's why the Bible talks about not to quench the Spirit,
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:10.740]   not to quench the Spirit.
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:15.740]   In other words, the Holy Spirit is already working in you.
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:20.740]   Do not do and go and do certain things that the Holy Spirit is being resistant.
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:23.740]   And it's in the present tense, meaning to continue.
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:26.740]   It is not something that happens at justification alone,
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:34.740]   but an ongoing, constant work of allowing the Holy Spirit to influence you.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:39.740]   That's why, again, to remain in Christ is to completely depend upon Christ.
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:42.740]   And that's why he says in Acts 1.8,
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:49.740]   "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you."
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.740]   Not when you have memorized enough Scripture,
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.740]   although all of these things are good things,
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:55.740]   not because you know all the theology,
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:57.740]   not because you had the proper training,
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:00.740]   not because you're older and you have a lot of experience,
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:03.740]   not because you read a lot of books.
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:09.740]   He says the power is going to come upon you when the Holy Spirit comes upon you.
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:14.740]   Humanly speaking, if the task was given to us,
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:17.740]   Jesus Christ was crucified, He's resurrected,
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:22.740]   and this is the most important message that the world will ever hear.
[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:30.740]   The consequence of the word not going out is people are going to go to hell.
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:32.740]   People's destinies change.
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:36.740]   There's no greater task than the task that was given to the disciples.
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:39.740]   But imagine if that task was given to us,
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.740]   and saying, "Hey, you guys figure this out."
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:45.740]   Jesus says, "I've done my part. Now you guys figure this out."
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:51.740]   I would imagine there would be a great Bible conference that takes place
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:55.740]   with all the top theologians, all the professors,
[01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:58.740]   all the people who wrote the best systematic theology books,
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:01.740]   all the people who have the largest churches.
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:05.740]   They would get together, and they would have a huge meeting.
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:08.740]   How should we do this?
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:11.740]   Well, we need to have the right people, like who has the influence.
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:14.740]   We have a senator who's among us. Maybe we can use him.
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.740]   We have a multi-billionaire.
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:20.740]   We can use his influence and get his money to back our mission work.
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:26.740]   We have all of these things, and none of it in and of itself may be wrong.
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:31.740]   But Jesus was not asking the disciples to do that.
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:35.740]   Jesus didn't call these fishermen, tax collectors,
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:38.740]   these guys who are easily divided, saying, "I want to be better than this guy.
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:42.740]   These guys are going to fail you, but I won't."
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.740]   They were not the cream of the crop.
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:47.740]   They were not the most educated. They were not the most influential.
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:52.740]   In fact, they just failed miserably, the biggest test in their life.
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:57.740]   And you're going to instruct them to go make disciples? Come on.
[01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:02.740]   I know you're sovereign, but clearly you don't see what we see.
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:07.740]   He didn't entrust it to his disciples. He didn't.
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:11.740]   He entrusted it to the Holy Spirit through the disciples.
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:13.740]   That's the difference.
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:16.740]   Because the point that Jesus was trying to make is the same point
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:19.740]   that God has been trying to make through history.
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:22.740]   He can use donkeys if he wanted to.
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:27.740]   When the Pharisees said, "Hey, stop them from yelling out, 'Hosanna, Hosanna!'"
[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:32.740]   And he says, "If they don't yell out, the rocks will cry out."
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:38.740]   In other words, the key is not in them.
[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:43.740]   That they would look at these untrained men, uneducated men,
[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:47.740]   when they see the power coming through them through their preaching and through their working,
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:51.740]   that people may look at them and say, "These were uneducated men. These were just fishermen."
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:54.740]   But they were clearly with the Lord.
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:58.740]   In other words, they were clearly remaining in Christ.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.740]   They depend on Christ.
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:05.740]   That's why he says before he sends them out, "Wait, because when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:11.740]   you will be my disciple. You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:13.740]   the remotest part of the world."
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:15.740]   He doesn't say, "Try hard."
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:18.740]   He says, "When the Holy Spirit comes, this is going to happen."
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:22.740]   So he wasn't entrusting it to them. He was entrusting it to the Holy Spirit.
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:28.740]   And he tells us to remain in the Spirit, to continue in the Spirit.
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:33.740]   Again, in Psalm 37, 4, "Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart.
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:38.740]   Commit your way to the Lord. Trust also in Him, and He will do it."
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.740]   He will do it.
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:45.740]   "He will bring forth your righteousness as a light, and your judgment as the noon day."
[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:49.740]   So let me wrap up this morning with this.
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:56.740]   At the end of all of this, at the end of all these instructions about continuing the promise of the Holy Spirit
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:25:01.740]   and bearing fruit by remaining, he says, "The reason why you need to do all of this,
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:07.740]   John 15, 7, 'If you abide in me, and my words abide in you,
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:12.740]   ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.'"
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:16.740]   When you are abiding in me, Christ says,
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:22.740]   the reason why you're going to bear fruit is because you're going to be able to pray more effectively.
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:26.740]   John 15, 16, "You did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you,
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:30.740]   that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit will remain,
[01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:35.740]   so that whatever you ask of the Father in my name, He may give to you."
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:40.740]   In other words, why do you need to bear fruit? So that you may be able to pray more effectively.
[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:43.740]   Again, finally, John 16, 23-24,
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:47.740]   "In that day you will not question me about anything. Truly, truly, I say to you,
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:52.740]   if you ask the Father for anything in my name, He will give it to you.
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:55.740]   Until now you have asked for nothing in my name.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:26:00.740]   Ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be made full."
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:10.740]   In other words, the primary gift that God has given us for the purpose of bearing fruit is Himself.
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:14.740]   And the benefit of bearing fruit and abiding in Him
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:21.740]   is that we may have effective prayer, have more of Him.
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:25.740]   Isn't that crazy? And that's why He says in verse 2,
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:28.740]   "Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, He takes away.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:33.740]   And every branch that bears fruit, He prunes so that it may bear more fruit."
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:37.740]   So you notice here, He says, "Bear fruit, that you may bear more fruit,
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:39.740]   that ultimately you may bear much fruit."
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:44.740]   And that's exactly how a living plant is described.
[01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:52.740]   The fourth seed, that He multiplies His fruit 30, 60, 100-fold.
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:57.740]   How much of our joy comes from knowing and experiencing this fruit in our lives?
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:04.740]   Because we have learned the secret of being content is to remain in Christ.
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:07.740]   Think about all the things that we are concerned about today.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:10.740]   All the problems that we need to fix, whether it's relational,
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:16.740]   whether it's financial, whatever it may be.
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:21.740]   Think about how easily we run to human means.
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.740]   And thinking that, you know, we get that done, then we can do some prayer.
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.740]   But I don't have time to pray until I've done my part.
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:34.740]   No. He said, "You can't do your part until we first learn to abide in Christ."
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:39.740]   So again, my prayer is that this unique period of time that God has given us,
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:45.740]   that before we run to anything else, that we carefully examine where we're at.
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:48.740]   Are we truly remaining in Christ?
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:51.740]   Are we dwelling in Christ? Are we continuing in Christ?
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:53.740]   And are we depending in Christ?
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:58.740]   And I pray that as we pursue Christ with all our hearts,
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.740]   that we may truly bear fruit 30, 60, 100 fold.
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:04.740]   Let's pray.
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:10.740]   Gracious and loving Father, we ask for your continued blessing.
[01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:16.740]   We pray, Father God, that however long that we may be in this situation,
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:19.740]   that we would not waste this time that you've given us.
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:22.740]   Help us to deepen our walk with you.
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:26.740]   If we have drifted, help us to see where we're at.
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:29.740]   That we may remember the height from which we have fallen
[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:33.740]   and repent and redo the things that you've given us.
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:35.740]   So we pray, Father God, that you would bless our homes,
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:39.740]   bless the moms and dads who are busy taking care of their children.
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:44.740]   Bless our children that the time that they spend with their parents may be fruitful as well.
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:47.740]   We pray for our workers, especially our health workers, Lord God,
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:50.740]   who are on the front line, that you would protect them and keep them safe.
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:55.740]   Help them to be a good witness, Lord God, and not to be overwhelmed by anxiousness.
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:29:03.740]   But to really use that time, Father God, to show that our fear, our hope, our joy is unlike the world.
[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:07.740]   So we ask, Lord God, that all of this ultimately lead to greater glory,
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:11.740]   greater salvation, and greater revival in the church.
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:18.740]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:35.740]   Today I want to conclude our worship with a benediction from God's word
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:38.740]   in 2 Corinthians 6, verse 16 and on.
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:42.740]   It says, "For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said,
[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:48.740]   'I will dwell in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:52.740]   Therefore come out from among their midst and be separate,' says the Lord,
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:56.740]   'and do not touch what is unclean, and I will welcome you.
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:02.740]   And I will be a father to you, and you shall be sons and daughters to me,' says the Lord Almighty."
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:10.740]   I pray that the Lord's peace be upon you and your household for the rest of this week and forevermore. Amen.

[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:23.740]   God sent his Son
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:30.740]   They called him Jesus
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:36.740]   He came to love
[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:41.740]   He lived for true
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:48.740]   He lived and died
[01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:54.740]   To buy my heart
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:35:00.740]   An empty grave is there to
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:06.740]   Save or fill
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:12.740]   'Cause He lives
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:18.740]   I can face tomorrow
[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:24.740]   Because He lives
[01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:30.740]   All fear is gone
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:36.740]   Because I know
[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:42.740]   He holds a future
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:48.740]   And life is worth the living
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:54.740]   Just because He lives
[01:35:54.740 --> 01:36:01.740]   All glory be to Christ
[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:06.740]   His rule and reign we'll ever sing
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:12.740]   All glory be to Christ
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:19.740]   His will be done, His kingdom come
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:24.740]   On earth as it is above
[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:29.740]   Who is Himself our daily bread
[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:34.740]   Praise Him, the Lord of love
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:39.740]   Let living water satisfy
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:44.740]   The thirsty without price
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:49.740]   We'll take a cup of kindness
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:54.740]   Yet all glory be to Christ
