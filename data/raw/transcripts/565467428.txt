[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   Please turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.800]   We're going to be looking at verses 14, mainly just verse 14 today, but I want to read all
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.160]   the way up to verse 17.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:26.400]   Hebrews chapter 12, verses 14 through 17, reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.340]   To peace with all men and a sanctification without which no one will see the Lord.
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.040]   See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God, that no root of bitterness springs
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.940]   up causes trouble.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.020]   And by it many defiled.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.700]   That there be no immoral or godless person like Esau who sold his own birthright for
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.240]   a single meal.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.880]   For you know that even afterwards when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected,
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.800]   for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.800]   Let's pray.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.400]   Heavenly Father, we pray for guidance.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.000]   I pray that you will protect this pulpit, that only your word would go forth.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.240]   I pray that the hearers, Lord God, will filter only your word to cherish in their hearts.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.920]   And we ask, Lord God, that your Holy Spirit would guide and lead us, that we may understand
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.920]   your word.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.640]   I've shared before that I grew up in a Presbyterian home, but I got saved in a very charismatic
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.880]   para-church ministry.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.560]   I was really into discipleship, one-to-one discipleship from navigators.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.860]   And so when I became a Christian, obviously I knew that world well.
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.080]   Everybody that I knew was from that charismatic camp, and the people that I looked up to.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.440]   So my faith started within that camp.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.440]   But after about four or five years of being in that ministry, there were certain things
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.600]   that I noticed that I couldn't reconcile with what I was reading in Scripture.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.720]   And so I began to ask them questions.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.080]   "Well, you know, this pastor says this.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.120]   Why do we practice this way?
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.120]   This pastor says that.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.560]   Why do we practice that way?"
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.000]   And so the answers that I was getting was not satisfactory, because the typical answer
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.880]   would be, "Peter, you're a troublemaker.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.880]   Just accept it.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.720]   It doesn't bother anybody."
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.960]   And so it was kind of brushed under.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.160]   And so for a while, you know, I lived with, "They're more mature than me.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   They pray more than I do.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.400]   Obviously, they studied more than I do."
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.540]   And this is, I was, what, 23 years old at that time, 22, 23.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.120]   And so as I was wrestling with this, after years of trying to find out, "What does the
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.400]   Bible say and how do we apply this?"
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.800]   Because I was already a Bible major in undergrad, and I was entering into seminary.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:53.000]   And I came to the conclusion that I can't just put my confidence in these leaders, because
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.740]   historically the leadership, in certain periods of time, have made very poor decisions.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.200]   You and I are called Protestants because people protested what the church was doing.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.880]   And the answer that was given to them is that, "Well, trust us.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.120]   We know the Bible.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   The Pope knows the Bible.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.360]   They're closer to God than you are."
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.200]   And so we are called Protestants because we protested, we tested everything by the Word
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.140]   of God.
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.600]   And so I came to the conclusion, as difficult as it was, because these were my leaders.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.040]   These are the people that I respected.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.880]   They're the ones who influenced my spiritual life more than anybody else, at least as a
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.560]   Christian.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.880]   But once I made that decision, I knew the ramification of that, that all my friends
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.640]   that was in that ministry, all the people that I looked up to, people that I gained
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.080]   counsel from, people who loved me and I loved back, and I respected, that I would end up
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.720]   having to leave that and then just walk out into a place where I knew that I was just
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.600]   going to be on my own.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.200]   But I could not reconcile what I was seeing with Scripture with what was being practiced.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   So I made that decision.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   I broke off.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.960]   And again, you know, and that's why even to this day, you know, our church name is
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.760]   Berean Community Church because they tested everything that Apostle Paul said.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:16.300]   And so the reason why I share this is if there was any time in human history where bad doctrine
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.200]   can penetrate into the church so quickly, it's today.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   We have a generation of people, we're not just talking about, you know, where we are
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:33.400]   at, but just all across the board, where biblical illiteracy is so high that almost anything
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.200]   that is said up in the pulpit is not being filtered by Scripture, but by the individual's
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.200]   moral compass.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   Does that seem right?
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   Does that seem fair?
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.020]   Does that seem like what Jesus would say?
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.440]   And based on that, it would come in or out.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.440]   See, in Matthew 24, 23, it says, "For false Christs and false prophets will arise and
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.960]   will show great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect."
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.880]   He says that the greatest destruction of the church, the temptation of the church, is going
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.080]   to come through people who are claiming to be speaking for God.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.960]   And then he says, "The delusion is going to be so great that even the elect, if possible,"
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.400]   meaning that if you're truly elect, right, you would not be caught up in this, but what
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.560]   he is describing is a mass exodus in the church who we thought for sure they were Christians,
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.760]   but because of this delusional teaching of these false prophets, he said many are going
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.920]   to be dropping out.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.960]   If there's any period of time where the church is prepared for that, where we've laid the
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.280]   foundation where this can easily happen is today.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.240]   Before you'd have to have a seminary degree, have some sort of filter to get on the pulpit,
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.200]   and then even if there's bad teaching, it would usually be limited to that church or
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.080]   the influence that they are able to have physically.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.520]   Today you can get on the internet, start a blog, or you can do some video, whatever,
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.520]   and you don't know who this person is, but if they have a large following, 100,000, 200,000,
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.640]   whatever they say is being absorbed by the new generation of Christians without being
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.160]   able to test, is that really true?
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.440]   So if you have enough people with influence, enough people who are popular, repeat these
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.080]   statements, the only filter that they have is, "I think that's true.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.120]   I like this, and I don't like this."
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.240]   And so again, we are in a very dangerous time when bad doctrine can just come in and not
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.080]   just spoil one church, but immediately spoil the whole church almost instantaneously.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.680]   So if there's any period in time where the church needs to cling to the Word of God and
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.600]   is able to test what is coming off of not just this pulpit, but any pulpit, it is today.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.200]   In Jeremiah 23, 21 it says, "I did not send these prophets, but they ran.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.480]   I did not speak to them, but they prophesied."
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:08.120]   One of the biggest problems that we have in our generation is a typical way that somebody
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.640]   would come into ministry and get a pulpit to have an audience is you just have to want
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.520]   it.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.960]   Whatever the motivation is, whatever your desire is, no matter what your life looks
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.040]   like, no matter what kind of character that you have, if you desire it and you choose
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:29.440]   to go to seminary, and then once you go to seminary, you are a pastor.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.080]   You'll find some church somewhere to give you a pulpit to preach on, almost anywhere.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.600]   It doesn't matter what kind of background it is because there is almost no filter.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.120]   Once you get into the pulpit and you get that title, you have the same authority as anybody
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.440]   else.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.320]   You have the same authority to be able to say, "This is what the Word of God says because
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.560]   I went to seminary, because I have a pulpit.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.200]   I'm called a pastor."
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.080]   And so now, because of the internet, that individual has an audience.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.880]   If he is talented enough, if he's gifted enough, and if he has enough following, all
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:06.560]   of a sudden he can influence not only his church, but nationally, maybe even internationally.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:16.280]   So the groundwork has been set for the Antichrist to have its greatest impact in our generation.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.160]   Jeremiah 23, 36, it says, "For you will no longer remember the oracle of the Lord, because
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:26.920]   every man's own word will become the oracle."
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.680]   God warns us, even in the time of Jeremiah, when people are coming and saying, "Thus saith
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.240]   the Lord," but they're actually repeating their own thoughts, their own words.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.240]   And you have perverted the words of the living God, the Lord of hosts, our God.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.160]   You know, I usually don't do this.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.760]   I usually don't do this because I don't want to get political.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.040]   You know, that's not the point of a Sunday sermon.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.080]   Sunday sermon is I want to teach the Word of God plainly, and then let you apply it
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.440]   the way God convicts you, according to what the Word of God says.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.800]   But I want to give you a quote from a man who has been the head of Southern Baptist
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.120]   Convention.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.920]   And I know this is going to disturb some people, but I feel that necessary, and I'll explain
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.040]   to you why I'm doing this.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:18.280]   J.D. Greer has been the president of Southern Baptist Convention for several years, and
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:24.600]   he said this in the context of a sermon.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.080]   And I want to read you this quote, and I want to tell you what the reason why I'm quoting
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.080]   this to you.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.520]   J.D. Greer says, "We ought to whisper about what the Bible whispers about, and we ought
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.920]   to shout about what the Bible shouts about."
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.400]   Up to that point, 100% agreement.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.560]   We need to be faithful to the Word of God.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.120]   Every preacher who's up in the pulpit will be judged according to how well he represents
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.120]   the Word of God.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.120]   So what he says is true.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:56.080]   And then he says, and this is the part that shook up a lot of people, "Bible appears more
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.240]   to whisper when it comes to sexual sin, compared to it shouts about materialism and religious
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.920]   pride."
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.880]   The reason why I share this with you is because most false doctrine comes in to the church
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.160]   in this manner, through people who are influential.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.660]   Now what part of this is a problem?
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.400]   The second part is not the problem when he says he shouts about materialism and religious
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.240]   pride, because the Bible does shout about materialism and religious pride.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.160]   The part that was controversial was, but he whispers when it comes to sexual sin.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.740]   Now why did he say this?
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.560]   He said this in the context of trying to get people who are voting for Trump not to vote
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.560]   for him.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:47.960]   Because he said that we're choosing a political party based upon our desire, because the Democratic
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:53.840]   Party was pushing the agenda that sexuality is going to be equated with, whether you're
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.080]   homosexual or transgender, it's going to be equated with a people group.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:03.000]   So therefore, if you discriminate, even as a church, if you discriminate and you don't
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.880]   hire a homosexual, that they want to pass laws where your non-private status will be
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.880]   taken away, you'll be fine.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.760]   You'll be treated like if we said we're renting a property and we won't give it to the black
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.280]   community or the Hispanic community.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.200]   You'll be treated with the same kind of standard that you would for sexual preference, as they
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.840]   say.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.200]   And so he's saying, what he's saying is not, "I'm okay with that."
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:35.320]   He's saying that the Bible whispers about sexual immorality, but it screams about the
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.520]   things that the Democratic Party is pushing.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.840]   Now, the point of my sermon today is not to tell you, I am a Republican, I'm a proud Republican,
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.240]   but I'm not here to preach about politics.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.880]   What I'm trying to preach to you about is the word of God.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:57.320]   When I first read this, my first reaction was, "Are we even reading the same Bible?"
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:02.960]   And this is the common response that I got from most of my friends who, no matter what
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.920]   political party they are in, who are into the word of God, is, "Are we reading the same
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.920]   Bible?
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.200]   How can this come out of somebody who's this influential?"
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:18.280]   And 1 Peter 2.11 says, "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.880]   lusts, pornea, which wage war against the soul."
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.160]   Wages war against the soul.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.720]   That does not sound like a whisper.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.160]   First Corinthians 6.18, "Flee immorality."
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.480]   The word in Greek is pornea, where some of your Bible translation is sexual immorality.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.920]   Flee, not to fight it, not have discussions about it.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.800]   He says to flee.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.660]   Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body.
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.760]   You see how he elevates sexual immorality with every other sin?
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.040]   That doesn't sound like a whisper.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.320]   Every other sin that commits is outside the body.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.520]   The immoral man, sexually immoral man, sins against his own body.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.320]   First Thessalonians 4.3, "You struggle with what is the will of God?"
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.760]   He said, "Well, here's the will of God, for this is the will of God, your sanctification.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.360]   That is that you abstain from sexual immorality."
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.000]   Now, test me.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.240]   You say, "Oh, he picked four verses, three verses in the context to try to make his point."
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.600]   How will you know if what I'm saying is true or not?
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.920]   If you don't have the word of God, you won't.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.360]   So truth will depend on how good of a job I do presenting today.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.680]   So if I'm articulate, tell you some funny stories, and then I say some nice things that
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:39.960]   maybe you already agree, and you'll leave this room thinking like, "Yes, it's confirmed."
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.080]   Or maybe you came into this room with a different bent.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.480]   So our church is too conservative, and I think those things are right, and then what I'm
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.600]   saying is like, "Oh, you're just picking it out of context."
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:56.060]   But you don't have the ability to filter if it's true or not, because you're not testing
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.080]   it with the word of God.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.640]   You're testing it with your own moral center.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.840]   That sounds good to me.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.340]   That doesn't sound right to me.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.960]   So everything that bothers me and everything that I accept is already determined by what
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.640]   we brought into this room.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.720]   Instead of testing it and filtering it and allow the word of God to test the thoughts
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:21.280]   and intentions of my heart, and if things that I am thinking and applying is not biblical,
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.640]   we are to change, not the word of God.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:30.880]   And the reason, again, why I say it and I even attach his name to it is because this
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.640]   is how the church gets corrupted.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:42.600]   This is how a generation of people who are not filtering what is true with the word will
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:49.000]   easily think that this is what the Bible says, and they will quote this quote.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.900]   They will quote him and other people who say things like that without actually knowing
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.400]   what the Bible says and say, "Bible says."
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.400]   The Bible says this.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.620]   The Bible says that.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.720]   But they're not quoting scripture.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:06.680]   They're quoting a man who says he's quoting scripture, but he's not quoting scripture.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.040]   That's not what the Bible says.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.640]   The Bible does not whisper when it comes to sexual immorality.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.640]   It screams.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.840]   In fact, it is one of the loudest screams that you will see in the Bible.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.960]   In Joshua 1.8, it says, "This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.240]   you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.920]   all that is written in it, for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.760]   have success."
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.760]   That's the text.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.160]   That's the commandment that was given to Joshua and the Israelites as they are going into
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.140]   the promised land to establish a new covenant community.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.480]   So this new community that you're going to build, he gave one instruction.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:49.320]   He said, "Get together, get all the smartest guys and figure out how you're going to do
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.680]   finances and politics and make decisions."
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.680]   None of that.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.820]   He just says, "All the commandments I gave to you, the ones you understand, the ones
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.760]   you don't understand, meditate on it day and night, and do according to exactly as I told
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.400]   you if you want to have success."
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.280]   Now what does this have to do with Hebrews 12.14?
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.920]   If you look at this text in Hebrews 14, it says, "Pursue peace with all men and the sanctification
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.920]   without which no one will see the Lord."
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.120]   Whenever we look at a text, we have to read it critically.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.560]   Just that this is the reason why we do inductive Bible study, that we don't just prepare and
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.560]   I tell you, "Hey, this is what the Word of God says.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.920]   Trust me.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.920]   I said it.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.860]   I quoted a verse, so it must be true."
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.720]   We want you to be able to ask critical questions and test me.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.120]   And I tell you all the time, don't trust it because I said it.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.120]   Test me.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.520]   If what I said is not biblical, you should have the boldness to come and say, "How did
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.400]   you get that from that text?"
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.600]   This is one of those texts that can easily look at it and say, "Pursue peace with all
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.440]   men."
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:17:01.200]   And so without thinking, without asking questions, we can apply that and say, "What I did was
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:07.160]   wrong because I just quoted JD and I just called him out and I said that's wrong."
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.560]   That doesn't sound like a man who's pursuing peace.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.560]   You just started war.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.320]   I mean, he doesn't have no idea who I am, you know what I mean?
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.000]   So I don't think it's going to ever escalate, but maybe some of you are fans of JD Greer
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   and you say, "Hey, you just stirred things up."
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:29.080]   You sound like a man who is not pursuing peace.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.600]   If we want to understand and apply what the Word of God says, we have to ask these critical
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.060]   questions.
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.120]   What does this mean?
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.920]   So I have some questions.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:44.080]   Does this mean that we need to jot down everyone we have a relational issue with and reconcile
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.520]   with them or we won't be able to see God?
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.080]   We won't be saved.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:57.360]   If that's the case, how did Jesus reconcile with his enemies before he went to the cross?
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.200]   If this is to commandment, the letter of the law is to find that you should never have
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:07.520]   any contention with anybody for any reason and you need to either reconcile with them
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.320]   or else you're not going to see God.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.360]   You're not going to be saved.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:17.120]   How did Paul reconcile with the Judaizers during his ministry before he was beheaded?
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.760]   How did that happen?
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.400]   Does this mean that if we keep struggling with certain sins that you won't be saved?
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.320]   He said without sanctification and the word sanctification just literally means holiness.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.760]   So without a pursuit of peace with all men, without pursuit or holiness, you're not going
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.400]   to be saved.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.080]   Clearly that can't be because we know that salvation is by grace.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.680]   There's too many passages that we'd have to write off to say that.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.400]   Then what does this mean?
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.040]   And what does it mean to see God?
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.400]   Again, the reason why I ask you to ask these critical questions and don't just kind of
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:19:00.680]   digest what I say without filter is if you just digest what I say without filtering,
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.820]   you're going to remember the stories that I tell you.
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:08.640]   And all your theology is going to come through whether you like that story or not.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.160]   Whether I was funny or articulate or whether I scratched your ears and you say, "Ah, I
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.160]   like that."
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.160]   You know.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.040]   And so we have a generation filled with people who are living by cliches.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.560]   One saved, always saved.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.560]   Christian's not perfect, just forgiven.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.220]   And you have these cliches that you've memorized through the years and all your theology comes
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.360]   through the cliches.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.440]   You have to test to see what does the word of God say?
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:41.500]   Now the interpretation of this passage, usually if you read the commentaries or you hear sermons
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.780]   about this text, it'll go two directions.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:50.140]   The first direction is to pursue peace with all men, meaning that we have to make sure
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:55.160]   that we have peace with everybody, at least to the best of your ability, if you're reasonable.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.920]   You're not going to make peace with a Taliban.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.480]   You're not going to make peace with certain people you don't even have access to them.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.120]   You're not going to make peace with somebody that you knew 20 years ago.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.720]   You're not going to go find all of them out.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.760]   As far as it depends on you, it says in the book of Romans.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.460]   So you have that route where he says actually pursue the peace.
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:19.640]   And then the other route is to pursue peace, pursue the peace together with everyone.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:24.040]   And that peace he's referring to is the peace that we can only have through the blood of
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.720]   Jesus Christ.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.360]   So you will have one or the other.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:35.040]   My conclusion from this text and from the context of the book of Hebrews, the primary
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:40.200]   meaning is both.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.200]   The primary because you can't have one without the other.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.520]   You can't have peace with mankind unless you have peace with God.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:52.580]   But the priority is you must have peace with God first.
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.240]   And that was the whole point of the book of Hebrews, wasn't it?
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.600]   The whole point of the book of Hebrews was they were drifting.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.360]   They were drifting away, neglecting their salvation.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.840]   And the way to get them back is to fix your eyes upon Jesus.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:11.760]   And so we have 10 chapters of Christology, how Jesus is better than the sacrifice, better
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.280]   than the high priest, better than the angel, better than Moses, better than the high priest.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.780]   And so he was bringing their attention back to Christ so that they would not drift from
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.740]   this great salvation.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.080]   So within that context, what he's saying in Hebrews chapter 12 is what he started in the
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:32.680]   beginning to fix your eyes upon Jesus, to fix your eyes upon Jesus.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.720]   And what he says in the rest of chapter 12 and 13 is really a revelation of what that
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.240]   looks like.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:43.840]   And that's why we looked at last week that to make your path straight is primarily, first
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:50.760]   and foremost, the imagery is to have the straight path to the cities of refuge, which is Christ.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:59.740]   See, even the word for shalom, the first century Jew, the idea of peace, right?
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.560]   You know what shalom means, peace, was so important that they used that as a primary
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.560]   greeting.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.640]   Shalom, when they met each other, and then they said shalom when they were leaving.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.600]   The biblical definition of shalom says this.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:18.200]   Shalom is a Hebrew word meaning peace, harmony, completeness, prosperity, welfare, and tranquility
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.500]   to be made whole by God.
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:27.920]   So to a Jew, there was a very specific understanding of this term peace.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:34.200]   In fact, their primary pursuit of their nation is peace.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.440]   Because they were saying this to one another.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.360]   One day we're going to have peace when the Messiah comes.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.360]   We're going to have peace.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.880]   Peace to you, peace to you.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.920]   May God make you whole in all things.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.180]   Whatever was lost because of our sins, may God make you whole.
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.720]   That was what shalom meant.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.480]   And this is why when Jesus was coming into Jerusalem, the problem wasn't that they weren't
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.280]   pursuing peace, but they were pursuing peace in the wrong place.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.720]   And that's why Jesus weeps over Jerusalem and says, "Only today if you knew what would
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.220]   truly bring you peace, then destruction would not be coming upon you."
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:13.600]   So the problem was not that they were not pursuing peace, but they didn't understand
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.060]   that Christ came ultimately to bring them spiritual peace.
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:23.520]   To recreate and regenerate what was lost at the fall.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:30.600]   In Genesis chapter 3, 14 to 19, it is a description of the ramification of sin that came into
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.800]   mankind.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:38.040]   So the first part in verse 14 to 15 is the punishment for the serpent.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:42.640]   It says, "The Lord God said to the serpent, 'Because you have done this, cursed are you
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.120]   more than all the cattle and more than every beast of the field.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.240]   On your belly you will go, and dust you will eat all the days of your life.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.660]   And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:00.720]   He shall bruise you on the head, and you shall bruise him on the heel.'"
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:06.280]   So the first description of the fall of mankind is that the serpent is going to be in this
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.440]   contention with the seed of the woman and all of their followers.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:16.760]   That's why the Bible describes our enemy, the serpent, as a devil who's like a roaring
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.300]   lion seeking someone to devour.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:28.840]   And that's why Paul says in the book of Ephesians that we are in spiritual warfare.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:37.960]   All of mankind, all of human history since the fall has been under this constant battle
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:44.200]   between Satan wanting to destroy the worshipers of Christ and Christ himself.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:50.760]   And so you and I may feel peaceful at times because we're not at war, because our bills
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:56.740]   are paid, we have a good marriage, and our kids are obedient, and you may feel at peace.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:02.640]   But whatever we feel peaceful at at that time is no different than two soldiers in a foxhole
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.200]   in the middle of a war enjoying their coffee.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.100]   They feel peaceful.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.780]   They feel safe because they're in their foxhole.
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:14.780]   But it's in the context of a war that is raging around them.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.900]   That's how the Bible describes the history of mankind, our experience.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.100]   And every once in a while something reminds us that this world is under God's condemnation.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.740]   It's, "Oh my God, why would God do something like that?
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.760]   Why would a loving God do something like that?"
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.920]   The Bible actually describes all of mankind to be under that.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.820]   So it is moments of peace when you and I experience this foxhole.
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:39.300]   That's when we should be asking, "What is going on?"
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.700]   Because that Bible describes it that way.
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:46.640]   Verse 16, "The fall of woman to the woman, he said, I will greatly multiply your pain
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.980]   in childbirth.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.980]   In pain you will bring forth children, yet your desire will be for your husband, and
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.260]   he will rule over you."
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:01.060]   If you notice verse 16, everything about verse 16 is exactly why God created Eve.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.680]   God created Eve because he said it was not good for Adam to be alone.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.140]   It wasn't saying that there was something morally defective about Adam.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:13.100]   He was saying that he couldn't carry out God's mandate by himself because God didn't make
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.880]   him asexual.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:22.260]   So he created Eve so that Adam and Eve can be fruitful and multiply.
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:28.140]   And to create her so that she may be a suitable helper so that he can fulfill the creation
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.760]   mandate.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.660]   So if you look at what he says, he says, "You will have children, but how will you have
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.140]   children, in pain."
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.140]   In pain.
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.920]   You will have a relationship with your husband, but he says your desire will be for your husband.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:48.660]   And the word for desire here in Hebrew has an idea of conflict.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:55.200]   So you're going to fulfill why God created you, but you're not going to have peace.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.000]   There's going to be pain in childbearing.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.980]   There's going to be pain in raising these sinners in the sinful world.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:07.280]   And then there's going to be contention between husband and wife.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:13.120]   If you ask most people where the greatest pain that they have experienced in life came
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:19.960]   from, majority of people, not 100%, majority of people will say it was from their home.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.560]   Whether it was from the father, it was from the mother, it was the marriage, it was with
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.560]   the relationship.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:30.080]   Majority of people who live on this earth have experienced what it's like to live with
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.440]   this contention.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.520]   So peace was gone.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.560]   Peace was gone in human history.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.560]   Peace was gone in the home.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.760]   And then in verse 17, to Adam, he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:45.520]   and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.520]   from it.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.960]   Cursed is the ground because of you.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.840]   In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:57.240]   You will do what I commanded you to do, but there will be no peace.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:02.720]   Thorns and thistles, it shall grow for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.040]   By the sweat of your face you will eat bread, till you return to the ground, because from
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.880]   it you were taken, for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:16.400]   I created you so that you may be fruitful and multiply, and so that you may subdue the
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.940]   land, take care of the land that I created.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.640]   You will continue to be fruitful in that way.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:26.280]   You will continue to do the work, but it will create thorns and thistles."
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:32.760]   Now, those of you who are in college who are eager to get a job, there's a reason why all
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.840]   the songs are about weekends.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:44.120]   When's the last time you heard "Monday, so eager for Monday"?
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.800]   There's no song.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.720]   Everything's about Friday or the weekend.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:57.520]   There's no songs about Monday because there's no joy on Monday.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.160]   They call Wednesday "Hump Day" because you're closer.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.640]   You got through the hump so you can get to the weekend.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.760]   The Bible says God created them, so what has left?
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.000]   They're doing what God created them to do, but what's left?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.600]   Peace is gone.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.880]   That's why the Bible describes the seventh day as what?
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.880]   The Sabbath.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.440]   Sabbath is another word for what?
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.840]   Peace, rest.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.880]   After he created all things, he went into the Sabbath and he brought everyone into the
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.440]   Sabbath with him, but when they broke God's commandment, the Sabbath was broken.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:41.280]   That's why all throughout Scripture, in the Old Testament, why the Sabbath, why keeping
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:48.560]   this day was so important in the law because that was pointing to the salvation of mankind,
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:53.920]   that when Christ comes, that's what he's going to restore.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:59.320]   Without Christ's Sabbath, there is no peace.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:05.680]   Until we come into the Sabbath of Christ, we can pretend to have peace with one another,
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.760]   but there is no true peace.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:13.160]   In Isaiah 9, 6, the prophecy about the coming of the Messiah, he says he's called the wonderful
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.440]   counselor, mighty God, eternal father, prince of peace.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:24.560]   Ephesians 2, 14, verse 17, it says, "For he himself is our peace, who made both groups
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.760]   into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall."
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.800]   He is our peace.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:35.360]   "And he came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.360]   near.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.520]   For through him we both have our access in one spirit to the Father."
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.320]   And again, Romans 5, 1, "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.600]   God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:55.200]   You notice how righteousness, holiness, and peace are put together.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.600]   It was meant to be put together because you cannot have peace until there is righteousness
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.560]   in Christ.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:07.080]   So that's why he says, without pursuing peace, without pursuing righteousness, you cannot
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.080]   see God.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:16.360]   So it is only when we are imputed by his righteousness and our relationship with God, with him is
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.960]   restored, can we have true peace.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:26.040]   And only then can you truly practice peace with one another.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:30.480]   Until there is peace within, there is no peace without.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:36.960]   We cannot artificially make peace when we are not in peace with God.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.960]   Because what's causing this anxiety, what's causing this misunderstanding, what's causing
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:47.360]   these conflicts, was a direct result of being separated from the Prince of Peace.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.980]   So the priority is, is pursuing peace with God.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:58.640]   And when that happens, he will command us to have peace with one another.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:05.160]   You know, the world has been trying so hard to bring reconciliation, especially in the
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:12.840]   last year and a half, with all the turmoil of racial injustices and equity.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.240]   And so we need to have peace.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:18.000]   In fact, oftentimes nations go to war.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.520]   The only way that we can have true peace is to have war so that we can suppress the people
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.520]   who are impeding our peace.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.080]   So we need to get rid of them.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.720]   But the problem with that is the other side thinks the same thing of us.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.800]   In order for them to have peace, we need to die.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.360]   And usually that's how wars happen.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:42.840]   In the last year and a half, $1.7 billion have been dedicated to racial reconciliation.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.080]   $1.7 billion from the corporations.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:51.960]   $250 million was dedicated by the NBA to tackle this racial reconciliation so that we can
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.840]   have peace.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:00.040]   Billions were collected by the Black Lives Matter movement, all in the hopes of bringing
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.520]   peace.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:09.840]   They said that the donations for this cause has gone up 15 times just in the last year.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.760]   And I'm only talking about the private sector.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:17.120]   All of this pales in comparison to the money that the government is pouring in, in order
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.120]   to bring peace.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:25.480]   Now let me ask you, honestly, have you seen the effects of this money?
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.760]   Are we at more peace?
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.120]   Are people getting along better because of this?
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:35.360]   I mean, you may have different opinions, but my honest opinion is it's gotten much worse.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.640]   Now, I feel bad for our Caucasian brothers and sisters in this generation.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.080]   I can't imagine every time you turn on TV or radio, get online and somebody's calling
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.040]   you a racist.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:53.520]   It's almost like you want to become racist.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:59.280]   I think there's more true white supremacy today as a result of their efforts to bring
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.240]   reconciliation, to bring peace.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.760]   Let me give you an example.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.920]   When we were younger, I have an older brother and younger brother, and so we would get into
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.920]   fights.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:18.200]   And this is before online gaming and TV, and so we had nothing else to do, so we wrestled.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.640]   I think all three of us could have been professional wrestlers at some point because this was our
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.480]   pastime 24/7.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.160]   And then we would get into fights, we would wrestle.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:30.000]   So usually the way that my dad would discipline us when we would get into fights was he would
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.720]   have us sit together, face each other, whoever was fighting.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.840]   I would say 9 out of 10 times it was me and Philip.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.840]   Paul was too big, right?
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.300]   It usually wasn't a fight.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:47.160]   But Philip and I, we were the same size most of our life, and then he outgrew me at some
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.960]   point.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.000]   But we would get into fights, and the way that my dad would deal with it, he would sit
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.880]   and have us next to each other, and he would give us a lecture how you shouldn't fight,
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.580]   but if you're going to fight, you should do it this way.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:04.680]   So he would have us sit together, and then he said, "You slap your brother, and then
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.000]   you get to slap him."
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.640]   And then you do it like three or four times, and then that's it.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.080]   You got it out of your system.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:20.960]   So both of us were kind of hesitating who would go first, and then I said, "Okay."
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.400]   Then in my mind, I was like, "I'll tap him like this."
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.880]   I don't want to hit him too hard.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.880]   My dad's there.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.800]   If we were alone, it'd be a different story, but my dad's sitting there, so I have to,
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.260]   "Okay, tap him."
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.760]   He would hear that, see that tapping, and he said, "Oh, that was harder than what he
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.240]   was expecting."
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.520]   So now he's upset.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.480]   So he slaps me a little bit harder.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.800]   Oh, I pulled back.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.440]   He didn't pull back.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.160]   And then it's my turn.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.160]   Boom.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:57.520]   And now he's full blown, and now my dad's concerned, because I slapped him, and then
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.520]   now he's got to retaliate.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.660]   So he comes back clapping, and then so now we're just slapping each other.
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.700]   So my dad has to stop it, and he's, "Stop!
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.760]   It didn't work."
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.800]   I don't remember a single time where that worked.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:16.600]   And the reason why it didn't work is because both of us have our own definition of what
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.120]   was just.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.880]   And this is the reason why marriages are not 50%.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.960]   You don't come into marriage saying, "You give 50, I give 50."
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:34.440]   It sounds great, but the problem is there's never any agreement at where that 50% is.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.320]   So the wife thinks that she's giving 70, he's only giving 30.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.720]   And the husband thinks that he's giving 70, and she's giving 30.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:47.160]   So eventually she gets frustrated, and she says, "Is there something wrong?"
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.160]   "Huh?
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.760]   Oh, you said amen?
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.760]   Okay.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.760]   This is why I'm preaching.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.760]   Listen."
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.760]   Eventually what ends up happening is that the wife gets frustrated and said, "Well,
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.520]   I've been giving 70, you give me 30.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:05.760]   I'm going to pull back and give you 60, because you're not doing your part."
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.040]   And the husband sees that and says, "I've been giving 70, you gave me 30, now you're
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.040]   giving me 20.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.880]   So now I'm going to pull back, and so he's going to give 60."
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.640]   And then they get frustrated.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.840]   Now you get escalated, and eventually it's like, "I'm not going to give you any."
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:25.080]   And that's usually how it works, because they can't come to an agreement where the
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.520]   middle is.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.640]   That's why whenever there's a marriage, the calling for husband and wife is an example
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.400]   of Christ who gave sacrificially 100%.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.760]   You didn't deserve it.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.480]   That's what a covenant relationship is.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:44.240]   You commit to give to an individual who doesn't deserve what they're getting, what I'm
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.560]   going to give to them.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:50.620]   It is 100% commitment, and the wife is called to honor and to submit 100%, whether he looks
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.400]   like Christ or not.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:58.720]   So it is a covenant relationship where 100% come together, motivated, not because he's
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.880]   such a great guy, not because she's such a great wife, but because of what Christ has
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:10.100]   done for us, because the Prince of Peace gave us what you and I did not deserve.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:18.400]   So until there is peace with Christ, the world's idea of reconciliation only causes more war,
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:23.000]   more contention, more bitterness, because how do you come to peace with somebody that
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.360]   is not in agreement as to where the middle is?
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.660]   What is just?
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:33.440]   Until Christ is at the center, there is no reconciliation.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:38.260]   That's why in 1 Corinthians 1.10 it says, "Now I exhort you, brethren, by name of our
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:44.040]   Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no division among you."
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.040]   Think about that.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.440]   It sounds beautiful on paper.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:55.280]   Have you known anybody, even with your wife, that you have a covenant relationship with,
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.920]   that you have 100% agreement?
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.920]   I agree everything.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:05.120]   Food, where to eat, how to spend money, how to raise children, where to buy the house,
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.120]   how much money.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.860]   How do you get 100% agreement?
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.220]   And how do you get 100% agreement with everybody?
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.380]   Is that what he is saying?
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.800]   Is that what we are called to do?
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:20.600]   To be smart and figure out how we're going to all come together so everybody is in agreement?
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.280]   I've never seen it.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.500]   Even in the best of marriages, I've never seen it.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.340]   Even in the best of churches, I've never seen it.
[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:35.840]   He's not referring to the hard work that causes us to find the middle and to be reconciled
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.260]   to one another.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:43.600]   He's telling us to pursue Christ, our peace, with all our might.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.760]   Ephesians 4, 1-6, "Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.840]   worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness,
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:40:00.480]   with patience, showing tolerance for one another, in love, being diligent to preserve the unity
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.600]   of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.800]   Let me stop right there.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.400]   What does he say?
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:11.760]   Preserve the peace that you have.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.920]   Preserve the peace that you already have.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:20.520]   Because we have one body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:26.560]   God in the Father, who is over all and through all and in all.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:31.920]   The only way that you and I can unite together and to have peace with one another is to have
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.320]   peace with God in His righteousness.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.760]   And the only agreement that you and I will ever have together is the one who never changes.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.320]   There is no variation.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.260]   There is no prejudice in Him.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.000]   He does not change the Word of God.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.080]   Nothing like grass will wither, but the Word of God will stand forever.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:59.380]   And the only way that you and I will have this agreement is to get to the Word of God
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:04.760]   and to agree with the Word of God and to preach the Word of God, to filter through the Word
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.320]   of God, to apply the Word of God.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.100]   This is not a pet choice of our church.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:18.600]   This is the only way that you and I will stand through the trials that are here and are coming.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:30.200]   Biblical understanding of peace is not not fighting.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.760]   That's not the biblical understanding of peace.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:39.480]   The biblical understanding of peace at all costs to preserve Christ.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.440]   At all costs, preserve Christ.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.520]   It is the world's definition of peace.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:51.680]   No fighting, enjoy your coffee in the middle of war, as long as nobody is yelling, as long
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.840]   as nobody is screaming, as long as everybody loves one another, we're at peace.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.960]   While people are dying because they do not know Christ, while the church is being corrupted
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:07.400]   by false teachings left and right, that is not the biblical understanding of peace.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:14.900]   When He says to pursue peace, to pursue righteousness, or no one will see God, it is a call to every
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:21.800]   believer to fight for the gospel, to preserve Christ at the middle at all costs.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:30.140]   So my encouragement to every single one of you, get into the Word.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.140]   Get into the Word.
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.140]   Don't trust.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.920]   I mean, everything I said today could be a lie.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.600]   Everything I said could have been made up.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.440]   "Ah, Pastor Peter is conservative and, you know, he said he's a Republican, so that's
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.600]   why he's preaching this and he's doing this and that."
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.900]   Maybe you're right.
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:52.420]   Maybe you're right, but you would never know until you get into the Word.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.540]   Test me.
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:55.540]   Test me.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:43:03.060]   And I ask you to test me because my foundation is the Word of God, and I have confidence.
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:10.780]   So in these last days, as we have been warned, don't be caught off like the rest of the world,
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:15.900]   like the thief in the night that's breaking in to destroy everything that we have.
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:21.220]   We don't know exactly what time he is coming, but he told us to stay sober.
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.480]   Stay sober.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.120]   Get into the Word of God.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.900]   Test everything.
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:26.900]   Don't quote people.
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.620]   Quote the Word of God.
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:33.620]   Let's pray.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:38.300]   Again, take some time to pray.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:43.860]   Let the Word of God not only be in your mind.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:46.280]   Let it meditate.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.980]   Let it saturate your hearts and then your lives.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:55.220]   Anything that you've heard from God's Word has any conviction in your heart.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:44:01.420]   Take some time to ask God, "Lord, I believe, help my unbelief, and that your Word would
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:05.900]   judge the thoughts and intentions of my heart, that I would not simply be hearers of the
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:06.900]   Word, but to be doers."
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.700]   Let's take some time to pray again as our worship team needs us.
