[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   (crowd chattering)
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:14.640]   All right.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.840]   Again, we apologize if the tables got moved around
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.800]   a little bit, it's because we had lunch
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.160]   and then we set it up, and I think this is better anyway.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.000]   It gives you a little bit more space
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.880]   so that you're not sitting back to back with somebody.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.560]   So instead of having seven tables,
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.640]   there's six tables per row,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.800]   and that's why we have extra tables in the back.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.680]   So most likely, I asked you to look at the table
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.480]   that you're in now and try to stay within that table.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.160]   Last week wasn't the final one, this is it, okay?
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.120]   So whatever table you are in now,
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.240]   please stick to that table, okay?
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.440]   So that next week when we come around,
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.360]   you don't have to come and look,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.160]   you can just come straight and sit down, okay?
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.560]   All right, today we're gonna be talking about,
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.040]   again, the third part,
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.400]   when we're talking about God-centered worship,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.640]   and we talked about the holiness of God.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.320]   So first week, we talked about God's nature of holiness
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.200]   and the importance of that as a foundation
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.160]   for understanding everything that we know.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.920]   Pastor Mark talked about Leviticus
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.200]   and how in reflection of his holiness,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.080]   how that affects our view of ourselves
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.200]   and where we stand before God.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.800]   So he went through the book of Leviticus
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.440]   in highlighting God's teaching
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.880]   through the tabernacle, through the sacrifices,
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.240]   and how that reveals where we stand before him.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.860]   So we talked about that last week.
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.200]   Today's session, we're gonna be talking about
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.840]   the ramification of that in the life,
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.820]   individual life and in the corporate life.
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.800]   Because we're, again, gathered together as a church,
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.640]   we're gonna be talking about our church vision,
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.480]   why we practice what we do.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.180]   So the part of PCC is not simply
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.140]   to go over fundamental doctrine,
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.920]   but also to kind of bring the church
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.640]   on the same page as to the philosophies.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.240]   And again, if you've been at our church for a long time,
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.440]   again, all of this stuff is gonna be reviewed to you,
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.240]   but for those of you who are maybe in the last,
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.720]   maybe five or six years that's been here,
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.320]   you probably heard it here and there,
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.580]   but maybe not collectively.
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.480]   But that's the point of what we're gonna be doing today.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.000]   The ramification, how a right view of God
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   affects the way we approach everything that we do at church.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.480]   All right.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.800]   Before we get to that.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.960]   So today, if you look at your handouts,
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.200]   there's a, the way I'm gonna do it is,
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.440]   you're just gonna have to fill out,
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.640]   so the red parts are the parts
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.540]   that you're supposed to fill out.
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.020]   So if you don't have a handout sheet with those open,
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.160]   it's still in the back.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.080]   So the first thing is,
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.680]   our worship must be God-centered and not man-centered.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.720]   So before we even get to that,
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.040]   as an introduction,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.080]   I would say, if there's one particular doctrine
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.480]   that has affected the way I read scripture,
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.440]   the way I view church worship, evangelism,
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.840]   more than any other doctrine,
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.040]   is a doctrine that we've been talking about.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.880]   I remember early on in ministry as a youth pastor,
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.560]   and then an EM pastor at Irvine Baptist.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.160]   I preached topically because that's all I knew how to do.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.480]   That's, you know, that's how I heard the messages,
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.320]   and then out of necessity,
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.360]   I started preaching out of,
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.960]   preaching systematically through the Bible.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.800]   So the first book that I started preaching out of,
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.440]   I think I was a youth pastor when I started,
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.880]   it was the Book of John.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.760]   And then I moved on to Philippians,
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.480]   and then I started teaching Thessalonians,
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.960]   and then after that, it's a blur.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.240]   And I remember doing Romans at some point back then.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.440]   I went through the Romans about three times.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.280]   By the time I got to about three or four books,
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.600]   and going to the fifth book,
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.480]   I began to see a pattern in certain things
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.320]   that I saw in scripture that didn't match
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.120]   how I understood God, how I understood church.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.440]   And the central thing that I started to see
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.800]   was a very, very high view of God.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.600]   His holiness just kept on popping up,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.320]   Old and the New Testament.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.800]   So I decided to give a topical message
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.360]   on this topic of holiness, which I've never given before.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.560]   I've kind of mentioned it before.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.880]   How can you read the Bible without coming across passages
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.440]   where holiness is mentioned?
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.520]   But I decided to give a message,
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.320]   and one particular message on this holiness.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.240]   So I spent several weeks preparing for this.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.160]   And as a result of preparation
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.480]   for this one particular message I was gonna give,
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.680]   it really changed my paradigm.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.240]   And again, I've shared this before
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.920]   with our church many times.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.920]   I was literally shaking as I was preparing
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.640]   that this was central to everything that I knew about God.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.280]   And it caused me to change the way I view church,
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.960]   fellowship, everything.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.600]   So from that moment on,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.000]   it kind of pushed me toward a trajectory,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.400]   the way I understood scripture.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.760]   Again, so when this church was planted,
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.120]   that was the fundamental.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.400]   That was kind of like the foundation
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.920]   upon which we were building everything.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.920]   So I can't emphasize enough that the first two days
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.880]   of teaching in this class,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.200]   if that's just kind of a blur,
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.560]   and you didn't really get the weight
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.080]   of what was taught in the first two classes,
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.400]   then again, everything that we're gonna be teaching
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.080]   is you're gonna get bits and pieces,
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.320]   but you're really not gonna get the weightiness
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   of why it was so important, okay?
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.400]   So again, I wanted to set that as a foundation
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.320]   just to let you know that this is not just one
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.240]   of many things that are important in the church.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.960]   This is the central thing that, again,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.320]   if you know it superficially,
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.800]   or you just kind of passively,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.380]   like, "Oh, I know this," and just kind of dismiss it,
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.720]   it will affect the way you understand scripture
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.820]   and salvation and everything else, okay?
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.160]   First thing that we know is if we understand
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.240]   that God is a holy, holy, holy God,
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.120]   that we were saved from a sin
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.120]   that you and I could not possibly work toward,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.240]   and if we have a proper understanding of God,
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.760]   the first thing that it affects
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.720]   is the way that we worship, right?
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.240]   That's why our very first vision in our church
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.580]   is to establish God-centered worship and not man-centered.
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.620]   Now, that may seem kind of obvious, maybe, to some of you,
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.740]   but I'm gonna explain the difference between the two,
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.100]   when it's not God-centered, when it's man-centered,
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.740]   when, especially in our generation,
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.580]   where market-driven churches, where if you do this
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.260]   and if you tweak the church this way
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.380]   and if you have small groups this way,
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.420]   more people will come and more people
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.860]   will be happy at church.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.120]   First and foremost, if it is a God-centered,
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.860]   God-honoring church, the first question we need to ask
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.480]   is is God honored by doing that, right?
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.500]   So, right worship begins with the right understanding
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.580]   of who God is.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.780]   That's at the center of what we do, right?
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.580]   So, we can't say that we're come to worship God
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.060]   and not know the God that you're worshiping.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.720]   And of the things that we know of who God is,
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.020]   God is not, again, if you have a picture of God
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.580]   as a grandfather that just kinda is okay with sin,
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.500]   if he's kinda like Santa Claus
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.380]   that answers any prayers that you have,
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.220]   then yeah, it's gonna affect the way you understand.
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.720]   There's gonna be a lot of frustration
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.780]   because your foundation is wrong, right?
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.500]   So, first and foremost, our whole purpose of gathering
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.420]   in our personal being is to give God the glory
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.380]   and give him worship.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.860]   So, right understanding of God is at the center of that.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.140]   King David, having a right perspective of God,
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.260]   asked the question, "Why are you so mindful of men?"
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.660]   Modern day, when it's not God-centered,
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.840]   the question we ask is if God is so loving,
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.940]   why does he do this, right?
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.820]   If God cares, why doesn't he prove it?
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.340]   So, we're always like kinda testing God to see,
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.380]   you know, to live up to it.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.740]   If he loves me so much, why doesn't he do this for me?
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.300]   If he loves me so much, why doesn't he answer my prayer?
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.260]   But when we have a proper understanding of who God is,
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.100]   the right question that we ought to be asking
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.780]   every single day is, why does he even care, right?
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.960]   Why does he even care?
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.420]   Who are we and who is God, right?
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.320]   In comparison to knowing who God is,
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.820]   the Bible oftentimes describes us as worm.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.700]   We're just like a mist that comes and goes, right?
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.580]   Only reason why we're precious is because
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.540]   God chose to make us precious.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.500]   But independent of that, I mean,
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.020]   if you really think about it, objectively, who are we?
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.860]   I mean, we're just a mist.
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:42.940]   Why does he even care?
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.460]   So, the greatest question that any sinner
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.300]   who's saved by the grace of God should be asking
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.240]   all the time is, why does he care?
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.180]   Why does he care to send his only begotten son, right?
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.460]   And that should be the foundation upon everything that we do.
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.340]   That's the beginning point of true worship.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.660]   I don't understand why he did what he did for me,
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.060]   but the scripture says he did it and I believe in it,
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.700]   I accept it, and therefore I worship him, right?
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.300]   So, from that moment on, even if you're homeless and sick
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.140]   and hungry for the rest of your lives,
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.820]   you have salvation, correct?
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.420]   So, our worship should not be contingent upon
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.740]   your bills being paid, having many friends,
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.880]   have been in a certain type of a church.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.720]   If our worship is contingent upon Jesus and anything else,
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.780]   you've really missed the whole point of worship, right?
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.100]   He gave his only begotten son.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.900]   Why would a God who is holy, holy, holy
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.740]   send his only begotten son to save a sinner like me?
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.820]   And then to say, I believe that,
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.820]   and then spend the rest of the time complaining
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.700]   about the bike you didn't get, or car,
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.940]   or the promotion you didn't get,
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.260]   and the people you didn't like.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.420]   It just kind of doesn't make sense.
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.060]   Something is kind of off, right?
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.420]   So, the very beginning of our relationship with God
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.920]   and at the church, at the core of why we exist
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.540]   is to celebrate this holy, holy God
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.180]   who sent his only begotten son, right?
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:07.180]   So, even the very word for worship in English
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.580]   is from a Latin word, we are scipe,
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.220]   which means to give value to something, right?
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.740]   To give value to something.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.260]   So, by that very definition,
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:21.880]   we come and worship him because he is worthy.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.500]   Not necessarily simply because, well, he did,
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.420]   he answered my prayers, and this and that,
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.660]   but by very nature of who he is and who we are,
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.220]   our relationship with creation and creator
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.780]   is to give worship, right?
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.540]   And J.I. Packer, in his book, Knowing God,
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.620]   says, "Ancient paganism thought of each god
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.700]   "as a bound to his worshippers by bonds of self-interest,
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.400]   "because he depended on their service
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.120]   "and gifts for his welfare.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.300]   "Modern paganism has at the back of its mind
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.180]   "a similar feeling that God is somehow obliged to love
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.660]   "and help us, little though we deserve it."
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.180]   So, again, our very approach to God, right?
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.940]   Does it reflect paganism, where it said,
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.140]   well, you know, we're doing this to get something from God,
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.340]   but at the core of our worship is recognizing who he is
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.160]   and that he is worthy of worship, okay?
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.700]   So, again, the definition of worship
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.420]   is something that happens when we encounter
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.040]   something greater than us.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:24.220]   So, if we have a very trivial view of who God is,
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.700]   it will directly affect the way you worship God, right?
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.340]   Worship, by definition, is being in awe
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.300]   in the presence of something mightier and holier than you.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.620]   So, we worship things that we value.
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.220]   So, if you value basketball superstars,
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.460]   you end up worshiping that.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.460]   If you value money, you end up worshiping that.
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.700]   Whatever you think that you give value to
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.660]   is what you end up worshiping, right?
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.900]   So, at the core of what worship means
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.360]   is to recognize the value of who God is, right?
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.180]   So, if the picture of God that we have
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.020]   is a servant running around,
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.060]   like doing whatever we ask him to do,
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.460]   by nature, you're not worshiping him, right?
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.420]   So, again, why a correct understanding of God
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.820]   is at the core of true worship.
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.220]   Without it, you can't really worship God, right?
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.260]   Again, the greater the object that is being encountered,
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.100]   greater the response in worship,
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.100]   and we are creatures created for this very purpose.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:26.380]   So, this is the first,
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.860]   first vision of our church,
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.620]   is that more important than anything else at church,
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.100]   that we want to exalt who he is,
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.940]   and we want people who are coming to church
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.540]   for this reason, right?
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.240]   Our primary reason why we make decisions on certain things
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.860]   is not so that we can get most people into the door.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.500]   We are interested in saving souls.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.140]   We want to encourage people, we want to properly train,
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.300]   all of those things are of interest,
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:59.300]   but never to do that with this as a compromise, right?
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.900]   So, our greatest concern week after week
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.180]   is God being exalted,
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.460]   and our people recognizing the God that they worship, right?
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.620]   That our worship is not centered around you,
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.700]   it's not centered around me, it's centered around who he is.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.580]   So, whatever decisions we make,
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.360]   philosophical things that we change,
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.880]   it's primarily because we think it'll honor God,
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.700]   even if it drives people away, right?
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.240]   So, again, that's at the core of why we do what we do.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:34.580]   By definition of what worship is, it must be God-centered,
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.940]   since God is the one we are coming to encounter.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.020]   We're not coming to encounter music,
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.140]   we're not coming to encounter the band,
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.900]   or even people, right?
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.100]   And I think it is important,
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.700]   community is very, very important, right?
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.320]   But I would say that the greatest thing
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.440]   that you should be looking for,
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.260]   let's say you just like, okay, you know,
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.100]   I'm going out of town and I need to look for a church,
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.640]   you know, in Florida or something,
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.920]   like what is the primary thing
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.180]   that you should be looking for?
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.700]   Is worship, a place where you can go to worship, right?
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.500]   First, that should be your first and foremost,
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.360]   a place where God is exalted,
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.140]   where people see God as the most,
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.860]   very, very high view of God,
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.780]   and then in that context, you wanna find fellowship,
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.580]   who are seeking God in the same manner, right?
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.580]   But if you go the other way and say,
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.600]   oh, I wanna find friends or community
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.460]   where I can connect with people,
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.940]   and then hopefully those group of friends that I find
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.500]   will be exalting God at the same time,
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.860]   I mean, you're gonna be frustrated
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.020]   because fellowship is linked to this, okay?
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.520]   So again, I wanted to, again, for those of you
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.400]   who have been at our church for a while
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.960]   and new to the church, you know, again,
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.200]   to, I mean, I wish I could just spend the whole day
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.800]   just talking about the importance of this
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.960]   and why this is so important,
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.960]   but because we are in a market-driven culture,
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.960]   we're growing the church and making it big,
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.040]   and even if it's not making it big,
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.320]   it's just satisfying the needs of the people, right?
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.320]   Like, what do you need?
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.720]   And then survey the church and see,
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.580]   well, who's unhappy and what are you unhappy about?
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.080]   And then we survey the people,
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.440]   and then we try to fix things
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.680]   so that more people can be happy in the church.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.120]   That is not our goal in the church, right?
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.320]   As leaders and as one of the teachers in the church,
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.600]   our primary goal is a lot of times you're unsatisfied
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.340]   because there's something wrong in your heart, right?
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.680]   You might be desiring something
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.400]   that God may not be offering you, right?
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.280]   So I'm not saying that that's always the case,
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.360]   the leaders are not always right, right?
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.920]   But our primary concern is making sure
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.680]   that we're discipling the church
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.800]   to bring them to Christ first
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.720]   before we're concerned about anything else, okay?
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.920]   So the second vision of our church
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.120]   is to equip the church with God's inerrant word,
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.760]   and so I worded it a different way
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.880]   for the sake of this class,
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.320]   is that we want a God-centered
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.580]   biblical interpretation and application.
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.440]   We're not going into scripture doing eisegesis,
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.400]   meaning like, what do I want?
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.820]   Like, I want to find comfort,
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.780]   so you look for scripture that's gonna bring comfort, right?
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.960]   I survey our church,
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.540]   and a lot of people are struggling with raising children,
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.340]   so now I'm gonna go look for passages
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.200]   so that I can encourage you in raising children, right?
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.280]   That's not how we interpret the scripture.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.400]   Even the way we study the Bible is God-centered, okay?
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.680]   So let me explain to you what that means.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:34.040]   The scripture says the word of God is God-breathed.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.060]   In 2 Timothy 3, 16, all scripture is breathed out by God,
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.220]   right, all scripture is breathed out by God.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.380]   It means that his very breath is in his word.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.680]   So what is the primary way that we encounter this God?
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.320]   Primary way that we encounter this God that we worship
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.460]   is through the scripture, the primary way.
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.640]   Does it mean that God can't reveal himself
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.580]   through circumstances and things that happen in our life?
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.900]   He can, but the scripture clearly says
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.380]   the avenue in which we encounter God is through his word,
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.580]   right, so remember, again,
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:09.820]   I'm not gonna go too deep into this
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.300]   because Pastor Mark is gonna cover it next week,
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:16.020]   but remember Peter, James, and John,
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:20.380]   when they have an encounter with God at the transfiguration,
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.340]   right, God says, "This is my son in whom I am well pleased,"
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.440]   and then when he sees the glory of Christ,
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.260]   what happens to him, right?
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.540]   They all fall down in fear.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.100]   Remember we talked about that,
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.940]   the first act of worship when you encounter God,
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.340]   there's trembling and fear, they recognize their sin.
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.260]   Well, that's what happened to the three of them,
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.300]   and afterwards, they're warned.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.100]   Remember what they were warned not to do?
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.980]   Anybody remember?
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.540]   After they encounter God,
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.240]   you would expect God to say, "Go tell everybody."
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.140]   Is that what God tells them?
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.740]   He said, "Don't tell anybody," right?
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.500]   He said, "'Cause it wasn't time yet.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.940]   "It wasn't time to go and exalt him yet."
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.700]   So he kinda keeps it quiet,
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.140]   and then later on in 2 Peter,
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:10.140]   Peter talks about how his testimony
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.340]   and what he was saying wasn't made up,
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.380]   that he was eyewitness of God saying that, "This is my son,"
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.020]   because it was time to exalt him.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.740]   But then if you know that passage,
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.800]   again, I should've written it down,
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.860]   but if you look at that passage,
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.260]   the passage says, "But I have something more sure
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.380]   "than the testimony in me hearing his voice."
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.020]   Remember what he says about that?
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.400]   Maybe we should go there.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.200]   Turn to 2 Peter, okay?
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:40.420]   Again, I didn't wanna spend too much time here,
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.620]   'cause Pastor Mark is gonna talk about this.
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:51.560]   2 Peter 1, verse 16.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.000]   For we did not follow cleverly devised myths
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.740]   when we made known to you the power
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.620]   and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.740]   for we were eyewitnesses of his majesty,
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.700]   talking about the transfiguration.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.620]   For when he received honor and glory from God the Father,
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:09.340]   and the voice was born to him by the majestic glory,
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.940]   this is my beloved son, with him I am well pleased.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.860]   We ourselves heard this very voice born from heaven,
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.780]   for we were with him on the holy mountain.
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.020]   So stop right there.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.900]   I mean, what can be more reassuring than to know
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.860]   that they're talking to somebody who actually saw
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:30.300]   and heard this transfiguration?
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.140]   But the interesting thing is, right after that it says,
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.660]   and we have something more sure than what he heard,
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.260]   his own eyes and his own ears.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.500]   The prophetic word to which you will do well
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.940]   to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.460]   until the day dawns and the morning star rises
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.300]   in your heart.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.180]   So I'm just gonna stop right there,
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.540]   because again, like I said, Pastor Mark's gonna spend
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.880]   a little bit more time talking about that next week.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.320]   So the primary way that God has ordained for us
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.600]   to encounter this God that we worship is his word.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.080]   So if you have people who are in the church
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.180]   and fellowshipping and doing all this stuff,
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.720]   but it's not regularly in the word of God, right?
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.220]   You cannot be encountering God,
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.600]   because that's his primary way that God called us
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.480]   to encounter him, right?
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.200]   That's why it is essential for us.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.480]   If we're gonna have a God-centered worship,
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.920]   one of the first things that we need to do and recognize
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.800]   is to honor God by having high view of his word, right?
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.520]   His word is lifted up.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.040]   So that's what we're trying to do at church.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.760]   It's not because, well, this church is about missions,
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.080]   this church is about discipleship,
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.740]   this church is about his word.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.520]   The reason why the word is emphasized in our church
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.920]   is because we're trying to put Christ and God
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.440]   at the center of the church, right?
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.960]   And so we have high view of God,
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.660]   because it is his very breath that it says.
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:51.560]   The goal of the church is to make his voice clear
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.720]   and not man's.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.800]   So I can stand here and talk to you about
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.040]   how to be a good father and how to do this
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.720]   and how to do that.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.380]   There's nothing necessarily innately wrong with that,
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.160]   but the primary goal of the church,
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.120]   primary goal of the pulpit ought to be
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.120]   to make his voice clear, right?
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.160]   What does God say?
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.560]   What does the scripture say?
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.800]   He says in John 10, 27, "My sheep hear my voice
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.440]   "and they follow me," right?
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.720]   "My sheep hear my voice and they follow me."
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.600]   So every part of that sentence is about Christ, right?
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.720]   So as ambassadors of Christ, our primary job
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.360]   is to make sure that if you hear anything
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.080]   from the pulpit and from the Bible study,
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.880]   that you hear his voice, that you don't go and say,
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.080]   "That's his opinion or someone else's opinion."
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.240]   And if I say anything that contradicts the scripture,
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.800]   right, we're Bereans, we're supposed to test it, right?
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.480]   So your confidence doesn't come from certain men
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.080]   or women that you have confidence in,
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.800]   but it's in God's word, right?
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.600]   Why do we do expository preaching?
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:07.060]   Again, versus topical preaching at church.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.600]   We wanna make sure that we understand
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.200]   what God's intent in the passage is,
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.440]   not to add our own meaning, okay?
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.680]   And when we do expository preaching,
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.040]   we're going verse by verse,
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.920]   and we're looking at the context and historical context,
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.880]   that we're trying to understand the meaning
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.560]   behind how they heard it, right?
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.340]   And not to see it as a mystical book
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.960]   that just kind of whatever you get out of it.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.080]   And that's the problem that we have with our generation.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.360]   You have, you know, I hear Donald Trump
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.180]   and Barack Obama and Clinton,
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.880]   like all of them quoting scripture
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.760]   has nothing to do with what that passage says.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.480]   Because the way that, you know,
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.360]   a lot of the churches approach scripture is,
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.640]   you know, what does it mean for you?
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.000]   Doesn't matter what it means for you,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.200]   it matters what did he mean, right?
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.320]   So that's why we do expository preaching,
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.640]   that we wanna first know what did Paul mean?
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.640]   What did God mean when he said this?
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.840]   How did they understand it?
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.640]   And that's why we do it, we teach expository,
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.840]   instead of just topic, you say,
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.840]   I wanna talk about this, and then just pick certain verses.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.980]   We also go through scripture, systematically,
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.820]   because we want to make sure that the whole counsel
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:20.120]   of God is taught and not just select subjects, right?
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.420]   Now, I can honestly tell you,
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.380]   there are certain subjects that I prefer not to talk about.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:32.240]   And there are certain things that I'm afraid
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.860]   that if I say it up in the pulpits,
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.520]   some people are gonna interpret it the wrong way.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.580]   And there are some times when I would have a conversation,
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.460]   or may have had a heated conversation for many weeks,
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.980]   and then that subject comes up,
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.180]   and I gotta talk about it, you know?
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.660]   Or there are certain sensitive subjects in our culture,
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.340]   in our generation, that I know if I say these things,
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.500]   or if I get on the subject,
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.300]   it's gonna cause a stir in the church,
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.700]   or maybe an outsider may hear it wrong.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:02.780]   But by teaching systematically, I don't have a choice.
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:03.700]   And for the sake of time,
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.700]   I'm not gonna give you any examples,
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.700]   but I've been preaching on this pulpit,
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.520]   the same pulpit for almost 20 years,
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.180]   and there have been many Sundays,
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.660]   I dreaded, because I saw it coming.
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.460]   Okay, and again, for the sake of time,
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.780]   I will tell you in private,
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.380]   but I'm not gonna say it in public, okay?
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.260]   There have been times when I saw that coming,
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.820]   and I was kinda like, oh my gosh,
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.620]   when that's coming, what am I gonna say?
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.660]   That person sitting in the room,
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:31.860]   how are they gonna interpret this,
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.100]   or she's gonna think that I'm talking to her.
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.960]   And then that subject came,
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.980]   and I just had to preach it,
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.040]   because it was coming, unless I just skipped over it.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.720]   And there have been many times,
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.520]   and I can honestly tell you,
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.520]   the benefit of doing that is,
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.600]   because I'm a man too, and I have fear,
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.960]   I don't wanna cause controversy,
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.320]   but by preaching and teaching systematically,
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.960]   it forces us to deal with everything.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.640]   Things that I like, things that I'm good at,
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.920]   things that I'm not good at,
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.440]   so that we get the whole counsel of God.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.760]   To make sure that, again, we're exalting Christ,
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.440]   and his word, and not man.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:14.180]   And finally, the word of God has final authority
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.260]   in our personal lives,
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.500]   as well as the corporate life of the church.
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:22.540]   If you ever want to get my attention about something
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.340]   that you really feel dire need to address in the church,
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.980]   Pastor Peter is so stubborn,
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.380]   he won't listen to anything, which may be true,
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.400]   but if you really want to get my attention,
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.040]   bring your Bible, bring your Bible,
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.600]   and show me what convicted you.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.160]   If you come to me with your opinions,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.000]   you're one of 500 other people with opinions, right?
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.400]   And so, you come with your fist shaking,
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.040]   it's like, "Oh, why don't we do this?
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.320]   "How come we don't do this?"
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.080]   Well, I heard you, and I heard another guy
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.800]   who told me exactly the opposite, right?
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.960]   So, I'm always kinda hearing opinions and voices
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.780]   constantly, so if you really want me to pay attention,
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.940]   you have to open up the Bible and tell me
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:11.800]   what convicted you to say, or, "Hey, we really need
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.220]   "to address this issue according to Scripture," right?
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.400]   Otherwise, your voice is gonna be just one of many opinions.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.380]   Everybody has opinions.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.180]   You have opinions, I have opinions,
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.480]   person down the street has opinions, right?
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.340]   I've had sermons that I preached,
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.100]   and that same week, sat down with somebody,
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.020]   telling me that our church is gonna be ruined
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.220]   because of the way I preach,
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.160]   and then I had another person sit me down,
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.320]   literally two days later, raving about how they were blessed
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.240]   in that same message, okay?
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.200]   So, at the end of the day, I have to just keep going.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.780]   I have to make sure, like, this is what I'm convicted in,
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.780]   and as long as I don't see what you're telling me
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.960]   through Scripture, you're probably not gonna get
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.740]   my attention, 'cause the final authority in my life
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.000]   is the Word of God, and the final authority
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.100]   in our church life is the Word of God, right?
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.300]   So, if you don't bring the Word of God,
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.660]   all it'll sound like is, I know better than you,
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.340]   I'm smarter than you, and I have everybody else
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:10.860]   telling me the same thing.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.380]   So, it's very difficult to pay attention
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.940]   to a lot of people telling me that they're smarter,
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.860]   because I just want to put you guys together,
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.660]   and then figure it out, and then one person
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.160]   represent the church and come to me, right?
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.980]   But if you really want to get the ear of the leaders,
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.740]   you have to go through the Word of God,
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.580]   because the final authority is His Word.
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.860]   So, as long as you can point to me in Scripture,
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.100]   and point to the leaders in the Scripture,
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.020]   this is what we need to do, then there's nothing
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.460]   that we're doing that can't be changed,
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.060]   if we're doing it wrong, right?
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.400]   If we're contradicting Scripture, right?
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.180]   And this is true, like, you know,
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.700]   whether it's an issue of homosexuality,
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.620]   women in ministry, there's a lot of topics
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.900]   that are not popular in our generation,
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.620]   and we're becoming more and more of a minority every year,
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.060]   but again, we are not going to move,
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.900]   as long as the Scripture is clear on this subject, right?
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.900]   We say what we say, because this is what we see
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.940]   in Scripture, and so, if you have any questions
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.420]   about why does our church do this,
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.860]   why does our church do that, first thing I'm gonna do
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.500]   is open up the Scripture and tell you, right?
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.180]   So, if you have a rebuttal to that, that's Scriptural,
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:22.420]   not cultural, not opinion, not your insight,
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.060]   but Scriptural, then we'll have a good conversation.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.780]   Otherwise, I'm just gonna say,
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.940]   that's what the Bible says, okay?
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.140]   (audience member applauds)
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.980]   Church life is also God-centered,
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.780]   so we have God-centered worship, God-centered Bible study,
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.940]   God-centered church, right?
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.980]   Again, the first thing that I wanna emphasize
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:48.300]   is the gathering of the church is a holy community,
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.900]   because we are the body of Christ,
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.340]   so we have to have a high view of God,
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:59.340]   high view of Scripture, and high view of the church, right?
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:04.420]   So, God doesn't serve us, we serve the church.
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:08.020]   The church isn't, the Scripture isn't twisted to serve me.
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.340]   I submit to the Scripture.
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.060]   Church does not exist to serve you.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.220]   We exist to establish the church, okay?
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.180]   Let's make that very clear.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.740]   The church is a gathering of people who've been saved,
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.060]   who belong to Christ, whose ownership is Christ,
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.580]   and this is where he reigns, right?
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.060]   This is where he reigns.
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:33.220]   So, again, the adjustment in attitude that we need to have
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.860]   if we have the wrong attitude toward churches,
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.580]   because we live in a generation
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.940]   where we have every church down the street,
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.620]   it's kinda like a smorgasbord.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.060]   I like this about this church, so I go there,
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.540]   and if I like it, I serve it for a while,
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.100]   and if I don't like it, I just move on,
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.660]   and then I just, you know,
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.120]   just kinda going through a buffet line,
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.780]   and then you just kinda pick and choose what you want,
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:56.380]   and then, you know, and I'm kinda exaggerating,
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.380]   but we do live in a generation
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.020]   where the view of the church is like,
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.220]   because everybody's competing
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.100]   to get people to come to their church,
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.740]   so as consumers, we're kinda like,
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.140]   okay, what do you have to offer?
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.700]   What does this church have to offer?
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.780]   And then it ruins worship,
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:16.500]   and then it causes the church to be just another avenue
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.660]   for me to get what I want.
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.540]   So if this church doesn't have friends my age,
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.700]   or that church doesn't have this,
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.900]   and then we just go shopping, right?
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.060]   So if we have a high view of God,
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.700]   high view of His word,
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.200]   the scripture teaches us to have a high view of His church.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.180]   Right?
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.260]   1 Corinthians 3, 16, and 17,
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.820]   there was a division in the Corinthians church,
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.300]   and so Paul is dealing with this division,
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.220]   and he says, "Do you not know that you,"
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.300]   and the you here is in plural,
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.780]   referring to the body of Christ, okay?
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.740]   "Do you not know that you are God's temple,
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.300]   "and that God's Spirit dwells in you?"
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.300]   So let me stop right here.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.080]   What did the temple mean to a Jew?
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:59.300]   It was the most sacred place, right?
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.560]   It was the most sacred place
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.260]   that you couldn't just enter in and out.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.580]   There are certain people, if you had any kind of defect,
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:09.100]   if you were a Gentile, if you had any kind of disease,
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.660]   if you were on your monthly flow,
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.020]   I mean, all kinds of things,
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.980]   you couldn't enter the temple.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:18.100]   So the temple to a Jew was the most holiest of place.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.460]   So when Paul says to the Corinthians,
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.460]   "That you, your body now, not the physical temple,
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.100]   "but your gathering, your church, is the temple of God,"
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:31.100]   immediately, any Jew would have understood this as sacred.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:36.940]   Where does the sacredness first appear in the scripture
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.300]   to teach us about the sacredness of the church?
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:44.220]   In the book of Acts.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.500]   Anybody?
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:58.660]   What does it appear?
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:04.020]   Ananias and Sapphira, right?
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.500]   In Acts chapter, I'm not gonna read the whole thing,
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.460]   but basically they lie to the church,
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:14.100]   and Peter condemns them, and they fall down and die.
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:14.940]   Right?
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:15.760]   I mean, it's like, oh my gosh,
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.240]   what's the sacredness of the church, right?
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.600]   And as a result of the capital punishment
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.040]   that comes upon this couple,
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.120]   it says that all the disciples were afraid
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.000]   to be around the apostles.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.680]   So you're talking about a seeker-friendly church,
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.400]   I mean, these guys were exactly the opposite, right?
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.600]   They put fear in the people.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.160]   And we don't have apostles today,
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.360]   so you don't have to worry about people dying,
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.040]   you know, at least not in that way.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.280]   But they put fear in the people
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.720]   because they were trying to teach the early church
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.460]   the sacredness of the gathering.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.140]   And so when that came upon them,
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.560]   it says people were so afraid
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.000]   that they wouldn't want to associate with the apostles,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.840]   and yet the Lord was adding to the number.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.200]   Daily, those were being saved, right?
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.440]   So they weren't coming to church because it was safe.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.840]   They were coming to church because they recognized
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.400]   that that's where the Spirit of God dwelt, right?
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.280]   And so that church that was established
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.820]   and built in the early church,
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.540]   we are connected to that church.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:20.000]   So obviously, the sacredness of the church
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.440]   is extremely important, right?
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.400]   1 Peter 2.9, "You are a chosen race,
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.040]   "a royal priesthood, a holy nation."
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.920]   And again, understand that word holy
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.320]   as we learned it from Scripture.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.680]   "A people for his own possession,
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.640]   "that you may proclaim the excellencies of him
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.320]   "who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light."
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.980]   So it's not just the pastor, it's not just the Bible,
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.680]   but it's the church itself, right?
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.740]   You and I have become holy, right?
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.100]   Individually, we have become holy.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.180]   1 Corinthians 6.19 also talks about us being the temple,
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.380]   but again, in 1 Corinthians 3.16,
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.220]   he's talking about the body of Christ.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:00.180]   So high view of the church, right?
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.480]   And this is why we practice church membership.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.860]   Again, I'm not gonna read that.
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.820]   You can just jot that down.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.740]   1 Corinthians 12.12-15, "Just as the body is one
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.740]   "and has many members, and all of the members of the body,
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:15.180]   "though many are one body, so it is with Christ."
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.100]   So this, again, is the body of Christ.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.300]   And the reason why we practice membership
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.660]   is because a church should not be a place
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.060]   where you just come in and out, right?
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.320]   Saying, "I wanna be part of this body one day,
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.560]   "and that body the next day,
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.780]   "and then the body down the street the other day."
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.900]   So we practice membership to recognize
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.100]   that these are the people who have committed
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.580]   to the local body of Christ, right?
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.540]   Now, I didn't put it down here because, again,
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.100]   we're gonna go into a little bit more detail later on
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.220]   when we're on the subject of the church.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:50.220]   But there's a universal church, the unseen church,
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.900]   and then the local church, right?
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:57.900]   Universal church is the unseen church of all believers.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.860]   Everywhere, that's the universal church.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.220]   That's the true church.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:04.380]   But that universal church is expressed
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.000]   through the local church.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.700]   We don't have membership in the universal church
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.980]   other than our belief in Christ, right?
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:15.620]   But the actual living out and obedience
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.100]   in that universal church is always expressed
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.540]   through the local church.
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:24.940]   So Ephesians 4, 15 to 16,
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:28.240]   "From him the whole body joined and held together
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.060]   "by every supporting ligament grows
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.720]   "and builds itself up in love
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.660]   "as each part does its work."
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.600]   So God has gifted every single person
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.340]   so that we may use that for what purpose?
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.860]   To exalt yourself?
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.820]   To exalt God by yourself?
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:47.660]   No.
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.540]   He said each gift was given so that you can play your part
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.820]   in building the body of Christ.
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.880]   So you're only playing a part, right?
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.060]   Whatever part that may be,
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.780]   whether you're a foot or your hand, you're playing a part.
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.760]   So if you're not part of the church,
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.780]   you can be doing stuff,
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.280]   but you're not building the church, right?
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.060]   Again, I just took some sample verses
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.260]   and I'm not gonna read it all out to you,
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.300]   but it says Romans 12,
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.700]   "To be devoted to one another,
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.860]   "live in harmony with one another,
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.100]   "instruct one another, serve one another,
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.740]   "submit to one another, teach one another,
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.440]   "encourage one another, spur on one another,
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.020]   "show hospitality toward one another,
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:25.820]   "clothe yourself with humility toward one another,
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.780]   "love one another."
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.280]   So everything that we see in scripture
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.420]   is to be practiced with one another.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.300]   And the one another,
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.620]   every one of these letters are written to who?
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.460]   Right?
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.100]   With the, to churches.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.400]   Not universal church, but to local churches, right?
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.540]   Typically it was delivered to the elder
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.840]   and the elder would read it to the church that he's with.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.680]   Right?
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:56.680]   So you can't practice Christianity outside of the church.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.680]   There is no one another.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:01.660]   You don't know what your gift is outside the church, right?
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.380]   You can go outside the church and say,
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.560]   my gift is in singing,
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.620]   but if the church doesn't confirm that that's your gift,
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.660]   you can say whatever you want.
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.500]   Right?
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.340]   You can say, you know, I'm so good with hospitality.
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.220]   And everybody around you say, no.
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.420]   You know what I mean?
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.820]   I'm so humble, no.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:19.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.420]   You know, I really love to give, no.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:23.300]   Right?
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.260]   How do we know what kind of gifts God has given us
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.780]   and what we're good at, what we're not good at,
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.860]   or even our weaknesses?
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.400]   You know, most of what is taught about choosing elders,
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.780]   being hospitable, and not being a drunkard,
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.780]   all of that stuff is tested in the community
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.220]   that you belong.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.060]   Right?
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:41.380]   So let me say this on a side note.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:47.800]   If you have been getting consistent complaints
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.300]   from various people about the same thing,
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.940]   and every time you hear it,
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:56.100]   you're always saying those people are unfair, right?
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:01.060]   There's a great chance that that's your blind spot.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:05.580]   There's a great chance that there is an issue with you
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.900]   that you just refuse,
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.560]   your pride just would not allow it to yield, right?
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.020]   So sanctification oftentimes happens
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.300]   in the context of a community.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.580]   In fact, not often, all the time, right?
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.740]   That's why when people come to church,
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.820]   initially they love it because everybody's so nice
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.220]   and you don't know each other's sin.
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.680]   But real sanctification happens
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.980]   when you're sick of each other, right?
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.140]   No, that's when sanctification happens.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.600]   Real sanctification happens when all of a sudden
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.580]   it's hard to love these people.
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.660]   There's certain people that rub you the wrong way,
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.280]   there's certain people who don't behave the way
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.140]   that you want them to behave.
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.280]   That's when your graciousness,
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.780]   that's when your patience, your temperance,
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.140]   that's when hospitality, your love,
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.740]   all of that, that's when it's tested, right?
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.820]   Sanctification happens when you're rubbing each other.
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.460]   So tell me somebody who doesn't know how to love somebody
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.300]   who's lovable.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.400]   Right?
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.260]   I mean, you're just a miserable fool if that's the case.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.340]   I mean, Christians and non-Christians alike,
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.720]   if you have somebody lovable at work,
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.020]   I bet you they receive a lot of love, right?
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.420]   Somebody who's gracious and loving,
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.780]   I mean, everybody knows how to do that.
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:15.820]   It's the love that Christ calls us to love
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.220]   is unlike the love of the world.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.420]   That's why he puts us in the context of a church.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:24.860]   And again, if you're in a habit of running from people
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.340]   that rub you the wrong way because of certain things,
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.660]   then there's a huge blind spot even in your life, right?
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.400]   There's an area that you're not growing in
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.520]   and you refuse to grow in
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.960]   because you refuse to submit to that.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.680]   So the body of Christ is given to us,
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.760]   again, ultimately for the worship of God,
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.560]   but for our own sanctification, right?
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.120]   'Cause I guarantee you, if you're around people
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.080]   and they know you long enough,
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.360]   they're gonna know your weak spot.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.360]   And if they know your weak spot, they're sinners,
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.980]   so they're gonna point at that too, right?
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.680]   But that's what causes us to grow.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.080]   Okay, we practice accountability, right?
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.240]   Again, several scriptures,
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.840]   I'm not gonna go through all of them,
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.800]   it talks about purging the evil person from among you.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.000]   Again, in our generation,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.920]   the idea of church discipline is so foreign
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.580]   because we've taught and preached grace
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.120]   to the point where the holiness of God
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:21.640]   sounds very strange in the church, right?
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.520]   But again, when you see it from top down,
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:28.040]   when God-centered worship, God-centered scripture,
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.240]   God-centered church, high view of the church,
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.920]   then we can understand why God tells us
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.920]   to keep the church holy, right?
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.200]   And again, this is not to say,
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.040]   go around and point out everybody's sin.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:42.440]   When a sin is elevated to the extent
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.840]   that it's not only harmful to them,
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.520]   it starts to be harmful to the church
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.440]   and they're unrepentant,
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.120]   then it is elevated to church discipline, right?
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.000]   So we practice accountability in the church.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.600]   And this, again, accountability happens two ways.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.560]   One is when it's elevated to that extent
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.840]   and the church leaders need to get involved officially,
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.120]   but the real accountability on the day-to-day basis
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.320]   where we don't just sweep sin under the rug, right?
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.600]   Like if somebody sins, it's pretty obvious,
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.100]   and you're concerned for them,
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.640]   it is not loving to just turn the other way, right?
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.920]   If you have somebody you care about,
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.800]   your son or daughter or your brother or sister
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.080]   or mom or dad, is headed down the path
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.560]   that's destructive to them,
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.400]   it is not loving to look the other way
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.720]   and pretend like that's not happening, right?
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.720]   And typically in a church like this,
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.440]   you can feel safe, like, oh, I'm glad
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.760]   that the leaders practice church discipline.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.360]   There's only about five or six of us, right?
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.240]   If the church is going to be viewed highly,
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.440]   the church members have to practice accountability
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.480]   in love, right?
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.680]   If you practice accountability with people you don't like,
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.320]   that's not accountability.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.760]   That's vengeance, right?
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.640]   That's judgmentalism, that's gossip, right?
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.520]   We're talking about people that are close to you,
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.800]   they're your friends, the people that are very awkward
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.400]   for you to bring up, right?
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.200]   Especially those people, those are the people
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.500]   that you need to keep accountable
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.800]   because everybody has blind spots.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.960]   So if the community is only dependent
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.960]   on the leaders to point out sin,
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.480]   there's no way that the church is gonna remain holy, right?
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.000]   So there needs to be accountability
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.840]   in the lives of the people when you see it.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.480]   Again, when you point out sin,
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.920]   the purpose of this is not to say,
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.000]   hey, you're sinning, I pointed out, I did my job, right?
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.840]   The purpose of that is to turn them from their sin
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.480]   and then point them back to Christ,
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.120]   and that we have a community of believers
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.160]   that actually try to practice that.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.660]   Again, there's a fine line between being judgmental
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.300]   and practicing grace and love
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.140]   by speaking the truth in love,
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.680]   but that's part of sanctification,
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.400]   learning how to do that and do that well, right?
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.960]   (pages rustling)
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.200]   Okay, so we are accountable to each other,
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.240]   Joshua 7, 16 to 18, okay?
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.820]   You can just write it down, look at it later.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:03.320]   This is where God is judging the nation of Israel
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.080]   because of a man named Achan.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.600]   He took certain things that God told him not to touch
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.120]   in the city of Jericho, and as a result of that,
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.560]   they get judged.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.800]   And so when God is ready to judge him,
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.360]   he doesn't just say, "Achan, you come out."
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.560]   If you notice, he goes through,
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.280]   he brings the whole nation of Israel out, right?
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.120]   It's because of this one guy's sin.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:30.120]   One guy's sin, over a million people have to stand in line,
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.760]   and then out of all of Israel, he calls out Judah
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.520]   because that's the tribe he comes from,
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.440]   and then from there, he calls the clan of the Zerrites,
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.960]   and then from there, he calls the family of Zimri,
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.920]   and then from there, he calls the family,
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.000]   and then ultimately, he gets to Achan.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.120]   So why does he go through all of that drama,
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.480]   a million people to call out this one guy, right?
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.680]   And we see this consistently throughout scripture
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:01.040]   because God sees us in communities, right?
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.240]   Are we our brother's keepers?
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.160]   Yes, we're accountable to each other.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.920]   If somebody is living in sin
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.600]   and you choose to ignore that, right?
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.480]   That's just like if something is happening to,
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.000]   like my children are doing something
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.440]   and the older brother and younger brother,
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.120]   and you say, "Ah, it's his problem, he doesn't care."
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.240]   There's some responsibility to the older brother
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:26.160]   for not caring enough to say something or do something,
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.160]   right, it's because we see,
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.120]   there's a perfect illustration of this
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.120]   in how God deals with sin of Achan
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.680]   in this particular passage.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:40.280]   And this is, again, why biblical leadership
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.560]   is so important, right?
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.920]   In 1 Timothy 3, two,
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.680]   and Titus gives a list of qualifications of an elder.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.120]   Obviously, he must be a Christian, right?
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.360]   That's a given.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.360]   But there's all these other,
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.640]   like he must be above reproach,
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.920]   basically meaning that there's no accusation
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.400]   that can be brought against him.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.840]   Husband of one wife, that he needs to be proven at home.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.600]   And so all these other qualities.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.080]   And then he says, "Make sure that he's not a recent convert
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.520]   "because the greatest concern of leadership
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.580]   "that he may become puffed up and conceited
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:14.040]   "and fall into condemnation of the devil."
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:14.880]   Right?
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.480]   So one of the most important qualification of an elder
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.960]   that he is not going to get to his head
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.720]   because once it gets to his head, what happens?
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.520]   His whole calling is to serve the church
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.160]   and to magnify Christ.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.200]   But if somebody stands in between pointing to Christ
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.200]   and then he wants some of the glory, right, what happens?
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.020]   He can't do his job, right?
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.080]   So one of the greatest, he said,
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.400]   "You don't put in newcomers because the greatest fear
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.960]   "is that he may become conceited and become proud."
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.000]   And then that in and of itself would disqualify all of this
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   because he's doing all of this for his own glory, right?
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   So if a church is to glorify God,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.440]   we need men who are gonna be humbled
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.920]   and not take the glory and give the glory to God, right?
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.400]   And that's why we follow biblical mandate of leadership.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.720]   No matter how gifted you are or talented
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:13.180]   or how respected you are in society,
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.100]   if we are first and foremost,
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.740]   like we're talking about on Sunday,
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.980]   not broken, not humbled, and not compassionate, right?
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.340]   At some point, that's gonna manifest in the leadership.
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:26.340]   So that's the first thing that, again,
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.540]   in order to glorify God.
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:30.640]   Communion, baptism.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:35.860]   Just shout it down.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.780]   I'm just gonna pass by this for the sake of time.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.220]   Okay.
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:44.240]   God-centered evangelism, and I'm gonna talk about this
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.780]   and then we'll end it tonight, okay?
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.840]   God-centered evangelism and not man-centered.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.200]   Man-centered evangelism attempts to make the gospel
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.960]   the most attractive to the most people.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.480]   God-centered evangelism focuses on representing God
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.960]   and his message accurately, right?
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.240]   So we don't change the message,
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:05.560]   we don't change the method, simply because it works, right?
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:10.540]   Our primary goal is to make sure that what he meant
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.740]   in the scripture is presented accurately, right?
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:19.040]   What happens when you have evangelism that's man-centered?
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:26.580]   Highlight the positive and kind of sweep under the rug
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.860]   the negative, and so what's the negative?
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:32.460]   Judgment, right?
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.300]   Commitment.
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.460]   Anything that you think a modern man would not be interested
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.540]   in talking about hell, right?
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.220]   Things that are hard to explain,
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.380]   so we just kind of dummy those things down
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.860]   and then just kind of highlight the good stuff, right?
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:49.420]   God loves you, you know, like God loves you unconditionally.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:52.620]   So we end up highlighting, and all of that is true,
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.580]   but we end up kind of taking certain things out,
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.420]   taking the edges of the gospel away,
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:00.460]   and then so they hear a partial gospel, right?
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.860]   So the goal of evangelism, again, in me speaking,
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:05.660]   God-centered, not man-centered, right?
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:10.660]   Man-centered evangelism ends justify any means, right?
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:11.980]   So they'll use all kinds of means.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:16.140]   If that's gonna get people to church, we'll try it, right?
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.140]   If we do this and tweak this and do this,
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.860]   and if we have the right people here doing that,
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.740]   if we had enough money, right?
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:27.100]   And the God-centered evangelism emphasizes the fact
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:30.660]   that God has ordained the means as well as the ends,
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:33.580]   and that's why in John chapter 15, he said,
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.680]   if you wanna bear fruit, what does he say?
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:41.060]   Remain in me, abide in me, right?
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:46.420]   So when the Holy Spirit, when we abide in the Holy Spirit,
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.180]   the Holy Spirit is gonna cause us to bear fruit, right?
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:55.020]   So it is not by being clever, by new methods,
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.940]   and I'm always weary when I get invitations
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.860]   to either conferences or some seminar,
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:01.980]   and they found a new way.
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.580]   I mean, it's the old way,
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:05.380]   the way we used to do evangelism 20 years ago
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:07.140]   is no longer relevant today,
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.900]   and now we have a new relevant thing,
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.100]   and then another 15 years later,
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:11.740]   they're gonna find another new relevant thing
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.460]   that we're gonna do, you know?
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:19.180]   If you look at scripture, God constantly points backward.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.340]   He doesn't point forward.
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:22.020]   The only time he points forward
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.980]   is to tell us that end's coming, right?
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:27.260]   That Jesus is gonna come and judgment is gonna come
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:28.420]   and heaven is gonna come.
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.180]   That's the only time he points forward.
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.140]   Every time he points backwards to show,
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:35.060]   remember, remember who I am, remember what I did,
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.140]   remember how I delivered Egypt,
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.500]   not Egypt, but Israel, right?
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.700]   Remember when I was faithful to you, remember.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:46.700]   So our means in bringing people to Christ
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:50.180]   should be no different than what the apostles did.
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:51.620]   Our message should be no different
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:53.420]   than the early church, right?
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:57.300]   And I know that, again, humanly speaking,
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.260]   we think like, well, you know,
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.060]   we have people with MBAs and marketing degrees
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:03.340]   and all this stuff and contract people.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.220]   Yes, do those things work?
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:06.980]   It works, right?
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:10.660]   If you have a master's in marketing,
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:15.580]   those techniques will work to bring people to church,
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:19.780]   but it's absolutely useless to bring people to Christ.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.340]   It's absolutely useless to bring people to Christ.
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.660]   There's no, God wasn't waiting for people to get an MBA
[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:28.660]   so that we can do evangelism effectively, right?
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:30.580]   He says when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:33.420]   you will be my witnesses, right?
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:36.020]   That's why these fishermen who knew nothing,
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:39.420]   who were uneducated, was able to rock the world
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:40.860]   because the Holy Spirit was upon them
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:42.340]   and they were remaining in Christ.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:46.180]   So why is that any different today, right?
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.380]   Why do we all of a sudden, 2,000 years later,
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.740]   that we found something new, right?
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:53.660]   And again, I'm not saying that we shouldn't be sophisticated.
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:58.060]   I'm not saying that all of that stuff is absolutely useless,
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:02.020]   but at the core of how we understand bare fruit,
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:06.100]   that ultimately, God gets the glory, right?
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:09.900]   It wasn't because, you know, got a doctor of ministry
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.140]   and how to do ministry and learned all the new techniques
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:14.780]   that all the great churches are doing,
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:15.660]   and if we applied that,
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.420]   that our church is gonna be greater.
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.220]   Yeah, it may help you feel better.
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:22.220]   It may help to bring maybe cohesiveness
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.640]   and help us to communicate better,
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.260]   and none of that is evil, none of that is bad,
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.780]   but it's absolutely useless to bring people to Christ, right?
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.700]   Because the only thing God has ordained
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:35.340]   to bring people to Christ is to preach Christ crucified,
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:37.720]   in season and out of season, okay?
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:42.820]   Man-centered evangelism focuses on profession.
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:45.100]   If they say they accept, that's enough.
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:49.100]   God-centered evangelism focuses on conversion, right?
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.500]   When people encounter God and there's an actual conversion.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.840]   And when I say conversion,
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:58.280]   I'm talking about not just your thoughts, your life,
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.160]   your profession, your affection, your love,
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:04.080]   what you pursue, there's actual conversion that takes place.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:10.920]   Man-centered evangelism focus on a better life here.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.280]   If you believe in God, you know,
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.880]   these things will happen, God will answer your prayer,
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:19.000]   maybe he'll bless your family and your business,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.480]   but God-centered evangelism
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.740]   always focuses on a better eternity.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:28.040]   But like I said, every time God points to the future,
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:33.040]   it's always to tell us that there's hope at the end, right?
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.560]   And so the purpose of preaching the gospel
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.960]   and being Christ-centered and God-exalting
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.000]   is that we wanna make sure that, one,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.620]   that in the church that God is exalted, not man, right?
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:50.760]   But secondly, whatever fruit that we bear,
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:54.380]   that we want that to be true fruit, right?
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.400]   We don't want that to be kind of fruit
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.760]   that church is growing because of these methods
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.800]   that we're implementing in the church, right?
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.920]   Again, don't get me wrong,
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.840]   I don't have any problem with methods.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.000]   Some of you are much better at communication
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.400]   and all this stuff, and I hope that you would use your gifts
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:14.320]   to help the church, but at the core, if you're asking me,
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.920]   like I have so many hours of the week,
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:20.360]   how to invest my time, I will always invest my time
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.240]   to His word, right, to His word
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.080]   and what the word of God says, right?
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:29.240]   Instead of running around trying to attend seminars
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:33.160]   to see the latest method, whatever it is working, right?
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:36.920]   'Cause like I said, I think I've shared this so many times,
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:43.560]   I figured out very early on how to grow a church, right?
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.880]   And you can disagree with me, but it's pretty simple.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.560]   It's pretty simple, right?
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.080]   Make sure you have the best looking people
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:55.280]   at the welcome tables, right?
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.160]   If you want a young, single crowd
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.160]   that want to come and get hit,
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.960]   make sure you have all the nicest
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:01.840]   and the welcoming people at the welcome table
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.880]   when they come in.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.680]   And then what kind of sermon I give,
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:09.360]   that sermons have to be simple, it has to be funny,
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.040]   it has to be encouraging, right?
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:15.320]   And if I stick to that principle, keep the sermon short,
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.120]   keep the sermon simple and keep it funny,
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.080]   funny like so that people, "Oh, I love it,
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.360]   "I want to hear him again," right?
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.760]   And then keep them coming, right?
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:28.560]   And the church will grow, like in number, it'll grow, right?
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.280]   But all it is doing is attracting
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.880]   nominal people to the church, right?
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.600]   They're gonna have to put in their time anyway,
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.640]   it's just like going to traffic school.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:43.280]   I gotta do it anyway, might as well go to a comedy one.
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.120]   You know what I mean?
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.320]   I have to go to church anyway,
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.920]   might as well go to one that I like the people,
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.000]   and the sermons are short, you know what I mean?
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.400]   And it's encouraging.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:56.400]   So it's not drawing people who wants to meet Christ, right?
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.320]   It's not, so we don't want to have a church
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.200]   where we're drawing people.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.640]   If people are coming because they love Christ
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:08.180]   and that's the primary reason why they come, right?
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.360]   Then yes, it should grow.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.000]   It should grow in the hundreds and thousands
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.360]   and even beyond, right?
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.760]   But only if it's because they're coming to meet Christ.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:21.400]   All right, I'm gonna end it here,
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.800]   and then Pastor Mark is gonna take it over for us.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:26.960]   So this just kinda is,
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.840]   this is the kind of like the pattern that we're gonna have.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.720]   We're gonna teach the core lesson
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.640]   and then the ramification of that in the church.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.360]   And so part of the reason why we're having this class
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:41.160]   is so that we can bring everybody on the same page
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.980]   and realize like, oh, okay, this is why we do what we do.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:49.440]   So next one that we're gonna be covering is the Word.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:53.680]   And we're gonna get into a little bit more of hermeneutics
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.680]   and how to study the Bible.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:57.280]   How do we, if we're going to make it God-centered,
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.080]   like how do we understand what God is saying?
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:02.240]   And again, it may be review for a lot of you,
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:05.800]   but we wanna make sure that not just the elders
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.760]   and the staff is studying the Bible.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.680]   We want the whole church to be able to go into the Word
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.280]   and study it themselves as well.
