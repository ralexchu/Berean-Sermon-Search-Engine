[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:21.300]   I was an orphan lost at the fall, running away,
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300]   but not hear your call.
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300]   Father, you worked your will.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.800]   I had no righteousness of my own.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.300]   I had no right to draw near your throne.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.300]   But Father, you loved me still.
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.300]   And in love before you lay the world's foundation,
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.800]   you breathed death into a dark me as your own.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.800]   You have raised me up so high above my station.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.800]   I'm a child of God by grace and grace alone.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:22.300]   You left your home to seek out the lost.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.800]   You knew the great and terrible cost.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.300]   But Jesus, your face was set.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.800]   I worked my fingers down to the bone.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.800]   Nothing I did would ever return.

[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:51.300]   Hey, class of 2020.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.300]   Roger here.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.300]   By God's grace, you made it this far and you graduated.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.300]   And if some of you aren't graduating yet,
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.300]   don't be anxious about it.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.300]   Before this, you were adults.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.300]   And now you're really adults.
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.300]   But don't worry.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.300]   God has been faithful and he will continue to be.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.300]   Congrats, class of 2020.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.300]   I know that it's been a little bit rough for you guys,
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.300]   but I just wanted to let you know that we're still
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.300]   thinking of you.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.300]   We're praying for you.
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.300]   We love you guys so much and we're so proud.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.300]   Hey, class of 2020.
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.300]   Just your class of 2017 ladies here.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.300]   And we just want to send a little word of encouragement
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.300]   and congrats to you guys as you move forward
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.300]   into your post-grad life.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.300]   So here's a verse, Philippians 1, verse 9.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.300]   "And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.300]   with knowledge and all discernment."
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.300]   "So that you may approve what is excellent
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.300]   and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ."
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.300]   "Filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.300]   through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God."
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.300]   And I hope that this verse would be an encouragement
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.300]   to you guys as you move into post-grad.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.300]   And it is also our prayer for you as you move forward
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.300]   past this really big milestone.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.300]   And 1, 2, 3.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:22.300]   Congratulations, class of 2020.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.300]   Class of 2020, congratulations on graduating.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.300]   It's a bummer we can't come support you guys in person.
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.300]   But just know that we really look forward
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.300]   to seeing you all in band.
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.300]   And for those of you who are going to be moving home,
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.300]   it was great getting to know you guys.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.300]   But really look forward to seeing you guys soon.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.300]   All right, bye.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.300]   Hey, class of 2020.

[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.300]   And it's been awesome getting to know some of you guys
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.300]   during these past four years and serving with some of y'all.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.300]   Just praying that as you guys enter this next transition
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.300]   of life, that you continue to be rooted in Christ
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.300]   and you give Him the glory in all things.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.300]   Congrats once again.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.300]   Hey, class of 2020.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.300]   Congratulations on graduating.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.300]   Woo-hoo.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.300]   Sorry we can't be there with you guys to celebrate.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.300]   But know that we're there in spirit.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.300]   We're just so thankful for you guys.
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.300]   And we love you guys so much and so proud of you.
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.300]   As you guys head on to the next chapter of your lives,
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.300]   just continue to stand firm in the faith and trust in the Lord.
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.300]   He's so good.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.300]   We love you.

[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.300]   that you will pursue the Lord with all your heart
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.300]   and place your hope and identity in Him.

[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.300]   I just want to say that I'm really encouraged of how you guys have been
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.300]   growing spiritually in church as well as just your relationship with the Lord.
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.300]   I just want to encourage you to trust in the Lord during these tough times
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.300]   as well.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.300]   Congratulations, class of 2020 on graduating.
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.300]   I'm thankful to have gotten to know you guys and to see many of you guys grow.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:44.300]   I pray that you continue to seek the Lord wherever he takes you, and we all can
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:51.300]   see you once again.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.300]   Hey, class of 2020.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.300]   This is your seniors.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   Even though you weren't able to have a real graduation, we're all super proud
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.300]   of you.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.300]   It's been great to be able to see the amount of growth and maturation that has
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.300]   been happening over the past three years.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.300]   So from us to you, we all want to encourage you to continue running the race
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.300]   together.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:20.300]   Just here's a couple of verses for encouragement from Hebrews 12, 1 to 2.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.300]   "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.300]   also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and let
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.300]   us run with endurance the race that is set before us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.300]   author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross,
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.300]   despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.300]   Yay!
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.300]   Yay, congrats!
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.300]   Congrats!
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:49.300]   [applause]
