[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.640]   All right, everyone.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.640]   We're going to go into our closing song.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.240]   So why don't we all stand together?
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.720]   [MUSIC - "HOW GREAT THE CHASM"]
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:40.680]   How great the chasm that lay between us.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.640]   How high the mountain I could not climb.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.120]   In desperation, I turned to heaven
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.600]   and spoke your name into the night.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.080]   Then through the darkness, your loving kindness
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.040]   tore through the shadows of my soul.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.520]   The work is finished.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.000]   The end is written.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.480]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:37.440]   Who could imagine so great a mercy?
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.320]   What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.840]   The God of ages stepped down from glory
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.320]   to wear my sin and bear my shame.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.800]   The cross has spoken.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.280]   I am forgiven.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.760]   The King of kings calls me his own.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.760]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   Hallelujah.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.240]   Praise the one who set me free.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.720]   Hallelujah.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.720]   Death has lost its grip on me.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.200]   You have broken every chain.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.680]   There's salvation in your name.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.680]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:04:00.680]   And King of mourning that's filled up from this,
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.160]   your buried body began to breathe.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:15.160]   Out of the silence, the roaring lion declared,
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   the grave has no claim on me.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.640]   Then came the morning.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.120]   Then came the morning that sealed the promise.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.120]   Your buried body began to breathe.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.600]   Out of the silence, the roaring lion declared,
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   the grave has no claim on me.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.080]   Jesus Christ is the victory.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.560]   Oh, hallelujah.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.560]   Praise the one who set me free.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.040]   Hallelujah.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.520]   Death has lost its grip on me.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.040]   You have broken every chain.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.520]   There's salvation in your name.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.480]   Hallelujah.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.960]   Praise the one who set me free.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.480]   Hallelujah.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.960]   Death has lost its grip on me.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.960]   You have broken every chain.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.440]   There's salvation in your name.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:52.400]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.880]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   That's all about our heads in prayer.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.880]   Our God, we are so thankful to you for your sufficient grace
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.880]   and your mercies to us.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.880]   Thank you, God, that we as a church can come together
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.880]   and learn in this way, to hear from your word,
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.880]   to fellowship and be able to encourage each other
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   and be challenged by the practice of the application
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   of faith and seeing faith powerfully move
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.880]   in each one of us.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.880]   I ask, Father God, as tomorrow is Sunday
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.880]   and we come to worship, help us to return
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.880]   to a renewed sense of dedication,
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   a renewed sense of worship and adoration to you,
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.880]   that God, we would render our hearts to you.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.880]   And Lord, it is our prayer that for every single one of us,
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.880]   though each day we have our responsibilities,
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.880]   our work, and our schedules that are full and busy,
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.880]   help us, Father God, to learn what it means
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.880]   to walk with you in such a way.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.880]   We're so cognizant, Lord, of your holiness.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.880]   And God, that we're walking in such a way
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.880]   where we are worshiping you.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.880]   And God, that we're considering you above all things.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.880]   Lord, we thank you, it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.880]   - Amen. - All right.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.880]   We wanna thank all of you guys for coming
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.880]   and definitely wanna thank our team,
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.880]   all the volunteers who put this together.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   So let's give 'em a big round.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.880]   (audience applauding)
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.880]   Thank you guys for leading praise.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   Just as a quick note, as Kevin mentioned,
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   we do need just some help.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.880]   For those of you guys who just like things to be straight,
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.880]   some of our chairs right now, as you can tell,
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.880]   kinda got shifted around and stuff,
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.880]   so please help us set up for Sunday.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.880]   And then we just need helping hands,
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.880]   make sure we're bringing the white chairs and tables
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.880]   back into the sanctuary and the racks.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.880]   So thanks for your help, have a good night, everyone.
