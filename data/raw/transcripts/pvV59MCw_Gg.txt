[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   I wanna welcome you all to this morning's service,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   and particularly if you're brand new to the church,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   we wanna welcome you and ask that after the service,
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.720]   please visit us over at our welcome booth
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   in the parking lot.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   We'd love to meet you, answer any questions you may have,
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.720]   and give you more information about the church.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.720]   I wanna highlight a few of our announcements
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.720]   for the upcoming weeks.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.720]   Importantly for all of the members,
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   please make sure you note that Sunday, the 21st,
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   is a full Sunday with a fundraiser lunch
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.720]   that's going to be supporting our summer admissions team,
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   and then after the lunch at 2 p.m.,
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.720]   we'll be having our members meeting.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   If you cannot make it, please go either to the web or the app.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.720]   There's a quick absence form,
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.720]   and just let us know what's happening.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.720]   Please also note that after the members meeting,
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.720]   there's gonna be a service fair,
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.720]   and we want everybody to stick around for that,
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.720]   find out what's happening in different teams,
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.720]   and also sign up for volunteer opportunities.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.720]   With that said, I wanna highlight that on Saturday, the 20th,
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.720]   for the FAM245, that's the group of more recently marrieds,
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.720]   there is a workshop taking place at 10.30 in the Sprouts Room,
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.720]   so please make sure to participate in that.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.720]   The other thing is for the whole church,
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.720]   on Friday, April the 26th, will be praise and prayer.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.720]   There will be no Bible study that week,
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.720]   for those of you who are newer.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.720]   That service starts at 7.30,
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.720]   and we hope that all of you will be there,
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.720]   participating in that time of praise and prayer.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.720]   The last thing I'm gonna mention is that,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.720]   please save the date.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   In the summer, August 16th through the 18th,
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   there is a family ministry summer retreat.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.720]   We're excited to have Dr. John Street back with us
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   for that summertime, where he'll be preaching
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.720]   on the subject of God's design for our marriages.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.720]   So please make sure to save the date,
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.720]   mark your calendar so that when the registration comes out,
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.720]   you can participate.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.720]   Today, after our worship time,
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.720]   we're gonna be having our brother Jeremiah be baptized,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   and we'll be able to hear his testimony
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.720]   and fellowship that way.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.720]   At this time, we'll do our time of offering.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.720]   If you have a physical check,
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   the box is right by the entrance.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.720]   Otherwise, we can submit our offering digitally.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.720]   Let's take a moment to pray together.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.720]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   for your incredible grace.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   What a privilege it is for us to come together,
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.720]   God, in fellowship and in worship,
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.720]   lifting up our songs of praise to you.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.720]   We pray, Father God, that you would bless us thoroughly.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   What's more, God, we ask that by the joining of our faith,
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   we will grow, we will continue to mature,
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.720]   and in so doing, we would love and honor you.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.720]   We pray, Father God, that in our offering,
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   it would be an expression of our desire
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   to really lift you up and devote ourselves to you.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   We ask, God, that you would continue to bless the ministry,
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.720]   that it would be about your kingdom,
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.720]   that it would be about you, Lord.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   We thank you for this time.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.720]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   [music]
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   [music]
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   At this time, would you please rise
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.720]   and take a moment to say hello to your neighbor,
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:23.720]   and we will continue our worship.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:37.720]   [music]
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.720]   A praise.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   A praise and glorify our God,
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   the Father of our Lord.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.720]   In Christ he has in heavenly realms
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   his blessings on us all.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   For pure and blameless in his sight,
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.720]   he destined us to be.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   And now we've been adopted through his Son eternally.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   To the praise of your glory,
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.720]   to the praise of your mercy and grace.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   To the praise of your glory,
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:33.720]   you are the God we sing.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.720]   A praise.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.720]   A praise and glorify our God,
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.720]   who gives his grace in Christ.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.720]   In him our sins are washed away,
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.720]   redeemed through sacrifice.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   In him God has known to us
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.720]   the mystery of his will.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.720]   That Christ should be the head of all,
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   his purpose to be.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   To the praise.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.720]   To the praise of your glory,
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.720]   to the praise of your mercy and grace.

[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   A praise and glorify.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   A praise and glorify our God,

[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.720]   Hello, my name is Jeremiah Yong,
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.720]   and this is my testimony.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.720]   For my entire life,
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.720]   I have grown up surrounded
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.720]   by an amazing,
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   slightly chaotic,
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.720]   God-fearing family,
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.720]   memorizing verses,
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.720]   reading the Bible,
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.720]   attending church,
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.720]   and giving testimonies
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   like this one.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.720]   I remember the first time
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.720]   I claimed to trust in Christ
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.720]   as my Savior when I was 11.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.720]   This, however,
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   wasn't a sincere confession
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.720]   to die to the old self
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.720]   and put on the new.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   I only desired to follow
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   in my friends' footsteps
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   of announcing their faith
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.720]   in Jesus.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   My dad is a pastor,
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   which led to a lot of church moving
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.720]   and few Christian friends.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.720]   As I grew older,
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.720]   this began to stir up resentment.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.720]   My siblings all had friends
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.720]   their age,
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.720]   and my parents seemed to have
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   all the grown-ups,
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.720]   so why didn't I get to hang out
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.720]   with anyone?
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.720]   Why wasn't there anybody
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   for me to talk to
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   or confide in?
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.720]   More often than not,
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.720]   I felt left out,
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.720]   angry at my parents,
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   and more importantly,
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   at God.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   Instead of going to church
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.720]   in order to glorify and honor
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.720]   and praise the God
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.720]   of the universe,
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.720]   my Creator,
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   I saw church and Christianity
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.720]   as a way to satisfy
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.720]   my earthly needs.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.720]   When we made the switch
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.720]   to another church,
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   this led to even further resentment
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   on my part,
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   and I did everything I could
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.720]   to drag my feet
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.720]   by being silent
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   when asked to speak
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.720]   and participating in things
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.720]   with a bad attitude.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   I viewed Sunday school
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.720]   as boring and trivial,
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.720]   talking about things
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.720]   that I had already heard
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.720]   a hundred times over.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.720]   Bitter,
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.720]   I stopped reading the Bible
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.720]   and began obsessing
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.720]   over the legality of my actions,
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.720]   seeing how close
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.720]   I could get to sinning
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   without technically breaking the law
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   in my words,
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   relationships,
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.720]   and actions.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.720]   In hindsight,
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   it was clear that I was drowning
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   in selfishness,
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   refusing God.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   I was trying to justify myself
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.720]   on my own
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   with my actions and deeds
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.720]   rather than genuine faith.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.720]   I was seeking to answer
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.720]   the question,
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.720]   "How can God serve me?"
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   rather than,
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.720]   "How can I glorify God?"
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.720]   Eventually,
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.720]   one of the youth leaders
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.720]   must have noticed
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.720]   my pity parties,
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.720]   and he invited me out
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.720]   to lunch to talk.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   There, he asked me the question,
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.720]   "If you were to die tonight,
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.720]   how certain would you be
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.720]   that you would go to heaven?"
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.720]   I answered, "Eighty percent,
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.720]   but I know that
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.720]   it is all because of God.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.720]   The other twenty percent
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   is just me being indecisive."
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.720]   Looking back,
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   it was at this moment
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.720]   that I began to question
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   the intent behind my actions
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.720]   and my salvation as a whole.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   My answer to that question
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.720]   revealed that I had not
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   put my faith in God.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   Despite giving
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   the pastor's kid answer
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.720]   that I could contribute
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   nothing to my salvation,
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   I never truly believed that.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   This experience began
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.720]   to lead me on the slow
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   and steady path of conviction,
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.720]   but it wasn't until
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.720]   early in my senior year
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   of high school
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.720]   that I truly gave my life
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.720]   to Christ.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.720]   Along with the culmination
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.720]   of stress,
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.720]   failing friendships,
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.720]   and self-reflection,
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   it dawned on me
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.720]   that I couldn't answer
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.720]   the question,
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   "Why do you go to church?"
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   Were these actions
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   I called faith really genuine?
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.720]   Or were they merely a shell,
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.720]   displaying morality
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.720]   on the outside,
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.720]   yet hollow inside?
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.720]   As the realization
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   of my own selfishness
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.720]   and hypocrisy
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.720]   began boiling up,
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.720]   I remember calling
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.720]   a youth leader in tears,
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.720]   asking for help.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.720]   On that day,
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.720]   I realized that none of my works,
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.720]   no matter how great or good,
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   could contribute to my salvation.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.720]   Even where I tried my best
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.720]   to succeed,
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.720]   I had ended up failing.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.720]   God truly was,
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   and is,
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   the only one
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.720]   who can save me
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.720]   from my wretched state.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   There was nothing else
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.720]   I could turn to,
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.720]   no people,
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.720]   no course of action
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   to cleanse me from my sin.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.720]   Sitting on the side
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   of the road there,
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.720]   I turned to Him
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   and truly placed
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.720]   my faith in Christ.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.720]   Fast forward to now,
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.720]   I have only barely begun
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.720]   to scratch the surface
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.720]   of who God is.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.720]   Yet I have been
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.720]   so incredibly encouraged,
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.720]   as prayers have been answered,
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.720]   and I find more and more
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   in the richness
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.720]   of His word and character.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.720]   Now I understand
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.720]   that I go to church,
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.720]   and furthermore,
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.720]   do everything
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.720]   in order to glorify Him.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   While I still struggle
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.720]   with my inability
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.720]   to follow the law,
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   as well as my depraved,
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   sinful nature,
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   instead of living
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   a Pharisaic life,
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   I find myself back
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   before the cross
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.720]   each and every day,
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.720]   for I cannot live without Him.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   I have been crucified
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.720]   with Christ.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.720]   It is no longer I who live,
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   but Christ who lives in me.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.720]   And the life
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.720]   I now live in the flesh,
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.720]   I live by faith
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.720]   in the Son of God,
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.720]   who loved me
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   and gave Himself for me.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   Thank you.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   (applause)
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   Thank you, Jeremiah,
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.720]   for that encouraging testimony.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   Jeremiah, do you understand
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.720]   that by this baptism,
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.720]   as you enter into the water,
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   you express your union
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   with Christ in His death,
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.720]   and when you come out of the water,
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.720]   you express your union
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   with Christ in His resurrected life?
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.720]   I baptize you now
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.720]   in the name of the Father,
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.720]   of the Son,
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.720]   and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   (applause)
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   Amen.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   Well, we are encouraged
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   by your testimony.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   Thank you for sharing it.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.720]   If you would now all
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.720]   take your Bible
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.720]   over to James 1:26.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.720]   James 1:26.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.720]   We are taking a break
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   from Luke and jumping
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   into this topic
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.720]   that I've entitled the sermon
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.720]   A Glorious Impartiality,
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.720]   something that we may not
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.720]   think about frequently,
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.720]   but something that is
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.720]   a glorious character trait
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   of our God.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.720]   So let's take a look
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   at James 1:26.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.720]   The scripture says this,
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.720]   "If anyone thinks himself
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.720]   to be religious,
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.720]   and yet does not bridle
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   his tongue,
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   but deceives his own heart,
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.720]   this man's religion
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.720]   is worthless.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.720]   Pure and undisfiled religion
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.720]   in the sight of our God
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.720]   and Father is this,
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.720]   to visit orphans and widows
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.720]   in their distress
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   and to keep oneself
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.720]   unstained by the world."
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.720]   Chapter 2, verse 1,
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.720]   "My brethren,
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.720]   do not hold your faith
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.720]   in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.720]   with an attitude
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   of personal favoritism."
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.720]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.720]   Heavenly Father,
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.720]   we ask now for your blessing,
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.720]   a spiritual blessing, God,
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.720]   of conviction,
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   understanding of your instruction,
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.720]   but also a kind of belief
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   that moves us,
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.720]   changes our attitude,
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.720]   changes also the way we see.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.720]   So we ask, God,
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.720]   that you would lead us
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   in Christ's name.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   Amen.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.720]   I want to ask you
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.720]   quite an interesting
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.720]   and a little bit
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   uncomfortable question,
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.720]   which is,
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.720]   in the Bible,
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   who does Jesus hate most?
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.720]   It's a weird question to ask,
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.720]   I know.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.720]   Take a moment to think about it.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.720]   When you think about
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.720]   the biblical passages,
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.720]   the person that Jesus,
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.720]   or the people that Jesus
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.720]   gives his most scathing rebuke
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.720]   are typically false leaders, right?
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.720]   But then when you think about
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.720]   what he says to them,
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.720]   what he reprimands
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.720]   is their hypocrisy,
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.720]   that they would have
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.720]   the outer shell
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.720]   of being this well-washed,
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.720]   white, you know, presentation,
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.720]   but inside you're just decaying.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720]   There's emptiness,
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.720]   there's worthlessness,
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.720]   and as a matter of fact,
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.720]   it's filled with all kinds
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.720]   of greed, ungodliness,
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.720]   selfishness, and pride.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.720]   And then he points at them
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.720]   and says, "Woe to you
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.720]   "because you're gonna be judged
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.720]   "very, very severely
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.720]   "for your fakeness,"
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.720]   'cause you're phonies, right?
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.720]   He doesn't hold back his words,
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.720]   and he's so sharp with them.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.720]   Now, I bring this up
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.720]   because in this passage
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.720]   in the book of James,
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.720]   James tries to tell us
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   there is a kind of religion
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.720]   that is so fake.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.720]   You say that you love people,
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.720]   and then you won't even
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.720]   love the orphan,
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.720]   you won't even love the widow.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.720]   You say that you worship
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.720]   a holy God,
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.720]   but you have no restraint
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.720]   over your tongue.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.720]   You say whatever you want,
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.720]   and you're vile.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.720]   This is worthless.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.720]   You're fake.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.720]   But then on top of this,
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.720]   a primary thing
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.720]   that he highlights is,
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.720]   and you practice favoritism,
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.720]   which I thought,
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.720]   wow, that's really interesting.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.720]   So today we're gonna take
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.720]   a moment to look and examine
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.720]   in our own hearts
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.720]   and our own lives,
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.720]   is there a pattern
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.720]   of partiality
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.720]   where we favor certain people,
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.720]   we look at certain people,
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.720]   and we give them honor
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.720]   and respect
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.720]   that we won't give people
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.720]   that we think are beneath us.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.720]   And I do think the scripture
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.720]   will tell us many, many times
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.720]   that we as people of this world
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.720]   are so prone
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.720]   to judge by first appearances, right?
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.720]   God said it himself,
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.720]   that you judge from the external,
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.720]   I judge the heart.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.720]   Now we tend to judge
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.720]   based on community judgments,
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.720]   like I may not even know,
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.720]   but so long as the group
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.720]   thinks so, it is.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.720]   And so in that way,
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.720]   scripture is gonna tell us,
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   I don't want you to speak
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.720]   and judge like the world does,
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.720]   where it's so external
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.720]   and fleshly and superficial.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.720]   But at the same time,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   if I look deeper into my own heart,
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.720]   not only is there a pressure
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.720]   from the outside,
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.720]   I guess the way the world
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.720]   does things,
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.720]   but there is a pressure
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.720]   from the inside.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.720]   Because ultimately,
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.720]   there is a desire
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.720]   and ambition in my heart.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   I want to actually excel
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.720]   in those superficial games.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.720]   I want to be better looking.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.720]   I want to be taller.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.720]   Honest to God,
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.720]   I want to be a little bit taller.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.720]   I want to be more educated.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   I want to be better,
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.720]   more skilled, more respected,
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.720]   have X, Y, and Z.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.720]   And in that way,
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   my own internal ambitions
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.720]   feed the superficial,
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.720]   partial, very, very evil thing.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.720]   And what the word of God
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.720]   is gonna tell us,
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.720]   is that this fleshly attitude
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.720]   must not be in our faith.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.720]   And so, James chapter 2, verse 1,
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.720]   gives us this point in exhortation.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   My brethren,
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.720]   do not hold your faith
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.720]   in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.720]   with an attitude
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.720]   of personal favoritism.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.720]   And to be clear,
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.720]   it is always because
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.720]   our Heavenly Father
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.720]   is so different from the world.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.720]   Amen?
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.720]   Our God, His character is holy.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.720]   It's consistent.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.720]   And it's gloriously impartial.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.720]   And that's what we're gonna be looking at today.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   As a first point,
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.720]   we do have to take time
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.720]   to make sure we understand this sin.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   Yes, it's pretty straightforward,
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.720]   but the Scripture reveals to us
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.720]   both the external,
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   the pattern,
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.720]   the behavior,
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.720]   and the internal desire.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   So take a moment with me
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.720]   to look at James chapter 2, verse 1,
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.720]   down to verse 3,
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.720]   and this is what it says.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.720]   My brethren,
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.720]   do not hold your faith
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.720]   in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.720]   with an attitude
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   of personal favoritism.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.720]   For if a man comes
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   into your assembly
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.720]   with a gold ring
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   and dressed in fine clothes,
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.720]   and there also comes
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.720]   in a poor man
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   in dirty clothes,
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.720]   and you,
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.720]   you pay special attention
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.720]   to the one
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.720]   who is wearing the fine clothes
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   and say,
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.720]   "You sit here in a good place,"
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.720]   and you say to the poor man,
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:50.720]   "You stand there
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.720]   or sit down by my footstool,"
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   have you not made distinctions
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.720]   among yourselves
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.720]   and become judges
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.720]   with evil motives?
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.720]   So as a first point,
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.720]   we're going to identify
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.720]   the elements of our partiality,
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.720]   but if you think about it,
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.720]   he wants you to actually imagine.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.720]   I love it
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.720]   when the Scriptures gives us
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   like this hypothetical example,
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.720]   and he says,
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.720]   "I want you to imagine
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.720]   "here at church at Berean,
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.720]   "you have somebody
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.720]   "who is very clearly wealthy."
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.720]   You know, back then,
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.720]   people would wear rings
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.720]   on every single finger
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.720]   in order to show like,
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.720]   "I am the boss," right?
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.720]   Their show of wealth
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.720]   was incredible,
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.720]   and what's more,
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.720]   it says he was dressed
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.720]   in this fine clothes,
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   and today, essentially,
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.720]   it would be like
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.720]   somebody walking in
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.720]   with like a $15,000 suit.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.720]   He's got a huge Rolex,
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.720]   maybe a big chain,
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.720]   drives up in a Porsche,
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   whatever you want to imagine.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.720]   He's here, okay?
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.720]   He's here at church,
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.720]   but then there's this other man
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.720]   who you can immediately tell,
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.720]   "This man is in poverty.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.720]   "His clothes are raggedy."
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.720]   Now, what's really interesting
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.720]   is today I want to highlight
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.720]   this idea what we're getting at
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.720]   is the judgment of how we categorize
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.720]   and assess people.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.720]   Who is the sinner here, right?
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.720]   What's interesting is
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.720]   we live in a generation
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.720]   where automatically
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.720]   the masses will say,
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.720]   "I know who's the sinner,
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.720]   "the guy who drove up in a Porsche.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:09.720]   "How dare he show up at church
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.720]   "all blinged out like that."
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.720]   Why?
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:13.720]   Because obviously,
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.720]   wealthy people are their oppressors.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.720]   No, that's not what
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   this passage is saying.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.720]   Now, is it fair that somebody
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.720]   is making like 400, 500 times
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.720]   more than the other person?
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.720]   That's for another discussion.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.720]   But the sin lies not in the heart
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.720]   of the rich man,
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   nor even of the poor man,
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   but the sin lies in the church member
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   who came in and said,
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.720]   "Whoa, look at that.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.720]   "Look at him."
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.720]   And said, "Whoa, come over here.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   "We've got a special seat
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.720]   "right up in the front for you."
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.720]   Right?
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.720]   The sin is in the heart
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.720]   of the individual
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.720]   who made distinction.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.720]   Now, by way of just pure definition,
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.720]   in verse 1 where it says,
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.720]   "Do not have this attitude
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.720]   "of personal favoritism,"
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.720]   that word is just one long word
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   that literally means
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.720]   receiving faces,
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.720]   meaning you are judging
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.720]   purely on the face of a man.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.720]   Right?
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.720]   In another way, in our idiom,
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.720]   the way we would say it is
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.720]   we're respecters of people.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.720]   Why?
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.720]   Because we see beauty,
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.720]   we see title,
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.720]   we see wealth,
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.720]   and then we say,
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.720]   "You deserve my respect."
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.720]   Right?
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.720]   "You're worthy in my eyes."
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.720]   And that's at the heart of the sin.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.720]   And in this illustration,
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.720]   what we're seeing is
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.720]   the person who is the church member
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.720]   is impressed with all that.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.720]   "I'm impressed with your wings.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.720]   "I'm impressed with your car."
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.720]   And so I want to ask you this question.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.720]   Do you have any element
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   of this kind of immediate superficial respect
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.720]   for the things on the outside?
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.720]   Now, just as a caveat,
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.720]   please know that, again,
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.720]   I believe this generation,
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.720]   every generation, actually,
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.720]   has a lot of perverse thinking.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.720]   One of the ways that sounds good
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   but is not true
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.720]   is that you have to treat
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.720]   every single person equally
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   and that each person
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   actually should be equal
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.720]   in respect to how they're treated
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.720]   at all times.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   Now, it sounds good
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.720]   because it's a general principle,
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.720]   but no, I respect my elders
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.720]   and you should too.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.720]   It's biblical.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.720]   It's not just a culture thing.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.720]   Scripture says, "Stand up for the aged."
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.720]   Right?
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.720]   You should show respect for the elders.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.720]   What's more,
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   people are in positions and titles
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:29.720]   like of authority.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.720]   Romans chapter 13,
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.720]   if somebody is an official,
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.720]   if somebody is a governor,
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.720]   you give them the respect.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.720]   You give them due submission.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.720]   What's more, Scripture even says,
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.720]   if there are people in your lives
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.720]   who are laboring over you,
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.720]   preaching, teaching, guiding,
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.720]   and shepherding your heart,
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.720]   they're worthy of double honor.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.720]   Right?
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.720]   So, is it the case
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   that you have to do
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.720]   exact same thing
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.720]   to every single person
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   in every single way?
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.720]   No, that's not what he's getting at.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.720]   The idea is,
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.720]   what are you actually impressed by?
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.720]   Do you honor what God honors?
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.720]   Or, we're talking today
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.720]   about a kind of judgment or eyes
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.720]   that's stained by the world.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.720]   Do you honor and impress
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.720]   by the things
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.720]   that the world honors?
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.720]   Does it look just like the world?
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.720]   And so, I ask you
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.720]   this applicational question.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   Do you see any pattern
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.720]   of partiality in your heart?
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.720]   And maybe another, again,
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.720]   kind of uncomfortable question is,
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   do we see any pattern
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.720]   of partiality in the church?
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   Well, we have a pattern
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.720]   of honoring the professionals,
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.720]   honoring the people who are,
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.720]   you know, the experts in fields
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.720]   and people who are highly educated,
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.720]   you know.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.720]   Now, as I ask that question,
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.720]   I want to just answer and say,
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.720]   we don't want to be judgmental.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   If you're like, oh, shoot,
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.720]   like the other day,
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.720]   I did, you know,
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.720]   call somebody Dr. So-and-so.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.720]   You know what?
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.720]   Don't feel bad about that.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.720]   I'm not judging you.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.720]   Why?
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.720]   Because you know this passage
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.720]   is primarily getting at the heart.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.720]   That in the heart, he says,
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.720]   didn't you become a judge
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.720]   with what?
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.720]   Evil motives.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.720]   It's right there in your ideology.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.720]   It's in your eye,
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.720]   and it's in your heart.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.720]   Now, what he says is,
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.720]   first and foremost,
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.720]   that the sin of this
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.720]   is one of arrogance
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.720]   because what he points out
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.720]   is that you've put yourself
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.720]   in a place of judgment.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.720]   You are making distinction
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.720]   amongst people,
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.720]   judging people as worthy
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.720]   and unworthy.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.720]   Who made you judge?
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.720]   Who gave you the authority
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.720]   to categorize people like that?
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.720]   That's where part of the sin is.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.720]   When you practice a favoritism
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.720]   or partiality amongst people,
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.720]   whatever category you're using,
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.720]   it ends up judging you,
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.720]   and therefore, immediately,
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:51.720]   you're guilty of a lot of things.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.720]   You're guilty of not only
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.720]   the favoritism,
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.720]   but of arrogance,
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.720]   snobbery, right,
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.720]   and often injustice.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.720]   And what's more,
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.720]   what he gets at is,
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.720]   he asks the question,
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   what is in your heart
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.720]   and what is your motive
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.720]   that you would show
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.720]   these individuals
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.720]   this kind of undue respect?
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.720]   That you would treat them with,
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.720]   "Hey, come over here,"
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.720]   and then you would treat
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.720]   the other guy with like,
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.720]   "You know what?
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.720]   "Just say whatever.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.720]   "On my feet, on the ground,
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.720]   "whatever, I don't care."
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.720]   What is in your heart
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.720]   that does that?
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.720]   And then sometimes I ask myself
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.720]   literally the question,
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.720]   what is in my heart
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.720]   that I find in myself?
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.720]   There are some times
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.720]   when I'm in my own
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.720]   just kind of overestimation
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.720]   of my courage.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.720]   Like, you know,
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.720]   I'm not a respecter of people,
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.720]   but if I meet somebody
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.720]   who is like a CEO
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.720]   of a big old company,
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.720]   I find in myself,
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.720]   in my heart, fear.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.720]   Why do I give reverence
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   and fear to somebody
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.720]   who has title,
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   but to the person who doesn't?
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.720]   It's like, "Eh, what's up, man?"
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.720]   Right?
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.720]   Why?
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.720]   As we do this,
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.720]   the passage is telling us,
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.720]   God doesn't see this as,
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.720]   "Ah, every culture does it."
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.720]   God doesn't see this as,
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.720]   "This is just the way
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.720]   "that society is."
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.720]   Every time we have
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.720]   a bunch of people,
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.720]   you kind of get
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.720]   into a hierarchy.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   He sees it as evil.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.720]   Right?
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.720]   He sees it as evil.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.720]   And so I wanted to show
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.720]   that yes, there are elements
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   by way in which we show
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.720]   this kind of desire,
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.720]   and we have various categories
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.720]   about career, education,
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.720]   just skill set,
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.720]   and then external beauty
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.720]   in which we show favoritism.
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.720]   God sees it as evil.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.720]   Going to point number two,
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.720]   we have to ask the question,
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.720]   why does God see it
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.720]   as such evil?
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.720]   Right?
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.720]   When he says that there's
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.720]   this evil motive in your heart,
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.720]   did you know,
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.720]   you know the New Testament
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   language is so robust.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.720]   There are different terms
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:50.720]   for evil.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.720]   Right?
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.720]   There's just bad, kakos.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.720]   There are terms
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.720]   of transgression.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.720]   There's terms that call
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.720]   for basically lawlessness,
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:58.720]   and sometimes even
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.720]   straight mistake.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.720]   Sometimes you're just
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.720]   missing the mark.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.720]   Right?
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.720]   But this word is a word
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.720]   that is translated
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.720]   more so perversion
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.720]   or even pornography.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   Why?
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.720]   Well, we know it's because
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.720]   it is incongruent.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.720]   It is in opposition
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:14.720]   with the holy character
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.720]   of our God.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.720]   Point number two is
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.720]   we need to take a long look
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.720]   at God's glorious,
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.720]   impartial character.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.720]   Okay?
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.720]   And we want to give glory
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.720]   for that.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.720]   We want to understand
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.720]   how God works,
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.720]   how God operates,
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.720]   and how that is to
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.720]   his great excellence.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.720]   Turn your Bible over
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.720]   to Deuteronomy 10, verse 17.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.720]   For this point,
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.720]   we're going to walk through
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.720]   some really important passages,
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.720]   and this is what
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.720]   the scripture says.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:42.720]   Deuteronomy 10, 17.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.720]   "For the Lord your God
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.720]   is the God of gods
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.720]   and the Lord of lords,
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.720]   the great, the mighty,
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.720]   the awesome God,
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   who does not show partiality
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.720]   nor take a bribe."
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.720]   Now, pause there.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.720]   I was really shocked by this
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.720]   because when you think of
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.720]   the mighty God,
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.720]   the one who has power,
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.720]   maybe even when you think
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.720]   of Jesus Christ,
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.720]   who's going to come to judge
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.720]   with a mighty sword
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.720]   coming out of his mouth,
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.720]   he has eyes blazing fire,
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.720]   he's riding on a horse,
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.720]   and he has a scepter
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   in his right hand,
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   he's going to crush the nations.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.720]   You're not thinking,
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.720]   "Yeah, and you know what?
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.720]   He's impartial."
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.720]   Right?
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.720]   "He's pretty fair."
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.720]   Right?
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.720]   Like, that's not
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.720]   what you're thinking.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.720]   Notice how the fact
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.720]   that he doesn't take a bribe
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.720]   from anybody
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.720]   is to his glory.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.720]   And what's more,
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.720]   he essentially says
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.720]   that in this passage
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.720]   of Deuteronomy,
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.720]   verse 18,
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.720]   "He executes justice
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.720]   for the orphan,
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.720]   the widow,
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.720]   and shows his love
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.720]   even for the alien
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.720]   by giving him food
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.720]   and clothing."
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.720]   So show your love
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.720]   for the alien
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.720]   for you are aliens
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.720]   in the land of Egypt.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.720]   You know what I've been seeing
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.720]   a lot on the internet recently?
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:51.720]   And maybe it's just because
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:52.720]   all the sports
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.720]   are starting to get,
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.720]   you know,
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.720]   either ready
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.720]   or in full force.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.720]   So I've been seeing
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.720]   a lot of videos
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   of botched calls
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.720]   in the NBA
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.720]   where the referee is like,
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.720]   "Technical on you.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.720]   Technical on you."
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.720]   You know?
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.720]   Because they're arrogant
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.720]   and sometimes they get mad.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.720]   Or they call a foul
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.720]   and you're like,
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.720]   "Oh my goodness.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:10.720]   You just ruined the game."
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:11.720]   Right?
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:12.720]   Because recently
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.720]   in March Madness,
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.720]   all that kind of stuff happened.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.720]   Or you know what's even worse?
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.720]   In baseball,
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.720]   you have people
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.720]   getting in people's faces
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.720]   and screaming and yelling.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.720]   You know what's
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.720]   the worst kind of referee?
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.720]   Right?
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.720]   Obviously they're human.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.720]   They miss calls.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.720]   One of the worst kinds
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:29.720]   are people who are
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.720]   easily manipulated.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.720]   You know?
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.720]   A superstar,
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.720]   a basketball player
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.720]   comes up in a referee's face
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.720]   and just starts screaming,
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.720]   crying,
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   complaining,
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.720]   and the referee's like,
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.720]   "Yeah, we need to change that up."
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.720]   Can you imagine
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.720]   how angry you would be
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.720]   if a referee
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.720]   was so easily manipulated
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.720]   by complaints and whiners?
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.720]   Or he was a respecter of persons like,
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:52.720]   "Oh, LeBron said so."
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.720]   Right?
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.720]   Like it would be
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.720]   just completely flabbergasting.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.720]   Like, "Are you serious?
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.720]   You don't, what,
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.720]   deserve to be there.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.720]   Should be fired today."
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.720]   That's how we would feel.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.720]   Praise God He is not
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.720]   a respecter of people
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.720]   scared or manipulated.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.720]   Another passage,
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.720]   Romans chapter 2
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.720]   verse 9 through 11.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:14.720]   Romans chapter 2
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.720]   verse 9 through 11
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.720]   it says,
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.720]   "There will be tribulation
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.720]   and distress
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.720]   for every soul of man
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:21.720]   who does evil,
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.720]   of the Jew first
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.720]   and also of the Greek.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.720]   But glory, honor, peace
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.720]   to everyone who does good,
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:28.720]   to the Jew first
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.720]   and also to the Greek.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.720]   For there is no partiality
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.720]   with God."
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.720]   You see that?
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.720]   He's talking about His justice
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.720]   and His mercy,
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.720]   His rewarding,
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.720]   and He says at the end of that,
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.720]   "God is impartial."
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:44.720]   Right?
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.720]   And we know that
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.720]   that is the foundation
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:47.720]   by which we're supposed
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:48.720]   to do everything,
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.720]   just like you know
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.720]   you're supposed to love,
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.720]   just like you know
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:52.720]   you're supposed to forgive.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.720]   Likewise, God expects
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.720]   in the same way
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.720]   that you express impartiality.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.720]   Now, what's really interesting
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.720]   about this is He talks about
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.720]   both Jew and Greek,
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.720]   and someone might say,
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.720]   "Hey, wait a minute.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.720]   Not show favoritism.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.720]   God chose the nation of Israel,
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.720]   the Jews.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.720]   A precious apple of His eye.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.720]   What do you mean
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.720]   He shows no favoritism?"
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.720]   But understand this.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.720]   God's show of mercy
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.720]   is His choice,
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.720]   but He never, ever once,
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.720]   and He never will,
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.720]   be like, "Since you're
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.720]   the apple of my eye,
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.720]   that's okay.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.720]   You're not going to get judged.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.720]   I know you did a bad thing,
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.720]   but no insult."
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.720]   Right?
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:35.720]   Like He's not going to be
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.720]   that kind of parent.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.720]   But instead, think about this.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:40.720]   Because they are
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.720]   the apple of His eye,
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.720]   who gets judged first?
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:50.720]   Who gets examined first?
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.720]   Who is forced to come
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.720]   to a reckoning?
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:54.720]   And so you think about this,
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.720]   and God still is just and holy.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.720]   Here's another passage,
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:45:59.720]   Ephesians chapter 6,
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.720]   verse 5 through 9,
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.720]   and I want to highlight this
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.720]   because as I say that,
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:05.720]   God is so impartial,
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.720]   He does not give you a pass
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.720]   just because you suffered a lot.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.720]   He doesn't give you a pass
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:12.720]   just because, you know,
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:13.720]   we got to understand context,
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:14.720]   and we got to understand history.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.720]   No.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.720]   His judgment is firm,
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:19.720]   it's exacting,
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.720]   and it's always impartial.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.720]   In Ephesians chapter 6,
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.720]   He speaks to slaves.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.720]   He speaks to slaves and masters.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.720]   And this is what He says,
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:32.720]   "Slaves, be obedient to those
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:33.720]   who are your masters
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.720]   according to the flesh,
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.720]   with fear and trembling,
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.720]   in the sincerity of your heart
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.720]   as to Christ,
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.720]   not by way of eye service,
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.720]   as men-pleasers,
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:42.720]   but as slaves of Christ,
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:43.720]   doing the will of God
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:44.720]   from the heart.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:45.720]   With good will,
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.720]   render service as to the Lord
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:48.720]   and not to men,
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.720]   knowing that whatever good thing
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.720]   each one does,
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:52.720]   this he will receive back
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:53.720]   from the Lord
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:54.720]   whether slave or free."
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:55.720]   And so in other passages,
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.720]   like Colossians,
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.720]   He says,
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.720]   "Don't just show goodness
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:46:59.720]   to the good masters,
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.720]   even to the bad ones."
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.720]   And then in verse 9,
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.720]   He says, "Masters,
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.720]   do the same thing to them
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.720]   and give up threatening,
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.720]   knowing that both their master
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.720]   and yours is in heaven,
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.720]   and there is no partiality
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.720]   with him."
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.720]   It goes both ways.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:17.720]   God doesn't show partiality
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.720]   to the rich
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.720]   because God needs nothing
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.720]   from the rich.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.720]   They offer Him nothing.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.720]   Everything they have
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.720]   is by the mercy of His hand,
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:31.720]   but also to the poor.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.720]   God is not a respecter,
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.720]   and He doesn't even give
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.720]   partiality to the poor.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.720]   Leviticus chapter 19,
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.720]   verse 5 through 18.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.720]   Leviticus 19, 15 through 18.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.720]   Chapter 19, verse 15 through 18.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.720]   "You shall do no injustice
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:49.720]   in judgment.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.720]   You shall not be partial
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.720]   to the poor
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:52.720]   nor defer to the great,
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:53.720]   but you are to judge
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.720]   your neighbor fairly."
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:56.720]   See that?
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.720]   It goes both directions.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:58.720]   It's like,
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.720]   "Ah, you know, the poor
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:00.720]   and grew up..."
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.720]   Let's just turn a blind eye
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.720]   to the stuff He does.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:03.720]   No.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.720]   Verse 16,
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.720]   "You shall not go about
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.720]   as a slander among your people,
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:08.720]   and you are not to act
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.720]   against the life
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.720]   of your neighbor.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.720]   I am the Lord.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.720]   You shall not hate
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:13.720]   your fellow countrymen
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.720]   in your heart.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.720]   You may surely reprove
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.720]   your neighbor,
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:18.720]   but shall not incur sin
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.720]   because of him.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.720]   You shall not take vengeance
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.720]   nor bear any grudge
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:22.720]   against the sons
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:23.720]   of your people,
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:24.720]   but you shall love
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.720]   your neighbor as yourself.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.720]   I am the Lord."
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.720]   Amen.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:32.720]   I want us to think about,
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:33.720]   in the book of James,
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:34.720]   He was saying
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.720]   there's a huge contrast
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.720]   between you being stained
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.720]   by the ideology
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.720]   and the practice
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.720]   of the world
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.720]   versus how God operates.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.720]   Praise God
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.720]   that He is not like
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.720]   any of them.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:47.720]   He's not moved.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:48.720]   He's not bribed.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.720]   He's not manipulated.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.720]   He's not coerced.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.720]   He's not on a whim,
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   but it's just and fair,
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:55.720]   and that's why
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.720]   we can have the confidence
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.720]   that even if you're
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:58.720]   a poor, poor orphan
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.720]   with no money
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.720]   or if you're a rich, rich man
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:03.720]   but you have committed
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.720]   great sin,
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.720]   all of His mercies,
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:08.720]   all of His grace
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.720]   is consistent.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.720]   So that's what I'm saying
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.720]   is that this is the glorious
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.720]   attribute of God
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.720]   that maybe we don't think about
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.720]   quite often,
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.720]   but He is just not
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.720]   in an individual
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.720]   who judges us
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.720]   just by our face
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.720]   and appearance,
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.720]   but He sees all
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.720]   in His righteousness,
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.720]   and from that foundation
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.720]   He gives mercy,
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.720]   and so that moves us
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.720]   to our application
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.720]   where we know that our command
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.720]   is to be like God.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.720]   Point number three,
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.720]   your judgment,
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.720]   the way that you view people
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.720]   must then be in keeping
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.720]   with God's law.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.720]   Your judgment
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.720]   must be in keeping
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.720]   with God's law.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.720]   Take a moment with me
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.720]   to look at James 2:8-11,
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.720]   and notice how it says,
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.720]   "However, you are fulfilling
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.720]   "the royal law
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.720]   "according to Scripture.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.720]   "You shall love your neighbor
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.720]   "as yourself."
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.720]   Then you're doing well,
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.720]   but if you show partiality,
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.720]   you are committing sin
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.720]   and are convicted
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.720]   by the law
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.720]   as a transgressor,
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.720]   and I just summarized that
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.720]   in my first point, point A
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.720]   of our third point here,
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.720]   that basically when we practice
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.720]   any kind of favoritism,
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.720]   we're transgressing God's law.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.720]   The law of God
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:28.720]   reveals His character
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:29.720]   and how He operates
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.720]   in the universe,
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.720]   and He says,
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.720]   "You're going against that."
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.720]   Verse 10,
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.720]   "For whoever keeps the whole law
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.720]   "and yet stumbles in one point,
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.720]   "he has become guilty of all.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.720]   "For he who has said,
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.720]   "'Do not commit adultery,'
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.720]   "also said, 'Do not commit murder.'
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.720]   "But if you do not commit adultery,
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:46.720]   "but commit murder,
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:47.720]   "you have become
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.720]   "a transgressor of the law."
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.720]   So the point is very clear,
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.720]   and it's a point that we've read
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:53.720]   in the book of Galatians
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:54.720]   as we've been doing Bible study
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.720]   in the midweek,
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.720]   that when you transgress God's law,
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.720]   you've become a transgressor.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.720]   It just highlights the idea
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:05.720]   that we in our culture
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:06.720]   and in our heart,
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.720]   we minimize our sin,
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:10.720]   that we are sometimes
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:14.720]   respective people.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:15.720]   And in order to highlight this,
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.720]   I just want us to imagine, okay?
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.720]   Again, I don't want you guys
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:20.720]   to overdo it,
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.720]   that if you are nice
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.720]   to anyone in particular,
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.720]   that I'm sitting here judging you,
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.720]   especially you guys,
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.720]   if you treat somebody
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.720]   with some kind of chivalrous
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.720]   and gentleman nature,
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.720]   I'm sitting here like,
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:34.720]   "Ooh, you like her."
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.720]   That's not what I'm thinking, okay?
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:38.720]   But I want us to just imagine
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.720]   this point that this particular sin
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.720]   we don't think about a lot,
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.720]   but God sees it as evil.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:46.720]   So imagine with me that scenario
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:47.720]   we saw earlier
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.720]   of somebody coming in
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.720]   who's like a major celebrity.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.720]   I apologize for using this example,
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:53.720]   but the person I thought about first
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.720]   was Taylor Swift
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.720]   because she is like
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.720]   A-list of A-list people now, right?
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.720]   And what was funny was
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.720]   I just automatically assumed
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.720]   that her fan base
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.720]   was like 13-year-old girls.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.720]   But then I was wrong.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.720]   There are older men,
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:09.720]   there are older ladies.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:10.720]   Sometimes when I see photos
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:11.720]   of concerts,
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.720]   I see like 50-year-old women
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.720]   and like just older people
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.720]   loving and eating up her songs.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.720]   Cool?
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:19.720]   She's loved,
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:20.720]   like just beloved
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.720]   by a lot of people, okay?
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.720]   So I want you to imagine
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.720]   lo and behold,
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.720]   she catches wind
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.720]   that Berean Community Church
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.720]   is having a special event
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.720]   and she shows up.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.720]   How would you respond?
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.720]   Like just prepare yourself
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.720]   to meet a celebrity here one day.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.720]   How would you respond, right?
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.720]   Initially, you'd be like,
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.720]   "Oh my gosh!
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   "Do you know who's here?"
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.720]   And you'd probably tell your friend
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:42.720]   and you'd do the
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.720]   look, look, look, you know?
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.720]   And then you would tell your friend,
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.720]   "Don't embarrass me, okay?"
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.720]   Like don't go all crazy now,
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:49.720]   but then you're getting all crazy.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:51.720]   Maybe you go up and you say,
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.720]   "Hi, I'm so-and-so.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.720]   "I'm Mark.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.720]   "I'm so glad you're here."
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.720]   Okay, you're just being very welcoming,
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:58.720]   but then you go above and beyond.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.720]   You're like, "Come on in."
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.720]   And then you're like,
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.720]   "We have a cafe."
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.720]   So you take her to the cafe
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.720]   and then you buy her, you know,
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.720]   a discounted cup of coffee
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.720]   and you're like,
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.720]   "Look, I'm serving you," you know?
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.720]   And then okay,
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:12.720]   you're like treating her really well,
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.720]   but then you come to the door
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.720]   and then the welcome team people
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:17.720]   are like, "Sorry, no coffee,"
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   but they're like,
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:19.720]   "But she's Taylor," right?
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.720]   And you're like,
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.720]   "You can bring it in."
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.720]   Did you sin?
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.720]   Now let's say this analogy continues on
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.720]   and you're just coming over here
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.720]   and I love the fact that actually
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.720]   when I look out,
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.720]   the people who are sitting up in the front
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.720]   sometimes are like our college students,
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.720]   a lot of young people, et cetera,
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.720]   and Chase is right here,
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.720]   but then he's always in the front,
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.720]   but imagine if I come over,
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.720]   I'm like, "Chase, get lost," right?
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:42.720]   "Get out."
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.720]   Like Taylor needs to sit up here in the front.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.720]   There's no room, okay?
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.720]   Did I sin?
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.720]   Did I?
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.720]   Now the thing about it is
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.720]   I think we would all be like,
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.720]   "I get it.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.720]   "It's Taylor Swift," right?
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.720]   And for the guys,
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.720]   I realize obviously
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.720]   if you're not a fan of Taylor Swift,
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.720]   but for me, I'm a huge basketball fan,
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.720]   so if Michael Jordan came,
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.720]   you'd bet I'd buy him coffee, you know?
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.720]   I'd have him like,
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.720]   "Sign my shirt," you know?
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.720]   I mean, that's what I would probably do, right?
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.720]   And then we would all understand that and laugh
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.720]   because that's just what we do.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.720]   And then God says,
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:22.720]   "That's contrary to my law."
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.720]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.720]   To all of us, all of that would be acceptable
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.720]   because it's Michael Jordan,
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.720]   because it's Taylor Swift.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:33.720]   And God says, "That's contrary to my law,"
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.720]   and you don't fully understand
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.720]   that goes against my royal law.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.720]   And I am the one who told you not to murder
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.720]   or to commit adultery,
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:42.720]   and yet here you are
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.720]   being a respecter of persons,
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.720]   and I told you, "No, I don't operate like that."
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:48.720]   But as a second part,
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.720]   not only is it against my law,
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:54.720]   He says, "That's against my mercy."
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.720]   That's not how I show favor.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.720]   Every single person who walks into this room
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.720]   is going to come into this room by mercy, amen?
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.720]   And it doesn't matter if they're Michael Jordan.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.720]   They'll walk in here,
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.720]   not because they're Michael Jordan.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.720]   They will not take a seat of honor
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.720]   because they're Michael Jordan,
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:13.720]   but because of mercy.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.720]   And God says, "When you do that,
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:19.720]   "you mess up my picture of the gospel."
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:20.720]   And in that sense, I'm like,
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:24.720]   "Oh my gosh, God, I'm sorry."
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:25.720]   You're right.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:28.720]   And as much as I think I'm not going to do that,
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.720]   if I saw Michael Jordan,
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:34.720]   I would probably act a little silly.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:36.720]   Yes?
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.720]   But that is not the way God works,
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:40.720]   and what's more,
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.720]   He might look at us,
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:42.720]   you know, in this passage,
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.720]   He says, "Wait a minute.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:45.720]   "Aren't these people that you're honoring
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.720]   "the people who oppress you,
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.720]   "who blaspheme God?"
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:51.720]   So God is going to look at us and say,
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:54.720]   "How can you be so impressed?
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.720]   "You think it's such a minor sin
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.720]   "to be impressed by money?
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.720]   "You think it's a minor sin
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.720]   "to be just impressed by this celebrity status?
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.720]   "But how can you be so impressed
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:07.720]   "with this pagan who just happens to dunk a ball,
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.720]   "who can jump a little higher than you?"
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:10.720]   It's like to me, to God,
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.720]   it would be like little grains of sand,
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:13.720]   but one grain of sand
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.720]   is just a little taller than the other.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:18.720]   You honor stuff that I would judge.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:19.720]   You know, just recently,
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:20.720]   it kind of wrecked my world
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.720]   about basketball and stuff like that.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.720]   I read that the entourage
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.720]   that walks around with Michael Jordan
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.720]   calls him Yahweh.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:34.720]   Yeah, I went, "What?"
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:38.720]   My favorite player is going to get judged by God.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.720]   Why do I honor him?
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.720]   Now, if you're major sports fans
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:46.720]   or fans of musicians,
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:47.720]   I'm not dogging on you.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:51.720]   You could have a favorite something or other,
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:52.720]   but it's an appropriate question to ask.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.720]   What are you so impressed by,
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.720]   and what does that tell us?
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.720]   What are you giving honor and respect to?
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.720]   Are we giving our honor and respect to pagans
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.720]   because they can sing well?
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.720]   We dare not then allow that worldly fleshliness
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.720]   to come into our church
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.720]   that we would be respecters of men.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:12.720]   Amen?
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.720]   That's the application.
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:17.720]   And so God says it's so different in his world.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:21.720]   1 Corinthians 1, verse 27.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.720]   1 Corinthians 1, verse 27.
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.720]   "But God has chosen the foolish things of the world
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.720]   "to shame the wise,
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.720]   "and God has chosen the weak things of the world
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.720]   "to shame the things which are strong.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.720]   "And the base things of the world
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:37.720]   "and the despised God has chosen.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.720]   "The things that are not,
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.720]   "so that he may nullify the things that are,
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:45.720]   "so that no man may boast before God."
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.720]   So in one section, we know,
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:50.720]   because God is impartial and glorious,
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:51.720]   then amen.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.720]   I will not glorify and pride myself in the flesh
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:57.720]   even if that individual
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:59.720]   brings me some kind of pleasure
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.720]   about how good they are.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.720]   But on the flip side, he says,
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:04.720]   obviously we're not gonna condemn any individual
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:07.720]   because God says if you mock a poor person,
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.720]   God has honored that person,
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.720]   favored that person,
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.720]   graced that person.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:15.720]   How dare you dishonor somebody that God has graced?
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.720]   Amen?
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.720]   And in that way, our God is glorious.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.720]   In that way, our God is merciful.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:24.720]   It's so amazing.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.720]   There's another passage I want you guys
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:27.720]   to turn your Bible over to.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.720]   It's Exodus chapter 23, verses one through nine.
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.720]   Exodus chapter 23, verses one through nine.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:39.720]   It says, "You shall not bear a false report.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.720]   "Do not join your hand with a wicked man
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:43.720]   "to be a malicious witness.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.720]   "You shall not follow the masses in doing evil,
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:48.720]   "nor shall you testify in a dispute
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.720]   "so as to turn aside after a multitude
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.720]   "in order to pervert justice.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:56.720]   "Nor shall you be partial to a poor man in his dispute."
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:58.720]   I feel like, just to comment,
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:01.720]   that in our generation, there is temptation to do so.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:05.720]   Because we live in a instantaneous media generation
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:06.720]   where news flies fast,
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.720]   we get the first glimpse of news,
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.720]   and we can join in a false accusation.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.720]   We can have group thinking.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.720]   We can have bias, and we can condemn people.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.720]   Be very cautious, amen?
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:22.720]   God does not want that kind of judging us.
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.720]   He does not want us to have partiality.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:28.720]   Verse four, "If you meet your enemy's ox
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.720]   "or his donkey wandering away,
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.720]   "you shall surely return it to him."
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:34.720]   I thought that was so funny,
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:38.720]   that God cares enough to imagine a scenario
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:41.720]   where you see a donkey in trouble.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.720]   But take a look at this, verse five.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:46.720]   "If you see the donkey of the one who hates you
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.720]   "lying helpless under its load,
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.720]   "you shall refrain from leaving it to him.
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.720]   "You shall surely release it to him."
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.720]   So there he's saying, even in a situation
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.720]   where you know this donkey belongs to a guy
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.720]   who hates your guts,
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.720]   you're not allowed to just be like,
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.720]   "Ha ha, sucka," and leave.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.720]   But you're supposed to help.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.720]   Verse six, "So then you shall not pervert the justice
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.720]   "due to your needy brother and his dispute.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.720]   "Keep far from a false charge
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.720]   "and do not kill the innocent or the righteous,
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.720]   "for I will not quit the guilty.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.720]   "You shall not take a bribe or a bribe blind,
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.720]   "for a bribe blinds a clear-sighted
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:23.720]   "and subverts the cause of the just.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.720]   "You shall not oppress a stranger
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.720]   "since you yourselves know the feelings of a stranger,
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.720]   "for you also were strangers in the land of Egypt."
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:39.720]   So that point, again, being so impartial
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.720]   that you're treating every individual
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.720]   with the kind of humility, yes?
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.720]   With the kind of fairness of Christ.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.720]   And what we're shooting at is, remember,
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.720]   the whole thing was our religion should be pure.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.720]   Another way to say it is, let also our love be pure.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.720]   One of the ways that Christ was very offended
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.720]   is Christ would regularly say, "You know the law.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.720]   "You know you're supposed to love your neighbor."
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.720]   And what was the petty response of the people?
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.720]   "Well, who's my neighbor, though?"
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.720]   Right, like that was the response.
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.720]   And God says, "No, I want your love to be pure.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.720]   "I know you're a people of sight, but walk by faith."
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.720]   And therefore, another way to say this is point number four,
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.720]   that you must speak and act as those
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.720]   who are judged by the law of liberty.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.720]   In the charge for you to not show favoritism,
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.720]   another way to say this is,
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.720]   "I want you to speak and act as those
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.720]   "who are judged by the law of liberty."
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.720]   You know, the reason why I came to this passage
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.720]   is because so much of our weekday Bible study
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.720]   was pointing to this, pointing to this,
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.720]   saying, "You are free.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.720]   "You're free in Christ."
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.720]   And what's more, the passage literally tells us
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.720]   that you're going to be assessed, evaluated,
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.720]   and Christ is going to come to a point
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.720]   where that reckoning and rewarding is gonna happen,
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.720]   but he's going to use the standard of your liberty,
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.720]   which is strange to think about, right?
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.720]   Now, another way I want you to have you think about this
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.720]   is in Galatians chapter five, verse 13, it says,
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.720]   "For you are called to freedom, brothers.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.720]   "Only do not use your freedom
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.720]   "as an opportunity for the flesh,
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.720]   "but through love, serve one another."
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.720]   Through love, serve one another.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.720]   I made point of this on Wednesday,
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.720]   but I want to reiterate to you.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.720]   In God's eyes, you are so blessed.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.720]   You're free.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.720]   You have the spiritual blessings of Christ
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:43.720]   to say that you're free from the curse of the law,
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:46.720]   to say that you have the love of Christ.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.720]   You're so thoroughly blessed,
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:52.720]   and so how will God assess you?
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.720]   What have you done with all this blessing?
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.720]   Have you been complaining like the world?
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.720]   "We don't have enough, and we need more power,
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.720]   "and we need more money."
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720]   Have you been grumbling?
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.720]   "It's not fair."
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:09.720]   Have you been talking like the world,
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   where you just are ambitious to be higher,
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.720]   greater, faster, more skilled, more honored?
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:20.720]   You're free from all of that.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.720]   God sees you,
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.720]   and you should see yourself as free.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.720]   Amen?
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.720]   Another way to think about this is,
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.720]   you know who you're not going to be judged by?
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.720]   Even though we're very afraid,
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.720]   every single one of us, because we're human,
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:40.720]   we have the fear of man.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.720]   God says you're free from the judgment of man.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.720]   God says you're free from the threats of man.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.720]   You're free from the false promises of man,
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.720]   and you're free from the examination
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.720]   and the kind of cruel judgment of this world,
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.720]   the world that will constantly make you feel like less.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.720]   "You don't have enough. You don't have this."
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.720]   And it's constantly producing in us the false expectation
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.720]   that we need to live up to its standards,
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.720]   or else we're going to incur its judgment and its curses.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.720]   "Oh, no. If I don't go to this prestigious school,
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.720]   oh, no, if I'm not a part of this group,
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.720]   what's going to happen to me?"
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.720]   Brothers and sisters, we're free.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.720]   Amen?
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.720]   We're free.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.720]   Speak and live like those who have liberty.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.720]   God sees you as ones who have been so blessed by Christ,
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.720]   it turns everything upside down.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:44.720]   Yes, the world sees the poor man as the one who has no power,
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.720]   but what does the Scripture say?
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.720]   By way of conclusions, James 1:9-11.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.720]   James 1:9-11, this is what the Scripture says.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.720]   "But the brother of the humble circumstances
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.720]   is to glory in his high position,
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.720]   and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation,
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:06.720]   because like flowering grass, he will pass away.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.720]   For the sun rises with a scorching wind,
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:13.720]   and it withers the grass, and its flower falls off,
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.720]   and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.720]   So, too, the rich man, in the midst of his pursuits,
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.720]   will fade away."
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.720]   I want to conclude by saying this.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.720]   I know that the majority of us,
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.720]   I mean, we're not going to be so silly like the world
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.720]   and be like, "Oh my gosh, Michael Jordan, you're my idol."
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.720]   Right?
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.720]   "I wanted to be just like Mike," you know,
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.720]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.720]   And we're going to impress him by how much of a fan I am,
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:44.720]   which, you know, with my youth, that's what I would have done.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.720]   But there is this question.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   Do we still buy into that system?
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.720]   And I would say, I don't know.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.720]   I mean, I don't think so.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.720]   I don't want--now that I'm, you know, older,
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.720]   I've lived my life as a Christian for 42 years--
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.720]   how old am I, 41 years?
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.720]   Now I'm 41 years, and I've lived my life as a Christian
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.720]   for the last half of it, right, 20-some years.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.720]   I know better than to want to be like Mike.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:11.720]   Right?
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:15.720]   So in that way, I've been fighting the stain of the world.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.720]   No, I don't want to be the tallest, best basketball player,
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.720]   the most richest person in the church.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:21.720]   I don't want any of that.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:24.720]   But then, as I was praying over this, I asked,
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.720]   "Is there any of it within my heart, Lord?"
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.720]   And then I thought about my kids.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.720]   I want them to ball it up so hard, they just break ankles.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.720]   I want them to be taller, so I'm like, "Eat more, eat more."
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.720]   You know what I mean?
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.720]   I want them to be well-educated,
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:43.720]   so I'm thinking and researching the best way to educate them.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:47.720]   And I realize the system of the world is so subtle.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.720]   It's all around, right?
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.720]   I want it for my kids.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:57.720]   And then I know in my heart whatever my kid experiences, I experience.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:58.720]   Right?
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:01.720]   My pride now comes from their pride.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:07.720]   Let it be that I am not impressed with wealth, height, or skill,
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:12.720]   but the man who loves Christ, the man who has faith.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:13.720]   This to us is glorious.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.720]   Amen?
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:20.720]   Let's pray.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.720]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:30.720]   God, from your vantage point, it must be so obnoxious and silly
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:35.720]   for people who are in a humble posture,
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.720]   a situation of desperate need for you,
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:43.720]   and then constantly they're playing this game of wanting to be more and better.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:48.720]   But God, thank you, Lord, that in your mercy you have given us a solution.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.720]   You could have just crushed us, but thank you for Christ,
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:56.720]   that you teach us a better way, a way of humility,
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:00.720]   a way of perfect contentment in our Lord Jesus.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:03.720]   I ask, God, that in that way we would learn what it means
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.720]   to be unstained by this world.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:06.720]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.720]   Amen.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:26.720]   Let us stand together for the closing praise.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:39.720]   The love of God is greater far than tongue or pen can ever tell.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:52.720]   It goes beyond the highest star and reaches to the lowest hell.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:59.720]   The guilty pair bow down with care.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:06.720]   God gave his Son to win.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:26.720]   His erring child he reconciled and parted from his sin.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:42.720]   When years of time shall pass away and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall,
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:55.720]   when men who year refuse to pray on rocks and hills and mountains call,
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:08.720]   God's love so sure shall still endure all measureless and strong,
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:20.720]   redeeming grace to Adam's race, the saints' and angels' song.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:34.720]   Oh, love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:57.720]   It shall forevermore endure the saints' and angels' song.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:21.720]   Oh, love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:50.720]   Oh, love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:12:03.720]   Oh, love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:14.720]   It shall forevermore endure the saints' and angels'.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:29.720]   Oh, love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:42.720]   It shall forevermore endure the saints' and angels' song.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:59.720]   It shall forevermore endure the saints' and angels' song.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.720]   Amen. Let's pray together.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:06.720]   Father God, as we sing that song, we just want to thank you.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:13.720]   God, that your love is perfect and pure, and God is not tainted by any selfishness.
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:18.720]   As you are the sustainer and giver of all life, you needed nothing from us,
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:23.720]   and therefore you lavishly gave to us your grace and your mercy.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.720]   Father God, what can we give to you in return?
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.720]   Lord, we just thank you.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.720]   And I pray, Lord, that you would guide us and lead us,
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.720]   so then our eyes and our judgment would be righteous like yours.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:39.720]   But also, Lord, that our hearts would then freely love,
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:42.720]   that without trying to play any games with people,
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.720]   trying to barter, trying to climb, trying to compete,
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.720]   but help us, Father God, to love as you do.
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:51.720]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:56.720]   God sent his Son.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:01.720]   They called him Jesus.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:10.720]   He came to love, heal and forgive.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:20.720]   He lived and died to buy my pardon.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:29.720]   An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lived.
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:38.720]   Because He lived, I can face tomorrow.
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:48.720]   Because He lived, all fear is gone.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:57.720]   Because I know He holds the future.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:07.720]   And life is worth the living just because He lived.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:32.720]   [music]
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:41.720]   My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:50.720]   I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:59.720]   On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:04.720]   All other ground is sinking sand.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:22.720]   [music]
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:31.720]   When darkness veils His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:39.720]   In every high and stormy gale, my anger holds within.
