[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   >> All right, good morning.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Let me get to a few announcements again.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Starting from today, we have a college study hall,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   so that's the end of the quarter.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And so starting from tonight at 6 o'clock to 2 a.m.,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   today, Monday, and Tuesday.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   So if you have snacks or anything that you want to bring
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   to encourage them, just drop it off at the cafe area.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Living Well Pregnancy Center.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   The bottles, if you took the bottles,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   and they said that they need that turned back in by next Sunday.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   So the station where you can drop that off is on --
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   when you go outside, there's going to be a table out there,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   so please visit that and drop it off there.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Christmas service is coming up in two Sundays.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   And obviously, as you're coming in,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   you probably received one of these cards.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And again, if you need more of it just to invite people
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   or use it as an opportunity to share the gospel,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   please take some more.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   We'll have plenty.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And then on that Sunday, our outreach team is going to be having
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   an outreach team table stationed outside.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   So if you have friends that are coming who want to ask more questions
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   or they have materials that they can give,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   they can take home with them, so please visit that table outside.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Again, that's going to be there on that Sunday.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   New Year's Eve service.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   On Tuesday, on December 31st at 11 p.m.,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   we have our New Year's Eve service,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   and we have this every year to welcome the new year as an act of giving
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   our firstfruits to the Lord as we welcome the new year.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   So we encourage you to come out today.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   It starts at 11 p.m.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   It should be done around 12, 15.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   And there is a ping-pong tournament along with that during the day
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   if you are willing to participate in that.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And that happens earlier part of the day around 5 o'clock.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   BBA, WBBA sign-up.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   If you are applying to play basketball,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   they said that this week is the last week that you can sign up,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   so please sign up for that.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And you do need to be a member to participate in this fellowship,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   so please sign up for that.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   The sign-up, again, this week is the last week.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   The table is outside, so please sign up for that.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Lastly, Winter Bible Study.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   That's starting on February 5th.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   The subject is going to be hermeneutics.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Obviously, this Sunday is our last Sunday for this session of Bible study,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   and the next session is going to start on February 5th.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Pastor Mark is going to go through hermeneutics.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Basically, hermeneutics is how to study the Bible.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I know we have a class that we've been offering for people to kind of jump in
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   and learn how to do inductive Bible study.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   But this is going to be much more extensive.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   It's going to be going through how to study through the narratives,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   how to study through the poetry,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   how to study through the epistles and various things.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And so Pastor Mark is going to go through specific passages for us
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   and how to do that study, how to interpret, how to apply, that type of stuff.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   And so that's starting on February 5th.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   So please sign up.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   There's going to be opportunity to sign up through Wednesday
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   or Weekday Bible Study or on the website, I think through the QR code.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   So we ask that you do that as soon as possible
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   so that we can prepare the small groups and home groups
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   before we get started in February.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   I think that's it for my announcements.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Let me pray for us and then give you an opportunity to give online
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   or a physical offering as you're exiting.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Okay, let's pray.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   We pray, Father, that all the distractions
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   and the things that so easily entangles us,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   help us, Lord God, to be freed from that
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   and to fix our eyes completely upon Christ.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Lord, we desire to meet you.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   We desire to worship you.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   We desire, Father God, to see a greater glimpse of who you are each Sunday.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Guide us and lead us and deliver us, Lord God,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   that we may be worshipers in spirit and in truth.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   I pray that this giving that we give
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   and help it, Lord God, to be used for the sake of your righteousness
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and for your gospel.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   There's more than enough men who are willing to pay and to abuse them,
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   to gratify their perverted sexual desires.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   I've only highlighted some of the things that I've seen.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   Some of you have experienced horrendous things.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   Maybe even now.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   We are in a desperate situation.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   Whether they're living in a mansion or whether they're homeless,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   the spiritual state in the eyes of God is no different.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   And that's why he says, "To beseech the Lord of the harvest."
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   Until the Lord opens our eyes to see.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   He saw us, and instead of being disgusted,
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   He came, drew near to us.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   And that while we were yet sinners, while we were blaspheming,
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   while we should have been disgusting to a holy, holy, holy God,
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   He had compassion on us.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   Because we were sheep without shepherds, lost and harassed.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   And He told His disciples, "Harvest is plentiful, workers are few."
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   "Beseech the Lord of the harvest. Beg the Lord of the harvest."
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   They don't know how to pray. They don't know how to come to God.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   That's why He called us.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   So that we would be a light in this dark world.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   Sometimes when a church has been around for a long time,
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   we forget why we planted the church.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   We didn't plant the church so that you could have a nice, safe place
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   to gather together on Sunday.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   The church is not planted so that our kids are protected from this evil world.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   That's not the reason.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   It's so that we can be a light.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   We can take the gospel to the remotest parts.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   And a church, a brand new church plant, is very aware of that.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   And they're actively engaged, but for whatever the reason,
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   any church that's been around for 5, 6, 7, 8 years,
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   they forget about the harvest.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   And then it becomes about us.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   "Harvest is plentiful, workers are few."
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   "Beg the Lord of the harvest."
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   "Ask the Lord to open your eyes to see the suffering around us."
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   Some people are doing a good job faking it.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   They're pretending.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   They're pretending because they don't want you to see.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   But if you spend enough time with anybody, a billionaire, a homeless person,
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   the brokenness is the same.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   Because they have been separated from the shepherd of life.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   That's why you and I have been called to be a light in this dark world.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   I want to end my sermon.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   I want to play you this song from Keith Green
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   because it was rebuking and challenging to me many years.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   And some of you guys would know who Keith Green is.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   No nonsense, right?
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   So I want you to listen to this song.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   The praise team is going to lead us in our closing song.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   Do you see, do you see all the people sinking down?
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   Don't you care, don't you care?
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   Are you going to let them drown?
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   How can you be so numb not to care if they come?
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   You close your eyes and pretend the job's done.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   Bless me, Lord, bless me, Lord.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   You know it's all I ever hear.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   No one aches, no one hurts, no one even sheds one tear.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   But he cries, he weeps, he bleeds, and he cares for your needs.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   And you just lay back and keep soaking it in.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   Oh, can't you see it's such a sin?
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   He brings people to your door, and you turn them away
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   as you smile and say, God bless me.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   Be at peace, and all heaven just weeps.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   Because Jesus came to your door.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   You've left him out on the streets.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   Open up, open up, and give yourself away.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   You see the need, you hear the cries, so how can you delay?
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   God's calling, and you're the one.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   But like John, you run.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   He's told you to speak, but you keep holding it in.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   Holding it in.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   Oh, can't you see it's such a sin?
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   The world is sleeping in the dark
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   that the church just can't fight 'cause it's asleep in the light.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   How can you be so dead when you've been so well fed?
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   Jesus rose from the grave, and you, you can't even get out of bed.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   Oh, Jesus rose from the dead.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   Come on, get out of your bed.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   How can you be so dumb not to care if they come?
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   You close your eyes and pretend the job's done.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   You close your eyes and pretend the job's done.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   Don't close your eyes.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   Don't pretend the job's done.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   Come away, come away, come away with me, my love.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   Come away from this mess.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   Come away with me, my love.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   Church family, let's all stand together.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   I'm going to let that settle because that's one of those songs.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   But as we sing this last song, I would hope that we would understand the call for us,
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   but just the contrast between what we have in this song and the big hope that we know Christ,
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   that we have just that great appreciation for what he's done for us.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   [Music]
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   How great the chasm that lay between us.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:26.000]   How high the mountain I could not climb.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   In desperation, I turned to heaven and spoke your name in tune.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   And through the darkness, your loving kindness tore through the shadows of my spine.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000]   The work is finished.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   The end is written.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   Oh, come and guide me, oh, God of mercy.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   Oh, how I could ever feel such boundless grace.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   Oh, God of angels, I stand down from the grave to wear my soul and wear my shoes.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   The cross has spoken.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   I am forgiven.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   The King of kings was risen.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   Oh, Savior, I'm yours forever.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   Hallelujah.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   It's the one who set me free.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   Hallelujah.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   God's love is real for me.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   You have broken every chain.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   In salvation lay your name.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   In kingdom come that sealed the promise.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   Your buried body began to breathe.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   Out of the silence, a roaring loudness.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   And the grave has no grave but my name.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   In kingdom come that sealed the promise.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   Your buried body began to breathe.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   Out of the silence, a roaring loudness.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   And the grave has no grave but my name.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   Hallelujah.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   It's the one who set me free.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   Hallelujah.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000]   God's love is real for me.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   You have broken every chain.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   In salvation lay your name.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   It's the one who set me free.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   Hallelujah.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   God's love is real for me.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   You have broken every chain.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   In salvation lay your name.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   Let's pray.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000]   eternal love of God the Father,
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   rest, restore, encourage, rebuke, and build
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   the church, Lord God, that we may live
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   worthy of the gospel that you've given us.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   Open our eyes, Lord God, to see
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   the desperate situation, Lord,
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   that our families, friends, co-workers,
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   our neighbors are in.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000]   That we may on their behalf
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   be intercessors, to beseech, to beg,
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   to plead on their behalf, Lord God,
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   that their eyes may be opened too.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   That we would have the courage to open
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   our mouth, Lord God, to go where you go,
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   to say what you say, and to do what you do.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   Help us, Lord God, to deny ourselves,
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   to pick up our cross daily,
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   and follow your calling to the harvest.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   May the aroma of Christ go wherever
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000]   you send your church this week.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
