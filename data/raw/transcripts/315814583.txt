[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   I hope you guys had a good discussion. I had some questions that came in. Most of these
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.840]   things are probably going to be addressed just from the regular going over this section.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:26.160]   I think I missed two. We had praise and prayer before we left and then I was gone for a week.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.520]   Usually it takes me about one or two sessions to jump back in. I forgot what time we were
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:37.840]   supposed to start. Is this the right time? Am I too early? This is good? Okay. I got
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.800]   to mark that. All right. Okay. So we're looking at verse 13 to 20. So let me pray first and
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:54.840]   we'll jump right in. Heavenly Father, we ask Lord God that you would bless this time. Help
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.160]   us to deepen our understanding of Christ and what he has done, who he is, would cause us
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.420]   Lord God to deepen our appreciation of what it is that we have and that we would live
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.320]   our lives according to the knowledge that we gain. We pray Father that you would bless
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.280]   this time, bless the fellowship that we have, the conversations, the discussions, may it
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.600]   all lead to sanctification of your church. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. All right. To
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.480]   begin, just to kind of again, like each session we want to just give you just some hints or
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.760]   some guide as to how to study the text. There was some confusion and I'm sure it's hopefully
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.240]   it's cleared up by now. When I asked you guys to take some time to ask the questions, asking
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.360]   a question was not your homework. Asking the question is to get you to study it. Okay.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.840]   Hopefully that was clear by now. The reason why I didn't want to give you the question
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.260]   is because part of the study is for you to ask the question. Right? So that you can dig
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.960]   and say, "Oh, what's going on here?" So that would lead to you digging and looking for
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.840]   observations. Instead of me saying, "Hey, answer these questions," then you just answer
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.720]   it and then finish your thing. So hopefully that's clear by now. So the homework for the
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.360]   week is actually for you to take those questions that you may have discussed in your group
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.280]   and do your best to answer it and then come. So if you haven't been doing that, hopefully
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.120]   that'll clear things up. Okay. And then each session, we're not just going to give you
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.920]   some guidelines as to what to look for. And then hopefully that'll help you in doing future
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.200]   Bible studies. So the goal of this Bible study is not simply to know the book of Colossians
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.600]   for me to study and then say, "Hey, here's what this passage means." The real goal for
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.520]   this is for you to be able to go to your home and take the same principles and study 1 Thessalonians
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.120]   on your own. Do quiet time in this manner. So you don't just skim through the book and
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.960]   then say, "Oh, I understand it." Okay. So a couple of things in your handouts, right?
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.000]   It begins with, I asked three things or three things to look for. One is where are the paragraph
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.320]   breaks in this session, in this text, verse 13 to 17 or 20. Within the paragraph breaks,
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.280]   what are the specific thoughts or teachings within each division? Meaning once you get
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.520]   the bigger picture in the 20 verses, go in deeply and don't end with just a division
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.240]   of these groups. But within that, what are the thoughts? What are the arguments that
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.880]   are being made? And one of the things that will help you to do that is asking what are
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.680]   the key words? I saw Pastor Mark's teaching and he kind of covered a little bit about
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.320]   this last time. But again, we want to help you to do that. So we're going to jump right
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.800]   in and we're going to look at the fourfold division, okay? At least that I found, okay?
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.860]   I broke up. If you look at the second sheet, basically what I did was I copied the verses
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.280]   on the sheet and I broke it down for you in thoughts, okay? Remember I told you that this
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.640]   is what I do whenever I do quiet time or when I'm preparing for a sermon and I want to see
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.320]   the thought flow of the author, I break it down into thoughts, right? So this is Jesus
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.240]   Christ. He died for us. He came back from the dead. And so breaking it down like that
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.760]   helps me to see the thought flow of the author. And so I did that for you here, right? So
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.600]   whenever there's a comma or and or therefore, I put it in a separate line just so that you
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.160]   can see the different thought flow. So, and I also gave you this because I want you to
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.600]   take your notes on this, right? You're going to be taking some notes on this and this is
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.960]   just a general outline. So I gave you some space for that. But I also want you, as I'm
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.200]   going through the text and I want you to highlight where the insights are coming from. So the
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.560]   most of the things that I'm going to be saying are things because we sat, I sat there and
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.160]   and just combed through the text. It's not because of some Greek exegesis. It's not because
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.600]   I saw this in a commentary or it's not because of seminary education. Anybody who picks up
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.760]   the Bible and starts to ask questions and take time to dig, you should be able to come
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.840]   up with these same insights. So I'm going to show you, okay, these are some of the things
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.560]   that I've observed and hopefully if you've done your study and and taken plenty of time
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.960]   to comb through the text, you'll probably see like, oh, I saw the same thing, right?
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.200]   Again majority of these things that I'm going to be saying is not coming from any commentary.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.680]   It's just from observation coming from here. Okay. Some of the questions that you ask,
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.320]   obviously, it'll be helpful to know this information before. All right. If you look at verse 13
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.400]   to 20, okay, and I'm not going to do this, ask you to do this now, but there are clear
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.800]   breaks. If I was to give a sermon on these verses, it'd be probably a four-part sermon
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.400]   because there's clearly four separate thoughts that are tied together, but then it's given
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:03.800]   in four-paragraph form. So the first paragraph is found in verse 13 and 14. So that's the
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:16.600]   first paragraph and that basically is, okay, I'm going to write it here, "who Jesus is
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:26.200]   to us." Again, I'm just using my words, okay, that's what I observed. Second thought flow
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   I see in verse 15 to 17. Number two, "who Jesus is in light of creation." Okay. Oh,
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:07:04.200]   did it move? All right. The third one is verse 18 along. Getting uglier and uglier as I go.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:27.440]   Anyway, you know what I mean. Okay. "Who Jesus is in light of creation." Okay. You can't
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:46.320]   read it? Oh, sorry. Light of the church. And then the fourth paragraph, "who Jesus is in
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:55.720]   light of the Father." So if I was to give, if I was preaching through the book of Colossians,
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:01.680]   that would kind of be the breakdown of the thought flow, right? It's Christology broken
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:08.160]   up into four parts. Who Jesus is in relation to us, what did he do for us? Who Jesus is
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.560]   in relation to creation, right? He's the creator, he's the sustainer, all things are created
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.720]   by him and for him. Who is Jesus in relation to the church? And then who is Jesus in relation
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.040]   to the Father? All of it Christology, but in four separate parts. Okay. Again, the reason
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.360]   why we do that is because you understand the thought flow of the author. It'll help you
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.680]   to understand the details a little bit better because you'll see where the thought flow
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:44.040]   fits. Okay. So that's the broad outline. So, and I gave on this sheet, you know, four and
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.440]   then each one has the separate title so you don't have to write it down. So if you want
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.760]   to take notes, you can take the notes here and make sure that you're making notes as
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:59.280]   we go here. So the first thing that we see in verse 13 and 14, so you want to take it
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.520]   section by section, right? So the first section, verse 13 and 14, who is Jesus in relation
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:11.280]   to us? And it talks about redemption. So in redemption, he mentions how he rescued us,
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.340]   transferred us, and redeemed us, right? These are all very important words that describes
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:25.640]   our salvation. So he rescued us from what? Domain of darkness. So natural question is,
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.040]   what is the domain of darkness? Who's in charge of this darkness? What created this darkness?
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.480]   These are a lot of the questions that would come up in that. So scripture clearly says
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.680]   in Luke chapter 22, 53, that the God of this age is Satan, that domain of darkness is,
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.960]   who has the power over the domain of darkness? Satan, right? So when he said that, that's
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:51.840]   found in Luke chapter 22, 53. So he rescued us from the domain of darkness. So the way
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:10:00.120]   he describes us in our salvation as we were in bondage, in slavery, by the power of Satan,
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:11.080]   whether we recognize that or not, right? He transferred us, right? He transferred us to
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:17.720]   the kingdom of his beloved son. Now this is a very important word, right? He didn't just
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:23.280]   rescue us from the domain of darkness. If your view of salvation ends with rescue from
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:29.640]   the power of sin, right? We're no longer under Satan's control. And that's where a lot of
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:35.280]   Christians end up kind of in this in-between world where we are safe from the penalty of
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.520]   our sin, but now we're waiting to get to heaven so that we can enjoy heaven for eternity.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:47.360]   The Bible describes salvation as being rescued and being transferred from domain of darkness
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:53.480]   to the kingship of Christ. And that's why in our church we read the book Lordship Salvation.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:11:00.240]   No, that's not the title of the book. Gospel according to Jesus, right? Which describes
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:09.460]   Lordship Salvation because salvation is removing us from domain of darkness and then transferring
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:15.040]   us to the kingdom. So when you say kingdom, you have a king, right? You have a king, so
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.360]   we're under his rule. Okay? So that's the second thing that is described. And then he
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.000]   said, well, how did he do that? He redeemed us, right? The idea of redemption is something
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.480]   that was worthless, thrown away, and you pay something and you redeem it back, right? And
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:37.000]   that's the idea of redemption. So he rescued us, transferred us. How did he do it? He redeemed
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.760]   us. And how did he redeem us? Redeemed us from what? For our sins, right? He didn't
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:51.040]   redeem us from poverty. He didn't redeem us from sickness or hard life or bad marriage.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:59.560]   All of these things are symptoms of sin. But it's the core issue is sin itself. So whenever
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:05.960]   you have the false gospel, the false gospel promises redemption from all these things
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:11.240]   that are hardship in life. But the Bible says the redemption happens when he delivers us
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.600]   from our sins. So when he delivers us from our sin, then people who've been delivered
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:22.680]   from sin into the kingship of Christ, then there's a reflection of that in the life of
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.280]   a believer. He becomes generous. He becomes giving. He becomes gracious. He's concerned
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.800]   about the poor. He becomes a better father, better mother, better son, better daughter.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.720]   But these are all byproducts of what happens at the core. But Jesus did not come to save
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.440]   us from poverty. Jesus did not come so that we can have an easier life. So all of these
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:49.760]   things are accurate descriptions of what happened to us. Now, how much of this did you understand
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:56.080]   when you became a Christian? Probably you understood some part of it, right? You became
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:03.200]   saved. You met Christ. So it was a supernatural encounter. Very few of us went through, you
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:09.360]   know, went through like a college of information about our faith and what happened and the
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.960]   end result of it is, oh, now I believe. Most of us went to a retreat and you heard a very
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.440]   simple presentation of the gospel that Christ loves you, died for you, he can save you from
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:23.360]   your sins. You felt the sin, convicted, and you asked for forgiveness. And all you know
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.040]   is that if you ask for forgiveness, God's going to forgive you. Now you're not going
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.760]   to be judged, you're going to be in heaven. And that's a very simple understanding of
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.840]   the gospel, but that in and of itself is enough to save you. But after you save, it's like,
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:44.520]   oh, what did that mean? Right? So even the Colossians, I don't think the Colossians when
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:50.180]   they read this, understood all of this. Like, I already know all this. Paul is revealing
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:55.840]   things about their salvation and about who Jesus is progressively. Because remember,
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.280]   all of this revelation was coming through Apostle Paul, so they didn't have this information
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:06.320]   before Paul. All they knew was they encountered Christ and they believed him. So these details
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:12.080]   are probably new to them as it is to a lot of us as we're studying. But the more we understand
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:19.600]   it, it gives light of purpose. I see a lot of Christians, like, you become a Christian
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.880]   and you're looking for purpose, or you're trying to find yourself. It's because you
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.480]   don't understand your salvation. You got stuck in between two worlds. You got saved from
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.680]   your sins, but you haven't been delivered into the kingdom. Right? You have, but you
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.640]   don't recognize it. You don't know what happened or what God is expecting. So a lot of people
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.520]   are wandering around looking for the will of God. But the will of God is for you to
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:51.840]   be under His will. Right? His will. Not, well I know God's will, but what is God's will
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.480]   for me? Does He want me to be a doctor? Does He want me to be a lawyer? Does He want me
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.880]   to do this and that? All of that has to be subjected to His kingship. Right? So if you're
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:07.380]   trying to look for His specific will for you, independent of His kingdom, you're never going
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:13.120]   to find it. Because God already revealed what His will is, to be under His will. And that's
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:19.760]   what the purpose of salvation was, is to restore a rebellious people who are refusing to submit
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:26.680]   to His kingship, to redeem them back, to transfer them from dominion of darkness into the kingdom
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:32.820]   of His Son. Right? By forgiving our sins. So that's the first part. Okay? Second part,
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:42.120]   who is Jesus in light of creation? He is the image of the invisible God. Icon. Right? Now
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:50.240]   when He says image, He's not just talking about like, take a picture. Right? You know,
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:56.720]   we take a picture, we take that picture, it's like this is the image of so-and-so. When
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.520]   He says He's the image of the invisible God, He's talking about a God that they've never
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:06.240]   personally seen. They couldn't see Him. Right? Remember the Bible says, whoever sees God,
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.640]   he will die. He can't be in the presence of this Holy God. So a God who was distant, that
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:16.200]   they heard of, right? They saw from a distance, they don't know what He looks like. Right?
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:22.480]   They only know what He's revealed. Jesus Christ actually came. So that's why when the disciples
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   asked only if you would show us the Father, right? Then we would be okay. And then Jesus
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.200]   says how long have I been with you and you still don't understand. If you've seen me,
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.400]   you have seen the Father. Right? So this is going to go back later on when it says the
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:46.160]   fullness of God dwelt in Jesus, meaning that every part of Jesus was the fullness of God.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.880]   So if you wanted to see Jesus, you don't go through Jesus to see the Father. Basically,
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:59.200]   if you've seen Jesus, you've seen the Father. Because He is the image of the Father. Right?
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.800]   So if you've seen Him, you've seen the Father. That's what this means. Right? He's not just
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:11.880]   saying that He's an imprint of Him. He's saying He is Him. So one, so we're talking about
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:16.720]   who is Jesus. One, He's the image of the Father. Two, He's the firstborn of a creation. So
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.000]   a lot of people who read this, again, this is one of those things that you have to do
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.040]   a little bit more digging of context. So again, so that you don't end up in Paris. You have
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:33.280]   to know what do they mean? Right? What did they mean? So firstborn in our culture, when
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:41.040]   we say firstborn, secondborn, thirdborn, we exclusively, 100% of the time, we use it chronologically.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.680]   I'm firstborn. Right? An only child doesn't say I'm firstborn. You just say I'm only child.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:52.160]   Because whenever we say firstborn, we mean there's a second or thirdborn. This period
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.800]   of time when they said firstborn, the word firstborn meant something more than that.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:04.360]   Right? As an example today, if somebody says He's the baby of our home, it means, it can
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.760]   mean two things. One is, chronologically, He's the last. Right? But what's the other
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:16.440]   meaning behind that? How can somebody be using that word? He's the baby of our home. Hmm?
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:22.400]   Okay. Depending on the most needy. Okay. I was thinking, I was thinking something else.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.320]   That could be it. That's what the, right? What else could it mean when you say He's
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:34.640]   the baby? Yes, youngest, chronologically, it could mean that. But what else does it
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:45.280]   mean? He's cherished. Right? I was like, none of you thought of that? What's wrong with
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:50.800]   you people? So when you, I'm not saying that that's what it means. I'm saying that's what
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:56.080]   a parent could mean. That's how it could be understood. Oh, He's baby. Right? He's baby
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:01.080]   or He's cherished at home. Right? So in the same way, in that culture, when they say they're
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:07.120]   firstborn, firstborns naturally receive double portion of all the inheritance. Now, if you're
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.160]   second, third, fourthborn, you might look at that and say, well, that's not fair just
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.560]   because he was born first. The reason why the firstborn was given double the portion
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:20.480]   was because he had the responsibility to carry the family line. So if you were Abraham's
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.520]   descendant, whatever promises that was made, the firstborn was the one that was going to
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.640]   receive that promise and go down that line. Even if you did not receive the covenant from
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:36.040]   God, that family line's name. So 10 generations from now, what happens to the firstborn and
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.800]   then his firstborn and then his firstborn was going to be the line that's going to connect
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:46.000]   back to 10 generations earlier. So they gave him double the portion so that he would have
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.840]   double the chance of being successful because it didn't just mean for him. It meant he had
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:59.240]   the responsibility on his shoulder to carry his family line generation to generation.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:04.480]   So in that culture, when they said firstborn, it doesn't, it didn't just mean in first,
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:10.880]   second, third, right? Chronologically. It meant that there was a special anointing upon
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:16.840]   him. So when he says Jesus is the firstborn of creation, he's not talking about chronologically.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.960]   He was first and came second and then third. He's saying he's firstborn, meaning that there
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:28.560]   is a special burden upon him of all the creation. So he, in other words, it's the cult, the
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:35.280]   culture at that time would have understood this as he is what? Premier. He is above.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:41.800]   He is special of all the creations. Okay. Not necessarily chronological. So when he
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:48.880]   says for God to love the world that he gave his only begotten son, right? Okay. That's
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.640]   not the verse I was thinking about. Okay. I went somewhere else. Okay. Completely erase
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.560]   that. Completely erase that. Okay. So when the Bible talks about him being firstborn,
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:03.200]   right? In reference to Jesus, not talking about chronologically. So one, he is the image
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.640]   of God, meaning he's God himself. He is firstborn over creation. In other words, he is above
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:12.480]   all the creation and then that's exactly what he talks about, right? Starting from verse
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:18.780]   three, "For by him all things were created." Right? Now, he just said he is preeminent
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:26.600]   above all creation and then he explains why. Because he's the creator himself. All things
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.920]   were created, all things through him were created, both the heavens and the earth, visible
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.640]   and invisible, throne and rulers and authorities. So we can sit here and dissect, you know,
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.920]   authorities and dominions, visible, invisible. But the point of this section is simply to
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:51.280]   say everything that was created was created by him. Right? Seen, unseen. Heaven, earth.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.880]   All authorities, all dominions, everything that you can possibly think of is under his
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:01.840]   rule. He is preeminent of all creation. He's the firstborn of all creation. Okay? It's
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:14.000]   on his shoulder. All things were created through him and for him. So the purpose, he is God,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.800]   he is preeminent, he's the creator. And not only did he create everything, he said everything
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:26.520]   was created for him. He didn't create us so that we can enjoy life. He created us for
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:37.240]   what purpose? That we would worship him. We weren't created to be worshipped. I mean,
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:44.480]   think carefully how much of our life is dedicated in desiring to be worshipped. Wanting to be
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.600]   the best basketball player, wanting to be the tallest, the best looking, make the most
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:56.680]   money, live in the nicest house, want to be famous, whatever it may be. Even as Christians.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:01.080]   I want to be the best Christian. I want to memorize the most scripture. I want to evangelize
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:06.440]   the most. I want to be the most sacrificial. If we're not careful, even the ambition to
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:12.280]   be the best Christian is a, if you're not careful, could be motivated by a desire to
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:18.440]   be worshipped within the Christian camp. And that's why Paul calls that out in 1 Corinthians
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:24.840]   13. Even if I give my body to be burned, if I do not have love, it means nothing. Because
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:32.440]   it can be motivated by a selfish, rebellious nature. Even martyrdom for glory. Whose glory?
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:39.440]   His glory or her glory. So he says all things were created by him and ultimately it's for
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:46.680]   him. And then finally he is before all things and in him all things hold together. Right?
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:52.320]   Not only is it about him, the only way that we can even be sustained is if he's the one
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:59.120]   who sustains us. In other words, all of this in creation, right, summarizes who he is.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:04.080]   So when we say God-centered worship, the moment it's not God-centered, it means absolutely
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:10.000]   nothing. We join the rebellion. This is not an option between this church is about God-centeredness,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:17.360]   this is about the lost. The moment is no longer God-centered, you are part of the rebellion.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:24.680]   You're no longer in accord with what the scripture says we are. Right? Even the way we do church,
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:33.560]   it's about us. My need, my desire, their need, their desire, right? No. Our desire went astray.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:40.440]   Because we rebelled against God. When God forgives us and restores us back into his
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:48.240]   lordship, even our desires are corrected. Right? We, you know, in our generation we
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:53.680]   talk a lot about how homosexuality is sinful, which it is. Absolutely. If there's anybody
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:25:00.600]   who struggles with the theory of that, although the Bible doesn't teach that, absolutely wrong.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.720]   The Bible is crystal clear. There is no debate about it. Only reason why there's a debate
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:10.680]   is because there's a camp that doesn't want it to be true. But if you subject, objectively
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.660]   look at it, the Bible is not ambiguous about it. There are some things that could be debated.
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:19.920]   That is not one of the issues that could be debated. But, but the problem is, because
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:26.600]   we debate about the homosexuality issue, we think that that in and of itself, and we forget
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:34.920]   that even heterosexual desires have been perverted. It's not just homosexual desires. Even the
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:41.640]   people who are not homosexuals have perverted desires. Our desire for fame, money, sex,
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:47.160]   all of that has been perverted. So when God forgives us of our sins and he restores us
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:52.240]   back to his kingdom, he's trying to not only restore us back to his kingdom, but even our
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:59.560]   very desires are to be redeemed. And then all of a sudden our desires become redeemed
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:09.720]   for what he purposed, for his glory. Thirdly, who is Jesus in the light of the church? He
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:18.240]   is also the head of the church. Now I want you to watch this. He talks about what he
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:23.640]   did for us. He redeemed us. He talks in detail what he did. And then he talks about creation.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:29.360]   He doesn't say here, but it's assumed. All things were made by him and for him, sustained
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:35.000]   through him. He doesn't say it here, in between here, but it's assumed. Though that's what
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.600]   God intended, mankind is in rebellion against God. Right? He doesn't say those words in
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.720]   between these words, but we know that. So when he says, and all of a sudden he jumps
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:52.560]   to the church, what is the church in this redemptive plan? What creation is doing God
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:59.840]   is trying to restore through the church. So the word church basically means a assembly
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:05.200]   of called out people. It basically means assembly. This is not a new Christian word that all
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:11.700]   of a sudden appeared out of nowhere. The word church was used to describe a sacred assembly.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:18.980]   So it was used during the Greek period to talk about their Congress. When the senators
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:23.680]   would gather together and separate themselves from the common people to gather together
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.320]   to do a sacred thing to take care of their country, they called that the church. A gathering
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:36.440]   of called out people. That same word is used to describe the assembly of Christians. People
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:42.680]   who have been called out from common, whatever was before, and then gathering together for
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:48.080]   a specific purpose. That's the word that is used for the church. Now why does he introduce
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:55.400]   that? Because the purpose of the church is to redeem what was lost in creation through
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:04.840]   the church. So he's creating a new people. Right? He's creating a new gathering of people
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:12.320]   because the gathering of people, what did that lead to in creation? Judgment. Power
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.680]   of Babel. That's what that was. They gathered together, they assembled together. What did
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:22.880]   they do? They would challenge God. So he scatters them. Right? So they all scatter and all of
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   a sudden Jesus Christ comes and he dies on the cross and then those people that he scatters,
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:35.600]   what does he do? What's the first thing that happens? In Acts chapter 2. Remember in Tower
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:41.200]   of Babel they're all speaking and in one language and they're all in unison. What do they use
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:48.340]   that for? Rebellion against God. When the second Adam comes in Christ and he establishes
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:52.920]   kingdom in the church, what's the first thing that happens? He gathers all these people
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.840]   with different languages and then through the speaking of tongues they were speaking
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:02.160]   to understand each other. So what was happening there? He's reversing the curse of the Babel
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:11.420]   in the church. That make sense? So he's regrouping what was lost through the church and that's
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:16.200]   why he says the manifold wisdom of God is being proclaimed through the church because
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:23.320]   the church is the catalyst for salvation of the world. He's creating a new people. Now
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:29.640]   why is this so significant? Because the church, you hear more and more people say I love Jesus
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:37.480]   but I don't love the church. Right? You can't be a Christian if you don't love the church
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:43.480]   because Jesus is the head of the church. That's just like saying I love your head but the
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:50.520]   rest of you I don't want. Right? I want to marry your head. I guess I'm not disconnect
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:59.440]   your head from your neck. So when we get married, as weird as that is, that's exactly what people
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.040]   say because they don't know what they're talking about. You cannot separate the head from the
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:12.080]   body. Right? Because the body is God's purpose of salvation. So he says he is the head of
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:22.120]   the church. Second, he's the beginning. Meaning he's the one who initiated it. A church did
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:27.680]   not come and all of a sudden she said I'm going to own this. He says I will, right?
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:37.480]   I will, but I will establish my church and the gates of Hades were not forbidden against
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.200]   it. So his intent, he says to make disciples of all the nations but what's the purpose
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:47.800]   of making disciples? Is to build his church. So making disciples and building his church
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:54.400]   are not independent things. Right? This is why the second book that we read is the master
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.880]   plan for the church. Because if you don't understand God's intent for the church and
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.240]   you don't understand the involvement of the church in our salvation and glorifying God
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.640]   and worshiping, then again it's like worshiping the head but I don't want the body. Right?
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:16.880]   You cannot be connected to Christ if you're not connected to the church. He is the firstborn
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:24.760]   from the dead. Right? Now here, again the word firstborn could be used chronologically
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:28.480]   when it's talking about Christ, it's talking about his preeminence. Here it's used both
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:34.560]   ways. Right? He's a preeminent over all things, the living and the dead. But here when he
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.840]   says he created the church, he started the church, well how did he do it? He died and
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:45.120]   he resurrected. And so he was the first that came back from the dead with a new glorified
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:52.320]   body and he paved the way for all of the other new creation to follow his same path to build
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:32:00.020]   a new creation in the church. Does that make sense? What was corrupted and lost in creation,
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:04.880]   he reverses the curse through the church, through his death and resurrection, so when
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:09.160]   he's the first from the dead, he basically kicks the door open that we could not open
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:15.500]   because of our sins. And so now when we get baptized, we are baptized, right, in union
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:20.880]   with his death, but we are also united with him in his resurrected life. So he's the first
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:27.680]   from the dead and then we will be second, third, fourth, and fifth. So that he himself
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:32.900]   will have the first place in everything. So again, back to his intent. The purpose of
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:37.880]   all of this is not simply so that you can be free and then yes, he kicked the door,
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:42.800]   we can, we're free to do whatever we want. He said no, the purpose of this is to establish
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:52.920]   Christ as King, because that's what was lost at the fall. Now before I go any further,
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:33:01.420]   you know, this rubs some people the wrong way. This seems egotistical. Why does he tell
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:06.560]   us to humble ourselves and then he keeps saying, you know, glorify him, it's only about him,
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:16.120]   it's all about him, everything is about him. First, because it is, because it is, because
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.280]   that's the truth. We're not like taking a bunch of different things and say, well we're
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:28.600]   going to choose God to be the best. He created us. He has the power of life and death. And
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:37.160]   if he is not glorified, we die. So think about it, I mentioned this before in sermons many
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:42.480]   times, but if we've been created for the purpose of worship, when we function the way God created,
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:48.560]   that's when we experience the greatest life. The greatest, when you experience the greatest
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:54.240]   life is when you see something that you worship. That's why we're idol worshippers. The only
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:01.920]   difference is which idol we worship. Because we were created for the purpose of worship.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:10.300]   So when we worship, when we worship God, there's nothing beyond God. Because every other idol
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.200]   you worship, something else comes up and that idol looks better and that idol looks better
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.840]   and you jump from idol to idol to idol, from time to time, generation, circumstance to
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:23.400]   circumstance. But when you become the worshipper of the living God, there is nothing to jump
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:30.200]   to. Because you're worshipping the highest being. You're worshipping there is nothing
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:39.640]   greater than that. Right? You worship Kobe, there comes LeBron. I don't know who's up
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:45.320]   after that, Zion. Something's going to come and take its place because eventually it erodes,
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:49.920]   they're eventually not going to be objects of worship, they're going to disappoint. But
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:56.680]   when you worship God, it's permanent and it is eternal. And no matter how long we exist,
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.080]   we're going to be gazing at God and there's going to be more things to be able to worship
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:08.840]   God for eternity. That's how much his glory is. He doesn't fade, he's immutable for eternity.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.480]   We're going to be turning around and there's something else to worship that way. It's just
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.840]   going to go deeper and deeper and deeper. That's who God is. He's eternal. His glory
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:23.120]   is eternal. Right? And so if God created us for that, when we are restored back to worshipping
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:31.840]   God, it's not egotistical. When he is glorified, we live. So all he is doing is restoring life
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:37.800]   for us. And if that bothers you, it's because innately you're not a worshipper of God. Because
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.840]   if you are a worshipper of God, you would recognize that that's when you feel the most
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:47.800]   alive. And this, I'm not just talking theory, I'm already telling you something you already
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:56.480]   know if you're a believer. Fourthly, who is Jesus in the light of his father? For it was
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.420]   the father's good pleasure. Right? He didn't do this reluctantly. There's a fullness to
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:05.600]   dwell in him. So this was another question that came up. Fullness to dwell in him, it
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:10.560]   wasn't like God didn't give him a portion. He's not just a representative or image of
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:18.900]   his goodness or image of his kindness. All that is about God is in Christ. So we look
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.620]   at Christ and say, "Well, he was so gracious he died and the God of the Old Testament,
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:28.880]   the father, is so vengeful because he wiped out the world and Jericho and he did all of
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.680]   that. But Jesus comes and he dies on the cross, so it seems like Jesus and God the father
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:41.680]   seem like different sides. Well, he says, "No, all the fullness of God dwelt in Christ."
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:47.360]   He hates sin just as much as the father. The father loves sinners just as much as Christ.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:52.640]   If you've seen Jesus, you've seen the father. So if there's something about God you didn't
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.280]   understand, the more you study Christ, the more you understand the father too and the
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:03.640]   Holy Spirit. So the fullness of God dwells in him. And through him to reconcile all things
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:10.720]   to himself. That's the goal. Reconciliation is the goal because every problem that we
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.960]   have is because we've fallen away from the author of life. So if you've fallen away from
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:25.840]   the author of life and you are trying to live, you're faking it. That's why if you say you're
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.720]   a believer and you have no relationship with Jesus Christ, you have to take a step back
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:40.600]   and ask, "Have I been reconciled?" Because that's what it means to be saved, to be reconciled
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:48.960]   to the father. So if there's no affection, like zero, you love the gathering of people
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:56.200]   more than Jesus himself. And I know there's times where we can be distracted. I know there's
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:04.600]   times that, you know, our hearts not as vibrant as it ought to be. But if your continual walk
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:11.320]   in life, you love the gathering of people more than God himself. You have to take a
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:18.640]   step back and ask yourself, "Have I been reconciled with this father?" If he is as glorious as
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:26.480]   the Bible says, why do I not? Why is that not my conviction? Because your sanctification
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:38.600]   depends on it. The word of God is so, so, so boring if you don't know Jesus. I mean,
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:45.400]   think about it. He's the image of the invisible God. He reconciled us, rescued us, placed
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:52.520]   us into his kingdom. I mean, to somebody whose eyes has not been opened and hasn't tasted
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:58.040]   the goodness of God, oh my gosh. Have you ever tried studying theology before you were
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:06.840]   a Christian? Made no sense to me. Zero. I mean, I went to vacation Bible school all
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:13.680]   my life. Memorized scripture, never missed any Sunday. I mean, I'm third generation pastor,
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:19.360]   Christian family, so I can't remember a single day that I missed church. Every time I opened
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:25.080]   up the Bible, none of it made sense to me. Nor did I have any desire. Only reason why
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:32.240]   I did it was because you got candy for memorizing scripture, so I did it. And don't get me wrong,
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:38.880]   I'm thankful that I did it, because all those candies that I sucked on eventually, after
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.560]   I became a Christian, it was in my head. So I don't think there's anything wrong with
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:49.520]   that, right? But that's all it meant to me when I wasn't a Christian. So non-Christian,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:55.320]   as soon as you open up the Bible, I mean, it is boring. All of a sudden your eyes get
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:00.640]   open. This Jesus that we're studying is not a theory, is not somebody far off. This is
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:05.760]   the Jesus that you met. This is Jesus that you're longing to see. And all of a sudden
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:12.000]   you're not studying theory or theology. You're studying your Savior, who loved you and died
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.720]   for you, where you feel life and joy and purpose. And all of a sudden the Word of God starts
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:23.560]   to make sense, right? Even the hard parts, it's like finding a puzzle and trying to bring
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:28.840]   it together, right? And only the Holy Spirit can open his eyes to that. So through him,
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:35.060]   reconciling, having made peace through the blood of the cross, through him, right? Having
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:41.440]   peace with God. One of the questions that I asked is, where does anxiety come from,
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.360]   right? Ultimately, ultimately, I'm not saying that you can't be anxious about your finance,
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:51.400]   your future, but ultimately anxiety comes from being disconnected with God. Because
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.480]   God is sovereign, he's in control. Anxiety comes because you're not, you're uncertain
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:02.120]   about the future. You're uncertain about what's going to happen, right? You're uncertain that
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.560]   you want something and it's not going to happen. But when you believe in a sovereign God who
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.960]   loves you, cares for you, who is in control of all things, I'm not saying that we don't
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:16.600]   struggle with anxiety, but anxiety is not what characterizes your life. When you have
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:22.480]   peace with God, God gives you the peace of God. Because you know that whatever happens
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.920]   in your life is in God's hands. But if you don't believe that, that's where anxiety comes
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.480]   from, because you have no control over what happens tomorrow. If I do this, and what if
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:34.560]   I don't get that? If I do this, and what if I don't receive that? Then what happens in
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:40.160]   my life? If you don't believe in a sovereign God who loves you and has control, he was
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.080]   willing to send his only son to die for you. How will he not along with him give you all
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:50.920]   things? So if you believe in that, all of a sudden God gives you peace. When anxiety
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:57.080]   comes, he's in control. What you meant for evil, God meant for good. So the peace of
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:05.520]   God, right? Peace with God gives you the peace of God. So Christian can feel anxious, but
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:13.040]   anxiousness cannot be the primary character of a Christian, if you believe in a sovereign
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:21.560]   God. Because it's illogical to say he loved me enough to send his only begotten son, but
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:29.920]   he doesn't love me enough to provide for my needs. It makes absolutely no sense. So he
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:35.120]   says he came having made peace through the blood of his son Jesus Christ. I say whether
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.920]   things on earth or things in heaven, in other words, there's nothing that is outside of
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:46.040]   God's sovereign hands. We went through it pretty quick, but I mean it's pretty heavy
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:52.920]   stuff, but every single part of this, again, like I said, if I wanted to really jump into
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:57.080]   it and to dissect all of this, this would probably take at least four weeks to do. But
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:03.560]   the goal of the study is to get you to seek insight for yourselves. None of the stuff
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:08.840]   that we went through now is something that you have to read a commentary to get. The
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:13.840]   more you sit in front of your Bible asking questions and seeking observations, jotting
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:19.280]   down notes, eventually you become better and better at it, and you'll see a lot of the
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.240]   things that you observe, and then you go to the commentaries and he's saying the same
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:29.160]   thing, right? So my goal is to get you to be confident to be able to study the Word
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:34.760]   of God so that you can compare your notes with the commentary instead of getting your
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:39.840]   notes from the commentary. Okay? All right, so the four questions, discussion question
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:48.000]   three, why is it important to be precise about Jesus' identity? Can someone be saved if they
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.840]   reject Jesus as the second person of the Trinity? If you're a Jehovah Witness and say he's not
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:44:02.640]   God, he's just a God, can that person be saved? Use scripture, and please if you're a small
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:08.680]   group leader don't let that discussion go completely off tangent and say, "Oh yeah!"
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:14.240]   So you're small group leaders because we're hoping you will guide this conversation. All
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.160]   right? Three, have you been reconciled to God? What are some things you would expect
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:24.840]   from a reconciled relationship with anyone? Not just delivered from domain of darkness,
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:31.840]   but you've been transformed to the kingdom of his son, right? By redemption from forgiveness
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:36.240]   of sins. So what does that reconciliation look like with God? Do you have peace with
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.040]   God which leads to peace of God? How do you explain anxiety when God says he's given us
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:44.480]   peace? What do you think is the source of this anxiety? Okay? All right, let me pray
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:54.240]   for us and then you can get in your small group. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:45:01.640]   time. I pray for the time of discussion will be fruitful. I pray, Lord God, that the things
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.880]   that we've studied that we would not just leave it with knowledge and tickling our ears,
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:11.080]   that we would not just be hearers, but to be doers of your word. In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:11.120]   Amen.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:11.960]   Amen.
