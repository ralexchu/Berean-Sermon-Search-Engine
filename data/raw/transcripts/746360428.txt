[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.840]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 3, I'm going to be reading starting
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.360]   from verse 3 down to verse 9.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.400]   But we're going to be dealing with the whole section all the way up to verse 14 today.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.920]   Luke chapter 3, verses 3 to 9.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.040]   "And he came into the district around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.040]   for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.560]   And it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, 'The voice of one
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.960]   crying in the wilderness, "Make ready the way of the Lord.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.240]   Make his path straight; every ravine will be filled, and every mountain and hill will
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.640]   be brought low.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.160]   The crooked will become straight, and the rough roads smooth, and all flesh will see
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.840]   the salvation of God.'
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.520]   So he began saying to the crowds who were going out to be baptized by him, 'You brood
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.120]   of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, "We
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.720]   have Abraham for our father."
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.640]   For I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.320]   Indeed the axe is already laid at the root of the tree, so every tree that does not bear
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.080]   good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.'"
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.920]   Let's pray.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:26.600]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your Holy Spirit's power to move us, guide us, open our ears
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.240]   that we may hear from you, soften our hearts that we may be easily molded to be what you
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.240]   desire us to be.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.400]   You are the potter, we are the clay, and we are ready to hear your word.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.240]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.640]   You know, I didn't mention the two things I, again I forgot to mention is next Sunday
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.240]   the cry room is going to be moved to the other side, okay?
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.240]   We're trying to prepare for the students coming and so we're going to get all that ready by
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.240]   this week.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.900]   And so starting from next Sunday we're going to be having the cry room.
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.400]   So we're setting up the different places.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.840]   It'll be a little bit easier to, if you have children you need to watch.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.720]   There's going to be a big screen set up, so just kind of be ready for that.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.240]   And then we're going to be opening up that area, at least the windows are going to be
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.520]   gone and we're going to take extra seats to be seated over there.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.440]   So that's starting next week.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.040]   The other thing is we're picking up India Mission trip again this winter and so the
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.560]   dates are January 20th through 28th.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.280]   We only have a few more spots left and so there's going to be a short trip where we
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.760]   leave on the 20th, come back on the 20th and come back on the 28th.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.640]   If you are an eye doctor, we need you more than ever so you'll get first priority because
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.720]   that's the main work that we're doing.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.560]   You don't have to be an eye doctor.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.520]   It is a medical mission trip but we need more assistance than doctors normally but it just
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.400]   happens that this year we need some more eye doctors to go.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.680]   So if you're able to go, please let me know.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.840]   And because there's only a small space, I actually need to know today.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.280]   So during service just raise your hand and I'll know, okay?
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.320]   So actually Cross Life has always joined us in this and so they're going to tell me a
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.560]   few people that they're able to go so we're going to have to lock up the spots today.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.720]   So if God is speaking to you now, right, just as soon as possible if this is on your heart
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.040]   and again especially if you're an eye doctor, please let us know, okay?
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.660]   Well along with that, you know years ago when we first started going out to India, we were
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.520]   actually warned not to go and the reason why is because this place that we were going was
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.640]   so deep in the boonies that even the missionaries who were stationed down in the big city in
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.300]   Bangalore were telling us that they don't venture out beyond two hours because after
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.880]   two hours the area is not developed.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.680]   There's Hindu nationalists who basically has free reign and they're telling us that this
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.440]   road is going to take us five hours into the boonies and so if something happens, it's
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.880]   going to be very difficult to get us out because there's nobody there to help us.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.440]   So you know, prayed about it and we thought this work is important enough and so I remember
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.980]   the first year we did go, you know, we had the pastors not just here but outside the
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.640]   church praying for us and those of you, there's some of you who are here that went that first
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.880]   year in particular, we kind of had to tell people to make sure you get everything in
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.880]   order.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.600]   You know, if something happens, make sure that you know, that people are able to be
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.520]   prepared and I remember before I left, I had to leave like, you know, make sure Esther
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.680]   knew where all the bank accounts were.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.320]   There's nothing hidden and then so you know, I didn't want to scare her but at the same
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.340]   time where we were going was not a safe place to go.
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.360]   And so when we got there, we got on onto a car and about there was about an hour worth
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.500]   of road that was paved and after that it was like basically one road, dirt road, another
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.580]   four hours into deep part of where we were going and all of us, even though we're laughing
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.960]   and having fun, we're a bit nervous.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.000]   You know, we're nervous because we don't know if something does happen here, you know, man,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.260]   this is a long way to go on this dirt road to come back.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.840]   And so, you know, that's kind of how it started and so obviously each year we got more, more
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.680]   accustomed and so one of the things that I've noticed through the years, especially in the
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.040]   last maybe about three to four years, that there was a big sign, I think starting from
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.860]   the second year that Hyundai was coming.
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.460]   So you know, before all the factories were out in China and Vietnam and so a lot of them
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.300]   are starting to come into India and Hyundai bought a huge, you know, part of land over
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.580]   there and so every year we went, we saw a little bit more, a little bit more being developed
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.540]   and now when we take that road, it's become actually one of the best highways, better
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.540]   than here.
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.180]   It's like four lane highways on both sides and because it's headed out to nowhere other
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.900]   than to Hyundai that it usually doesn't have much traffic.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.020]   So you have what used to take us about five and a half hours to get to where we go, now
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.540]   it's about three and a half and it saved us maybe about an hour, hour and a half of driving
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.220]   and right up to Hyundai, you know, right all of a sudden in the middle of nowhere you'll
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.060]   see Korean barbecue, you know, Korean spa, Korean, you see Korean signs everywhere in
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.660]   the middle of India, you know, and then all the roads right up to that and then right
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.880]   as you pass Hyundai, it gets back to the old roads, you know.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.380]   Obviously we knew something important was coming because of these roads, right?
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:33.400]   Hyundai has invested so much money right there and then they said over 30,000 people who
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.560]   have come just to work in that area and obviously they're, you know, wealthy people, executives
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.560]   and so they have to build all this infrastructure just to get this company to come in.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.820]   Obviously you know where I'm going with this, right?
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.340]   This road was invested because without these roads you can't get there.
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:56.020]   The text says in Luke 3, 4 to 6, that was the whole purpose of John the Baptist.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.260]   Before Christ can come, John the Baptist was sent ahead of him to prepare the best roads
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.940]   to get to the Messiah and the way it was explained, he says, every ravine will be filled and every
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.740]   mountain and hill will be brought low, the crooked will become straight and the rough
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.720]   road smooth and all flesh will see the salvation of God.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.940]   So he was to basically prepare the road for the coming of the Messiah.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.300]   So when we think of John the Baptist's ministry, right, when he comes on the scene, he doesn't
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.780]   come with a shovel, right?
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.320]   Their caterpillar, you know, wasn't there at that time.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.980]   So what did he do?
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.920]   He doesn't hold any office.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.840]   In fact, there's no record of John the Baptist performing any miracles.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.740]   So this that he's been called to do, to do, you know, basically lower the mountains and
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.180]   fill the ravines, all of this was by one thing.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.100]   All we know about John the Baptist that he was a preacher.
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.240]   The way he was going to prepare for the coming of Christ, the way he was going to prepare
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.440]   the road that's going to lead to Christ was through his preaching.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.980]   And so we need to recognize what his preaching was.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:13.420]   If his preaching and his message was primarily to get us to God, what was the content of
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.620]   his preaching?
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.420]   His preaching is described for us in that prophecy of Isaiah as voice of one crying
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.020]   in the wilderness, crying in the wilderness.
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.660]   You know, the funny story about when we were doing construction in this building, we had
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.380]   contractors here, you know, putting windows and fortifying that room over there.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:40.500]   And it used to be a racquetball court in that room that where everybody's in right now.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.860]   And they would ask him, what is this room for?
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.020]   Why are you putting windows here?
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.480]   And I told them that it's a cry room.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.780]   And you can see the confusion on their face, like, oh, cry room, cry room.
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.980]   And they didn't ask me right away, but eventually they got, they were curious and it's like,
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.380]   cry room?
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.420]   You have a separate room for people to cry?
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.900]   And it never dawned on me that that's how they would hear it because they're not Christians.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.260]   And so I initially, I was like, you know, for the babies, right?
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.260]   And then it's like, huh?
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.420]   And so now I have to explain to them, so, you know, young parents who have young children
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.060]   and if they cry, so we call it the cry room, but it's really for parents with young children.
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.780]   It's like, oh, that's what that means, right?
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.820]   When he says crying in the wilderness, it's not just referring to John the Baptist went
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.180]   to the wilderness and just cried all day.
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:34.240]   Crying meaning like he was proclaiming with passion, crying, like crying out loud.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.220]   That his preaching was not just nonchalant.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:42.380]   And you know, when I think of John the Baptist being described as preaching, crying out,
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:48.700]   I think of Jonah, you know, the prophet, maybe exactly the opposite, you know, a reluctant
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:55.620]   prophet who literally had to have his arms twisted to go into Nineveh and preach a message
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.140]   of repentance, knowing that if they repented, that God would forgive them.
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.580]   And he didn't want God to forgive them.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:09.180]   So when he went to Nineveh, I would imagine that Jonah was not crying.
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.180]   Exactly the opposite.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:14.900]   He whispered, you know, as he was walking along, it's like, "Have you ever repented
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.380]   or God might forgive you?"
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.380]   Right?
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.380]   He said, "I did my job!"
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.220]   Somebody who is saying something that they really don't care, they're just going to do
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.460]   the absolute minimum.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:29.580]   I can see Jonah is the exact opposite of John the Baptist.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:35.260]   And despite the fact this weak preacher, revival broke out in Nineveh.
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:40.500]   Well, John the Baptist was sent and he was crying out and he was pleading with the nation
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.460]   of Israel to prepare for his coming.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.300]   But his primary message, in fact, we don't have many things that we know about what John
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.740]   the Baptist said.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.700]   His primary message is recorded in verse three.
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.980]   It says, "He preached the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins."
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.020]   In a nutshell, that was his own message.
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.380]   Baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:10.220]   Now, preaching repentance is not new to John the Baptist.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.660]   If you study any part of the Old Testament prophets, their primary message was the same
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.660]   thing.
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.140]   If you do not repent, judgment is coming.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.620]   That's their primary message.
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.980]   Almost every prophet had the same message.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.380]   That because you've rebelled against God, yet you do not obey his commandment, judgment
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.160]   is coming.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.940]   But what makes John the Baptist's preaching unique?
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.340]   They called it the baptism of repentance.
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:41.420]   Again, in order to understand exactly what's going on, why baptism of repentance is described
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:48.660]   to his message, is baptism, the ceremony in and of itself, was not created new from John
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.660]   the Baptist.
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:54.820]   In fact, that ceremony of being dunked into the water and come out, in fact, the word
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.280]   "baptizo" basically means to dunk, right?
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:05.500]   That ceremony was kind of similar to what we do today in our society, like an invocation
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.180]   or dedication.
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:12.000]   Many of you who are in the medical field, after you graduate and before you become,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.580]   you know, like sent out to do your work, you have a white coat ceremony where they put
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.300]   that coat on you, and that's to kind of separate you from your civilian life so that you can
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.260]   serve the people.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:30.060]   And so it's an act of dedication, that now you're getting special permission to do this
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.060]   work.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:36.020]   Well, baptism ceremony itself at that time in the secular world was used kind of like
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.020]   an invocation.
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:45.380]   And in particular, when somebody decided to serve as a servant in politics in Athens,
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.620]   they would have the ceremony signifying that they're putting down their civilian life and
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.200]   they're taking on this public life to serve.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.380]   So they're no longer civilians, but they are being ordained specifically to serve their
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.380]   people.
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.440]   Now, that's what baptism was for.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.040]   And the reason why they dunked is to signify exactly what it signifies to us, that your
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.360]   old life is dead and that now you're going to begin to live a new life.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.120]   So just by saying baptism, people would have understood that that's what it is, is a special
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.380]   dedication.
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:22.340]   But John's baptism is not just described as baptism, but the baptism of what?
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.840]   Repentance.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.160]   It wasn't just an invocation.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.960]   It wasn't just a dedication.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.600]   But baptism, the word in and of itself, metanoia, means to change your mind.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.720]   So meaning it wasn't just an external where you are living externally one way, and then
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.480]   now you've taken upon yourself a new job.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:47.160]   It required repentance, a complete transformation and putting away internally and externally
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.080]   your old life and receiving a new life.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:57.800]   In fact, John became so prominent in his generation, Josephus, a Jewish historian who's not a Christian,
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.600]   who recorded much of what was going on in Christianity at that time.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.280]   Josephus in his writing actually mentions John the Baptist, and he says this, "John's
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.320]   baptism required a cleansed soul."
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.660]   You know, all the other baptism, it was just, they were just kind of going from dedication
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.040]   from one way of life to a new way of life externally.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.860]   But it says John's baptism required a cleansed soul.
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:28.680]   Even Josephus, a non-Christian historian watching what was going on, understood what it meant
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.600]   to proclaim baptism of repentance.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.600]   I think one of the best illustrations that I see in the New Testament of true repentance
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.120]   is Apostle Paul, you know, where he, before he met Christ, you know, he was willing to
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.640]   murder in the name of God, thinking that he's doing God a favor.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:53.640]   But then he meets Jesus and the road to Damascus, and he completely is thrown off.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.200]   Everything that he knew was wrong, and he becomes blind for three days.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.120]   Can you imagine for three days what was going on in his mind?
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.920]   He's probably sifting through the law, that everything he understood about the law may
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.120]   be wrong.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.280]   Everything he understood about the Messiah was wrong.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:15.280]   In fact, everything he did, he committed murder in the name of God, was wrong.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.540]   So after three days, his eyes become open.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.200]   Can you imagine what that must have been like?
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.080]   He no longer saw anything the same way.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.000]   He didn't just see that, oh, I shouldn't have done that.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.360]   Oh, maybe I should have been more vigorous in doing this.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.640]   So everything after he met Christ was completely different.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.740]   In fact, he was so different that even the apostles had a hard time believing.
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.520]   How can this be the same man?
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.880]   How can be this the same guy who took responsibility for the first martyr in the church?
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:51.000]   How can be this guy be the same guy who took soldiers to go and get Christians?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.920]   And it took a while to warm up to his conversion because it was so radical.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:04.440]   See, the idea of repentance, baptism of repentance, is double-fold because baptism in and of itself
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.660]   means conversion.
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:12.120]   But repentance is exponentially above that, not only externally, but internally.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.920]   In every way, he's a completely new creation.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.760]   And that was the preaching of John the Baptist.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:26.200]   He was so effective in his preaching that even leaders traveled far distances, Pharisees,
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:31.440]   Sadducees, scribes, and just regular people started to come out to where he was, to some
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.600]   strange place in the wilderness because of his preaching.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.640]   They knew something was different about him.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.560]   Remember we talked about last week, it says the word of the Lord came to him, and that
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:48.700]   was very specific about an anointed prophet who's going to come and speak for God.
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.900]   So it wasn't that they didn't have the word of God.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:57.300]   At this time, the Septuagint, the Old Testament was translated into Greek, and they had more
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.860]   access to the Bible, the Old Testament, than they ever had in history.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:07.380]   I would say it would be, at least up to that point, it would be very similar to today for
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.780]   us.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:13.820]   We have more access to the written word and the preaching of the written word than we
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:20.540]   have ever, any Christian has ever had in history, ever, especially me and you.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:26.820]   We have, our problem is what translation we should use, what Bible program, what pastor
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.380]   do we like?
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.260]   We can wake up three in the morning and hear the best preachers of our generation, just
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.620]   click of a button, in our car, in our ear, we can download all of that.
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.220]   We have access to the written word of God more than anybody has ever.
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:47.820]   See the period that the first generation Jews had was very similar to that, because there
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.220]   was a period when they didn't have access to the scrolls.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.700]   But during that period where they allowed, the Romans allowed them to practice their
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:00.500]   faith, that they did have access.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:06.620]   But the problem was when Amos said that part of the judgment, and one of the last judgments
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.660]   that's going to come upon the nation of Israel, is that there's going to be the famine of
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.660]   the word.
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.180]   That they're going to be staggering from place to place to hear the word of God, but
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.140]   they're not going to find it.
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.660]   And he wasn't simply talking about they're going to lose the scroll, or they're not going
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.540]   to know what the Old Testament says.
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.640]   They had full access to that.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:31.500]   But they didn't have a man of God speaking, speaking directly to them.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.780]   Again it's much like today where we have the word of God, access to the word of God, but
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:41.160]   we are more ignorant to what the word of God says than probably ever in history.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.680]   When John the Baptist began to speak, people began to recognize this guy is not like the
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.440]   other scribes.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.180]   He's not just regurgitating information.
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.180]   He's not just talking.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.180]   He's not just a learned man.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.020]   They could tell that he was a prophet sent from God.
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:00.340]   And so people out of curiosity began to come, and some very prominent people.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.820]   It doesn't mention here, but in the other gospels it mentions that Pharisees, people
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.060]   with authority, leaders of Israel, were coming to this guy at New Widener.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.740]   Strange guy.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.740]   His diet is weird.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.060]   His dress is weird.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.820]   And then his preaching is different.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.580]   So you would think that when John saw these people who were coming and the crowds were
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:28.380]   growing that being aware of who is in this crowd that John the Baptist may have addressed
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:33.340]   them, saying, "My distinguished guests, thank you for traveling long distances to
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.380]   come here to hear a humble man."
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.980]   You would think that that's what he would say.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.500]   Instead, what does he say?
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:46.460]   "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.140]   Basically, he said, "You snakes!"
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.380]   That's what came out of his mouth.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.780]   These distinguished people were coming to listen to him.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.780]   "You snakes!"
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.460]   In fact, that's probably one of the worst things that you could have called a Jew at
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.460]   that time.
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.420]   Snake is a filthy animal.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:11.660]   But not only is it filthy, historically, snakes is how Satan was presented at the Garden of
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.100]   Eden.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:18.860]   So to call somebody a viper, and again, not only is he a snake, but a viper is venomous
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.700]   and is dangerous to other people.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.860]   He doesn't say it here, but later on, Jesus will call them out and say, "Because of their
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.180]   sins and their hypocrisy, they're ruining all of Israel."
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:32.860]   And he says, "Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees."
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.460]   Leaven is basically another word of saying the poison.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.460]   He goes even deeper than that.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.780]   He doesn't just call them viper.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:46.900]   He says, "You brood of vipers, not only are you a snake, your mom's a snake.
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.020]   Your dad's a snake.
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.180]   Your grandfather's a snake.
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.640]   Your ancestors are snakes.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.460]   You come from a line of snakes."
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:59.140]   So this is the worst, most offensive thing that you could probably say to a Jew.
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.860]   You think about today, what's the worst thing that you can say to somebody?
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.060]   Don't say it, right?
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.540]   Don't even think it too loud, right?
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.540]   Maybe racist.
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:13.500]   I mean, there's a lot of things that we could think of, and in our generation, you can get
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.220]   away with a lot of things, but you call somebody a racist, that's almost like the worst thing
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.420]   you can say, right?
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.060]   Well, he goes straight to the matter.
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.060]   He doesn't mix words.
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.060]   He doesn't build up to that.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.100]   He sees their sins.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.740]   You brood of vipers.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.820]   Jesus himself uses this term repeatedly to the Jews.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:36.040]   Matthew 23, 33, "You serpents, you brood of vipers, how will you escape the sentence
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.700]   of hell?"
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.380]   This encounter with these fake Jews who are saying, who thought that they believed him,
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:46.380]   and Jesus encounters them in John 8, 44, and he goes straight to the matter too.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:53.100]   You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.460]   Why is he so harsh?
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.060]   Why does he, why is he more gentle?
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.380]   He sees right through, and this is what he says in the verse saying, the reason why he
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.380]   is so harsh with them.
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.260]   He says, "Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:14.300]   yourselves, we have Abraham as our father, for I say to you that from these stones God
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.300]   is able to raise up children to Abraham.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.380]   Indeed, the ax is already laid at the root of the tree, so every tree that does not bear
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.820]   good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:32.740]   He's cutting through their hypocrisy because they believed that they were safe, and the
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:41.460]   people who are in the most danger in our generation are people who are in the church, may have
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:46.540]   been baptized superficially, maybe even serving in the church, maybe even leading in some
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:51.220]   sense, and yet they do not know God.
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.740]   They do not know God, and so they can live their whole life thinking that they are in
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:00.860]   the front of the line in the kingdom of God, and yet when the judgment comes, the judgment
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.780]   is the greatest to them.
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:10.780]   John the Baptist was calling through all that fluff, all that deception, and he's cutting
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.780]   right through them.
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.180]   He said, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath that comes?"
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.620]   You know, probably some of them were thinking that if they came, John the Baptist is becoming
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:23.820]   prominent, that so many people are going out to see him, and so they are so committed to
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:28.900]   their own glory that maybe if we attached ourselves to this prophet, maybe that's where
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.460]   we need to be.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.860]   So they were coming out to be baptized without genuinely repenting.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.860]   That's what he means.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.900]   "Who told you to flee?
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.600]   You think that just going into the water and coming out is going to cause you to be right
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.100]   with God because you're descendants of Abraham?"
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.460]   There's a reason why he says, "You brood of vipers."
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.780]   You're not true descendants of Abraham.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:58.320]   The true spiritual descendancy that you're from is Satan himself.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.760]   That's what he means by this.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:07.160]   And he says the consequence of their fake repentance is that the ax is laid down to
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.520]   be cut down and be thrown into the fire.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.120]   Jesus himself says this in John chapter 15.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.320]   "Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away, and every branch that bears
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.320]   fruit, he prunes it so that it may bear more fruit.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.600]   If anyone does not abide in me, and he is thrown away as a branch and dries up, and
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.760]   they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned."
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:36.320]   Now what is the consequence of somebody who has fake repentance and there's no fruit?
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:43.280]   He doesn't say he does not bear any fruit that God is going to put him in timeout.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.160]   He doesn't say if you don't bear any fruit that your repentance is fake.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.080]   It's only external, but there's nothing, no real transformation going on, no real fruit
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.080]   going on.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.920]   He doesn't say you shouldn't be a leader or you need better discipleship.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920]   He doesn't say that.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:03.600]   He said he who bears no fruit, he's going to cut down and be thrown into the fire.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.360]   That doesn't sound like pruning to me.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.080]   That doesn't sound like better discipleship.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.680]   He says no, you're in danger of hell.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.520]   That's what he's saying.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.720]   You can be more clear than that.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:25.600]   Having no fruit or repentance is not just feeling bad.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:31.360]   Call to repentance is not to call to feel bad about what you did this week.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.360]   I feel bad.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.000]   So much sometimes of our repentance is, "Hey, I struggle with pornography," and I say, "I
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   feel bad."
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   But thank God.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.360]   Thank God God is gracious.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.200]   And then you fall, and then you go back two, three days later, and you go through the same
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.520]   act and you go over and over and over, and all you're doing is commiserating with other
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:56.120]   people and never truly repenting.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.080]   Repenting is not feeling bad about the situation that you're in.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:05.520]   Repenting means to turn away, to put that away, to do everything in your power to put
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.720]   that away.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:16.280]   If we actually knew how God feels about sin, we wouldn't be so nonchalant.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:22.940]   You know, I know that there's people in this room who your internal clock is broken, right?
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.880]   And you almost say, "I can't help it."
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.920]   So we may have a meeting at 10, you show up at 10.15 or 10.20.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.280]   It's like almost predictable you're going to be 10, 15 minutes late.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.400]   "I can't help it.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.200]   I can't help it."
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:41.440]   But no matter how broken your internal clock is, if you knew the serious consequence of
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.820]   being late, you will show up on time.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:52.040]   So I don't know anybody who is late to everything else, but is also late to their flight.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.280]   Because if you're late to your flight, the door's closed and you're gone, whatever money
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.160]   you paid is squashed.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.480]   So "I can't help it.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.480]   I can't help it."
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.240]   All of a sudden, you can help it because you're afraid of the consequence.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.000]   "I can't help it.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   I can't help it."
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.080]   And all of a sudden, you show up to work on time because if you don't show up to work
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.280]   on time, you get fired.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.640]   So it's not that you can't help it, but you don't think the consequence is serious enough
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.460]   to get to that point, right?
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:27.440]   If we understood how God views sin, we wouldn't be so nonchalant.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:32.320]   Call to repentance isn't simply, "You should feel bad about where you're at.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.240]   You should feel bad."
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.000]   That's exactly what John the Baptist was cutting through.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.840]   He said, "Go with it.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.400]   Bear fruit with repentance."
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.880]   If you're going to genuinely repent, turn from your sin.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.480]   Instead of just saying, "I feel bad.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.160]   I shouldn't have done that."
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.400]   That's what John is saying.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.600]   Years ago, we were at Together for the Gospel.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.880]   At the Together for the Gospel, they would have the speakers come up and sit in a half
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.520]   circle and they asked a question, Q&A session.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:08.640]   One of the questions that came in from the pastors was, "How would you counsel a guy
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:16.760]   in the church who continues to struggle with pornography and he just can't conquer his
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.120]   sin?
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.360]   What would you counsel him?"
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.960]   And you know what John the Baptist, John Piper, right?
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.200]   I did the same thing at first service.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:34.240]   John Piper basically said, "Tell him he's going to hell."
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:38.960]   The whole room just erupted in laughter, thinking like, "Oh, it must be a joke."
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:44.240]   So hyperbole, you know, John Piper is just kind of joking.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.760]   And after the laughter just started to die down a little bit, he said, "No, I'm dead
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.760]   serious.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.200]   I'm quoting scripture."
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.400]   And then he took out Mark chapter 9, 43, says, "If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   off.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:01.880]   It is better for you to enter life crippled than having your two hands to go into hell,
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:08.360]   into the unquenchable fire where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched."
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:13.280]   Jesus says that about the hand, about the foot, and about the eyes.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:20.320]   And so John Piper basically was answering that maybe he doesn't understand the consequence
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:27.680]   of continuing to sin without true repentance, that it may not be true, that his faith may
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.680]   not be true.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.240]   If he just confesses like, "Oh, yeah, you know, I didn't believe in God, but now I believe
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.240]   in God.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.880]   I wasn't sure about the resurrection, so now I do believe in the resurrection.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.680]   I didn't believe these set of truths, but now I believe in these set of truths.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.160]   And the rest of it is one saved, always saved.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:48.560]   And so how I live, what I do, what I invested, it doesn't matter anymore because one saved,
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.560]   always saved."
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.600]   Pure rubbish.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:58.960]   If we read the scriptures for ourselves and instead of having security over sermons and
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.760]   maybe articles or things that you've heard from other people thinking that your sin does
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.560]   not matter is an outright lie.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:13.520]   The same God who hated sin to the point where he abolished all of creation with the exception
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.160]   of eight is the same God that we will meet when we die.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.160]   He's not a lesser God.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.840]   He's not any less holy than that same God.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.080]   He hates sin equally.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:33.240]   The same God who wiped out the earth warns us that when we meet him, unconfessed, unrepentant,
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:39.200]   it is the same holy, holy, holy God that you will meet.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:45.400]   And if anybody has convinced you otherwise, they are a false prophet.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:50.080]   If you have convinced yourself that that is not the case, you do not know what the scripture
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.480]   says.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:56.600]   There is a reason why John the Baptist cut through all of that bull.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:02.760]   Because in order for them to be saved, they needed to know where they were.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:08.600]   If they left thinking they're secure because they have these external things that they
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:14.720]   are doing, you have given security to somebody who's going to hell.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:20.720]   That's why men of the past who preached the word of God preached with the same kind of
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.360]   vigor.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.960]   John the Baptist preached crying in the wilderness.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:34.880]   He cried because he was crying for their salvation to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.680]   Jonathan Edwards, as you guys know, gave a sermon called "Sinners in the Hands of an
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.200]   Angry God."
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.360]   And it was a catalyst for the great awakening in America.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.240]   Revival broke out.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:53.460]   Consider what we consider a good sermon today versus Jonathan Edwards that caused the revival
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.160]   to break out in this country.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.560]   And I'm only giving you a very small snippet of his sermon.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:06.120]   He says this, "The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:12.200]   or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you and is dreadfully provoked.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.800]   His wrath towards you burns like fire.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.760]   He looks upon you as worthy of nothing else but to be cast into the fire.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.720]   He is of pure eyes and to bear to have you in his sight.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:25.440]   You are ten thousand times more abominable in his eyes than the most hateful venomous
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.140]   serpent is in ours.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:31.680]   You have offended him infinitely more than ever a stubborn rebel did his prince.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.360]   And yet it is nothing but his hand that holds you from falling into the fire.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:40.000]   Every moment is to be ascribed to nothing else that you did not go to hell the last
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.840]   night, that you were suffered to awake again in this world after you closed your eyes to
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.840]   sleep.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.020]   And there is no other reason to be given why you have not dropped into hell since you arose
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.120]   in the morning, but that God's hand has held you up.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:58.600]   There is no other reason to be given why you have not gone to hell since you have sat here
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.960]   in the house of God, provoking his pure eyes by your sinful, wicked manner of attending
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.480]   his solemn worship.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:10.040]   Yea, there is nothing else that is to be given as a reason why you do not this very moment
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.240]   drop down to hell.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.840]   That's a very small portion of his whole sermon, "Sin is in the Hands of an Angry God."
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:22.100]   Josh Moody, who is a historian of Jonathan Edwards, writes about this particular sermon.
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:27.840]   He says this, "On this day in history, Jonathan Edwards started a sermon that he did not finish.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:32.400]   Such was the impact of his preaching that the people listening shrieked and cried out,
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.280]   and crying and weeping became so loud that Edwards was forced to discontinue the sermon.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.500]   Instead, the pastors went down among the people and prayed with them in groups.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.240]   Many came to save knowledge of Christ that day."
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.600]   And it wasn't limited to his church.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:51.840]   Other pastors began to repent and they began to preach warning.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:57.000]   And many, many people began to come and gave their life to Christ during this period.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.760]   In fact, so many people came to Christ and there were so many raw emotions that broke
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:07.080]   out in the middle of these preachings that Jonathan Edwards actually had to write a book
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.880]   to clarify.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.320]   Religious affections.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.460]   What is true repentance?
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.460]   What is fake repentance?
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:18.740]   There's a lot of people who are crying and being baptized and so many things are happening.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:22.440]   So he had to cut through all of that and he had to, if you've ever read that book, half
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.040]   of it is about this is fake.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.040]   You can cry and be fake.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.040]   You can go to church and be fake.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.440]   You can be a leader and be fake.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.480]   You can preach and be fake.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.480]   You can give and be fake.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.080]   You can become a missionary and be fake.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.240]   And then after he does that, he begins to break down.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.160]   What does the Bible say about true repentance?
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.300]   What does true affection look like?
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:47.280]   We have become so familiar with sin in our generation that we are more concerned about
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:53.160]   offending sinners than offending a God who has been offended.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.560]   God is the one who is offended.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.480]   Not me and you.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.400]   You and I have received the grace of God.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.760]   He could have just wiped us away.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.800]   God's the one who's offended.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:12.960]   But we're so concerned that we allow all kinds of sins to exist in the church and so concerned
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:19.320]   about sinners feeling uncomfortable with this type of preaching that we water down and misrepresent
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.600]   this holy God.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:26.040]   There is no reverence of God in our generation because we have had to water it down to allow
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.040]   the sinners to feel comfortable in the midst of our fellowship.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.480]   It is not that God doesn't want sinners in the church.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:38.440]   It is not that God doesn't desire to have the sinners come to Christ, but they must
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.320]   come to Christ in His terms.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.600]   In the terms that He has given us.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.680]   Not what we have created in our generation.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.560]   Not so that majority of them can come without feeling offended, but by the terms that He
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.600]   has created.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:59.600]   And the only way that we can get to Him is through true repentance.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.640]   True repentance.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:07.480]   You cannot live day to day unrepentant and wanting to fit in at church.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:14.360]   You cannot be a part of the fellowship unrepentant week after week, year after year, and desire
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.080]   to be one of the group.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.840]   We cannot.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.980]   This is the body of Christ.
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.520]   This is the temple of God.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.880]   And He who destroys the body, the Bible says the judgment is coming upon Him as well.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:35.440]   Apostle Peter, after the resurrection of Christ, he began to preach the gospel.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:40.400]   And this is a man, before he met the resurrected Christ, was cowering in fear because he was
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.760]   afraid the same thing was going to happen to him.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:47.120]   And yet, after the resurrection, being filled with the Holy Spirit, is speaking in front
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.280]   of a similar crowd that crucified him, says this.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.360]   Men of Israel, listen to these words.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.880]   Jesus of Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs, which
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.640]   God performed through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know, this man delivered
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:07.280]   over by the predetermined plan and for knowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.320]   of godless men and put him to death.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:14.480]   He didn't say, well, some of you guys weren't there, it's not really your fault.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.000]   You know, maybe it was the leader's fault.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.880]   You didn't really mean it.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.440]   You didn't really understand.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:27.480]   He cuts through all of that and said, no, you did it.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.580]   You turned on him.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.880]   You crucified him.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:34.960]   And the reason why he says that is because you can't repent if you don't own up to your
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.520]   own sins.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.360]   If you come to God and say, well, I am the way I am because the way my mom treated me,
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.480]   that's not repentance.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.800]   I am the way I am because my leaders did this.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.600]   That's not repentance.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:52.360]   I did what I did because of my circumstance, because of my past, because I've been backstabbed
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.840]   by my friends, because of the fellowship.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.840]   That's not repentance.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:02.980]   Repentance is coming before God, beating our chest, asking for forgiveness.
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.640]   It was me.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.760]   It was my corrupt nature.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.760]   It was my sin.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.200]   I did it.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.800]   I did it.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.400]   I wanted it.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.400]   I was lustful.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.400]   I was coveting.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.400]   I'm the one who lied.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:20.400]   I, it's me.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:25.360]   Versus the Pharisee who came up and said, well, thank God I'm not as bad as that guy.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:35.120]   See, until we recognize the need, the desperate need of a savior, it's just an encouraging
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.920]   message.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.560]   It's just a security blanket.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:45.000]   It's just insurance just in case, after everything good that we've experienced here so that we
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.680]   can also have everything good afterlife.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:55.520]   But when we actually recognize who we are and what we have done and what we deserve,
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:00.280]   Christ is not somebody to be appreciated from a distance.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.520]   He is our life.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.680]   He's our life.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.680]   Not just for eternity, but for today.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.960]   For today, I need Him.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.080]   The anger, I can't overcome my own anger.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.240]   I need Him.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.760]   I can't overcome my own lust.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.440]   I need Him.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.120]   My bitterness, I can't.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.280]   I need Him.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.240]   I need a savior to save me from my own sins.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:28.680]   When Peter preached this sermon, there are peers to the heart in verse 37, it says, now
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.640]   when they heard this, they were peers to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.720]   apostles, brethren, what shall we do?
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:39.080]   Peter said to them, repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.600]   the forgiveness of your sins.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.600]   He says, repent.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.600]   Compare that to our generation.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.200]   When somebody wants to come to Christ, he said, well, find a good church.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.160]   Make sure you got a small group.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.840]   Make sure there's people your age, similar, that can walk with you, you know, live with
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.840]   you.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:01.760]   You know, like make sure you have similar doctrines and, you know, somebody near you
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.320]   so it's not so inconvenient that you have to drive so far.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.040]   Think about all the things that we tell people.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:14.080]   Again, if all of those things are available, great, blessing to you.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.440]   But the answer that he gave was repent.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.120]   Repent.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.440]   All that you need for a life of godliness has been given to you in the knowledge of
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.680]   His Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.680]   For those of you who already did Bible study, right?
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:34.120]   Everything that you need has been given to you.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:39.040]   So if you're sitting there in want, I can't because of this.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.400]   I can't because of that.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.440]   That's an excuse, unwilling to repent.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:50.220]   If I can't pray, I can't pray because other people are not praying with me.
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.200]   I can't pray because it's too hot in here.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.040]   I can't pray because it's too far.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.920]   I can't pray because I wasn't taught to pray.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.720]   That's all an excuse.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.680]   Because it says everything that you need for a life in godliness has been given to you.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.520]   Not will be given to you, but it has been given to you.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:14.400]   And the only thing that we need to do to get to Christ is true repentance.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:19.560]   Recognize our sins and repent and the doors will be open.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:24.000]   Recognize our sins and repent and the mountains will be cut down and the ravines will be
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.520]   raised up.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.560]   He says to repent.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:33.120]   You know what's interesting is whenever strong sermons are given, the people who normally
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.840]   need to hear usually gets offended.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:40.800]   And the people who I look at and say, wow, they're really doing well.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.200]   They're the ones who usually say, thank you for that sermon.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.280]   That's exactly what happens here.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.800]   John the Baptist gives and he calls them out on their sin.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.840]   And the Pharisees and the leaders are offended.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.920]   And from that moment on, they're like, that guy is a false prophet.
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.960]   They start distancing himself with them.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.760]   They didn't have to get rid of him because eventually Herod gets rid of him.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:08.720]   But Jesus comes and he takes the baton and he goes even further than John the Baptist.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.080]   And they want to make sure that this doesn't happen again.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.440]   So that's why they end up crucifying him.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.920]   Some of them are convicted to the heart.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.480]   In verse 10, it says, and the crowds were questioning him saying, then what shall we
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.640]   do?
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:27.080]   If you're calling us out and my repentance is not genuine, what shall we do?
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:31.200]   He responds in verse 11, and he would answer and say to them, the man who has two tunics
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.080]   is to share with him who has none.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.540]   And he who has food is to do likewise.
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.340]   If you look at Acts chapter 2, that's exactly what happens.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:42.040]   People who are wealthy were selling their possessions and they were passing it out.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:46.720]   And people were living together, being generous.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.440]   Now why does he point this out?
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:53.040]   I mean, Jesus himself said you can't serve two mammons.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.040]   You can't have two gods.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.740]   Either you will serve money or you will serve God.
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.740]   But you're not going to do both.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:04.920]   If after claiming to know Christ and your spending habit is no different than somebody
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:10.020]   who does not know Christ, then maybe there was a repentance externally.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:13.200]   Maybe you were baptized, but it wasn't true baptism.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.720]   There's no fruit.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.280]   Now the Bible didn't call everybody to live poor.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.160]   He didn't say you have to sell all your possessions.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.720]   And in essence, the fire actually get into trouble because of that, because they pretended.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.880]   He said that wasn't required of you.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:32.120]   But the reason why he points this out is because of that, that we can, we can sacrifice what
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   is less.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:39.920]   But he says, Jesus himself said, right, your heart is where your treasure is.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:47.640]   So he said, take your treasure and invest it in things that will last.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:56.560]   And he goes on and he says in Luke chapter 3 verse 12, and some tax collectors also came
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.280]   to be baptized and said to him, teacher, what shall we do?
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.120]   And he said to them, collect no more than what you have been ordered to.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.480]   Some soldiers were questioning him, questioning him saying, and what about us?
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.480]   What shall we do?
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.720]   And he said to them, do not take money from anyone by force or accuse anyone falsely and
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.400]   be content with your wages.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:20.560]   One thing I want to point out here is that he's referring to their jobs, right?
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.040]   Their jobs.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.120]   Because that's where they spend the most of their time.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:31.480]   You know, we kind of have a tendency to compartmentalize like we're righteous at church, but then
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.600]   that's where we turn it off, right?
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:39.440]   We're godly at church, but then at home we're a completely different person.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:44.480]   Or maybe you're good at home, but then you're lousy at work.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:50.880]   That's for some reason we compartmentalize where we bear fruit and then the other parts
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.400]   where people are not watching, it doesn't really matter.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.120]   So he goes straight to them.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:58.200]   He doesn't say, make sure you come to the temple more often.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:03.320]   He said, make sure that your sacrifices are really clean, you follow the order.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.680]   And all of that is true and is important, but he goes straight to the matter where the
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:10.500]   rubber meets the road, it's at their job.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:16.280]   Make sure that there's true fruit in what you're doing, that the world may see that
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:20.280]   there was true baptism of repentance.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.000]   Let me wrap up this morning.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.120]   You cannot have peace of God without having peace with God.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.560]   Let me say that again.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:31.560]   You cannot.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.560]   It is impossible.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:40.760]   It is unbiblical to have peace of God without peace with God.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:47.080]   How much of your frustration in your walk with God that sometimes you blame God for
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:51.280]   is because you do not have peace with God.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:46:00.500]   You want to have a relationship with God on your terms and God repeatedly tells you no.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.960]   You cannot and you will not.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.480]   You cannot come to God with unconfessed sins.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.720]   You cannot come to God when you sweep it under the rug.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:16.620]   When you can, you cannot come to God if repeatedly all you are doing is feeling bad and there's
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:22.140]   no true turning from sins internally or externally.
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:25.740]   You cannot have peace of God in your home.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:29.000]   You cannot have peace with God in your marriage.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.140]   You cannot have peace with God at church, with your relationships until there is peace
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.920]   with God.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:41.680]   And the only way that you can have peace with God is true repentance.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.080]   True repentance.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:47.360]   The good news of the gospel isn't that a holy God looked at your sin and said, "You know
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.360]   what?
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.360]   I'm not going to keep you accountable.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.360]   I'm going to die on the cross."
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:54.040]   And then from that moment on, when you confess, you don't have to worry about sin.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.360]   That's not the gospel.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:01.320]   The gospel is, the good news is that if you repent, he will forgive you.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.220]   That's the gospel.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.160]   If you repent, he will forgive you.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.840]   It's not if you feel bad, he will forgive you.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:14.800]   If you repent, he will forgive you.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:19.520]   Isaiah 29, 13, "And the Lord said, 'Because these people draw near with their words and
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:24.160]   honor me with their lip service, but they remove their hearts far from me and their
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.800]   reverence for me consists of tradition learned by rote.'"
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.720]   It just became habit.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:35.240]   Everything I know about my walk with God is just habit.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.040]   But there's no true worship happening.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:46.240]   Jesus repeats those same words, Matthew 15, 7-9, "You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.240]   of you.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:52.240]   These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts is far away from me.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:58.800]   But in vain do they worship me in teachings and doctrines, the precepts of men."
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.480]   John the Baptist's message is loud and clear.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.440]   Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:12.280]   Jesus comes on the scene, he takes the baton and he says, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.000]   is at hand."
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.800]   He gave that baton to the apostles and the apostles began to preach, "Repent for the
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.400]   kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:30.040]   And then he gave that baton to the pastors and evangelists and missionaries to say, "Repent
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.760]   for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:41.040]   Whether that is in the first century or 2,000 years later, the message has not changed.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.080]   Even if you don't hear it, even if it's not a popular message, the commission that we
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:50.760]   have been given to take to the world has not changed.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:59.560]   We can only come to Christ by the road that he has paved for us, which is repentance,
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.040]   true repentance.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:07.400]   I pray that this message will be loud and clear to all of us.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:15.480]   Yes, we wrestle, we struggle, we get tempted, we covet, but do not ever think that that
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.040]   is okay.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:26.360]   The God who is holy, holy, holy calls us to himself and because of his grace, sinners
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:32.720]   who are undeserving, when we repent, we'll find refuge in him.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.600]   But we must repent.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.360]   We must repent.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.080]   Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:46.360]   Let's pray.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:54.080]   Lord, we plead for your grace.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:50:06.120]   Lord, if we have become low to sleep in our compromise, I pray you would open our eyes.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:12.520]   As Paul's scales fell from his eyes and he repented, was never the same.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.960]   Lord, help us.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:18.840]   Lord, we believe help our unbelief.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:24.180]   Help us to see the things that we covet is leading us to destruction.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:30.680]   Help us to see and number our days that all that we rejoice over is temporary.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.880]   Lord, help us, Lord God.
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:38.640]   Lord, all the time, energy and money that we are putting in so that we can have a better
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:46.240]   retirement, help us, Lord, to see eternity, that we may invest in things, Lord God, that
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.240]   will never fade, spoil or perish.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:59.120]   Lord, as you've called people to repent, to confess our sins, to cling to our savior,
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:05.200]   that the only thing that can cleanse us from our own guilt is the blood of Christ, help
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:08.800]   us, Lord God, cling to him with all our might.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:14.520]   Lead us that we may honor you, worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
