[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12, we're going to be finishing up
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.760]   this section together.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.520]   Hebrews chapter 12 verses 25 through 29, and our focus this morning is going to be on verse
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.840]   28 and 29.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.120]   Hebrews chapter 12 verses 25 through 29, I'm going to be reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.080]   See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking, for if those did not escape when
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.960]   they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape who turn away from
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.200]   him who warns from heaven.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.880]   And his voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I will
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.160]   shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.160]   This expression, yet once more, denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.600]   as of created things, so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.000]   Therefore since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude by
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.280]   which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.280]   fire.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.280]   Let's pray.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:16.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray that your word would be open to us, speak to us, convict us, reveal
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.400]   the things in our hearts and our lives, Lord God, that we may truly be able to give you
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.720]   worship that you deserve.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.960]   May your word and your word only go forth.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.360]   As most of you guys know, yesterday we celebrated as a country the 20th year anniversary or
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.240]   remembrance of 9/11.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.600]   Some of you may remember exactly what happened that day.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.480]   Some of you may have been a bit too young for you to remember.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.400]   It's just kind of a news to you, but those of you who remember, and I remember very specifically,
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.840]   I was in my house in Corona early in the morning and I got a phone call from one of my former
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.920]   students, high school students, and she was so distraught.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.120]   And it was so strange because it was like 7 or 7/20 and she was telling me that a plane
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.240]   hit the tower and it was just confusing, we don't know what to do.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.040]   And I remember turning on the TV and the plane that hit it.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.800]   And no one knew exactly what was going on, that at the minimum it looked like a horrific
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.340]   accident.
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.920]   And then while the TV was on, we saw the second plane go into the second building and immediately
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.640]   we knew, okay, this was no accident.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.560]   This was a orchestrated attack.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.360]   And then there was news that another plane hit the Pentagon, another one was headed toward
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.880]   the White House.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.600]   And so everything got shut down.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.000]   And we remember very specifically thinking that we're at war.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.080]   We didn't know it was going to be just the planes, is there going to be an actual, you
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.440]   know, soldiers coming into the United States, is there going to be a nuclear bomb going
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.440]   off?
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.120]   And so there was a period of terror, literally, and so all the airplanes, so whoever was on
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.520]   in the sky flying, they just landed wherever they were at and then they were stranded for
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.520]   a period.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.720]   So all this security checks and stuff that we have to go through now has been implemented
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.600]   because of that.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.200]   And again, you may remember years ago, we were able to go into Canada and Mexico without
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   a passport, remember?
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.240]   We would just kind of go in with our driver's license, come back.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.840]   Then after that, they changed the law so that now we have to have a passport because they
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.600]   wanted to be a bit more careful with the border control.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.880]   That's been 20 years.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.120]   And so I remember very specifically the mantra of that time is, "We will never forget that
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.800]   we are under attack."
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.840]   And for the first time, at least in the history of the United States that I remember, again,
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.120]   you know, prior to Pearl Harbor, where American land was literally attacked, and we knew that
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.440]   there were terrorists outside of the borders of the United States, but the fact that they
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:09.800]   were able to come into this country and kill senselessly almost 3,000 people kind of gave
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.560]   it reality that if these people had their hands in a nuclear bomb, they wouldn't hesitate
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.360]   to use it.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.640]   And so that fear caused everybody in the United States to come together.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.920]   And I remember very specifically that Republicans and Democrats, at least from what I remember,
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.640]   they've never really got along, you know, but nothing like it is today.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.000]   But even back then, they were constantly bickering.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.160]   And I remember very specifically in Capitol Hill, they stood arm to arm saying that, "We're
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.760]   at war with these terrorists and that you've attacked us, so now we're going to war."
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.000]   And that's what started all this war in Afghanistan and then into Iraq and war against terrorism.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.860]   But again, I remember the very specific mantra, "We will never forget."
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.920]   I think most of us will agree that we have forgotten, right?
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.280]   It's just a memory.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.760]   And so every year when there's a commemoration, obviously it was the 20th year, so it was
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.560]   bigger than the previous years.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.360]   But the reason why I say all of this is because that particular event caused people who went
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.520]   through that and saw that, caused us to see the world differently.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.680]   That this wasn't the same United States that prior to 9/11, you know, how we felt before
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.320]   and how we felt afterwards caused us to see.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.440]   And it wasn't because evil was created by 9/11.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.360]   It just kind of reminded us there are people who are willing to do that if you give them
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.360]   an opportunity.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.120]   So we need to be constantly vigilant and be ready.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.920]   I say all of this because the Bible tells us that not just there's a physical war going
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.840]   on, he says we have an enemy who's the devil, who's like a roaring lion seeking someone
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.840]   to devour.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.840]   And Paul says in Galatians or Ephesians that we are in this spiritual battle constantly
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.960]   at war.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.660]   And the moment that we forget that and we relax, that's when we are the most vulnerable.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.600]   And we need to recognize the Bible clearly tells us that we're just passing through.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.860]   This is not permanent.
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.320]   However great, however peaceful, however great the economy may be, this is all going to pass
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.320]   one day.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.200]   And that Christ is going to come in his full glory and judgment is going to come with him
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.440]   and he's going to shake the earth and only those that remain he will be with in eternity.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.480]   I remember again back then after 9/11 a few months, maybe about six, seven months afterwards,
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:49.440]   I was on campus at UCI and I was sharing the gospel and I met this young man and I started
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.640]   to share the gospel with him.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.200]   And his immediate response, and this was a common response from a lot of non-Christians
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:01.800]   at that time, "How can I believe in your God when you say he is so loving?
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.300]   How can a loving God allow 9/11 to happen?"
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.300]   And that was his response.
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.320]   And it wasn't, he was not the only person that said that.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.720]   Anytime we would try to share the gospel that you probably have heard that too.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.200]   If your God is so loving, why would he allow so much suffering in the world?
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.000]   And at that particular time because the whole world was shaken up by what happened, how
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.840]   can God allow that?
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.840]   So I remember spending about 15 minutes trying to explain to him, the God or the gospel that
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.240]   you heard is an incomplete gospel.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.080]   In fact, the Bible does not start out by telling us how much he loves us.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:42.320]   The Bible actually starts out by telling us how angry he is with the sinful world.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.400]   He says, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.120]   Wrath of God is being revealed against all unrighteousness."
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.240]   And as a result of that, if we die in our natural state that we're going to meet this
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.760]   holy God, then there's eternal judgment waiting.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:00.880]   And so however tragic that may be or even more tragic things that you may have seen,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.320]   the Bible says that's just a glimpse of what it means to live in this fallen world.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.900]   And the judgment that's coming is going to be far more terrifying than anything that
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.280]   you have possibly imagined in human history.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.440]   The Bible tells us that that's the state that mankind is in.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.520]   But the gospel comes in, the good news is that despite that, that God sent his only
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:28.740]   begotten son and absorbed the wrath that you and I deserved upon the body of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:34.520]   And he offers us that if we confess our sins, that he is faithful and just to forgive us
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.200]   of all our unrighteousness, that he will absorb that sin and give us eternal life and make
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.960]   us his adopted children.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.920]   But when we understand the grace of God outside of the context of God's wrath, that question
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.240]   is the logical question that will come up.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.880]   If he loves us so much, why did he create hell?
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.440]   If he loves us so much, why does 9/11 happen?
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.220]   If he loves us so much, why are there so many people suffering?
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.240]   Why are there sex trafficking?
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.880]   If he loves us so much.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:12.520]   We have preached the gospel in fear of how people would respond and as a result of that
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:19.940]   watered down the message of the cross to the point where it no longer makes logical sense.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.360]   And in the church we repeat it to each other so many times and it makes sense to us, but
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.360]   as soon as we go out on the street, we start challenging people and they start pushing
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.360]   back.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.880]   We say, "Oh yeah, I never thought about that."
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.640]   But the problem is the majority of the people in the church never engage in the non-Christian
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:41.600]   world so you don't know what kind of holes you have in your logic.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:49.920]   God is not universally, unconditionally satisfied with mankind.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.120]   If we don't understand this, the gospel itself does not make sense.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.820]   That's why even in the text that we're looking at, after explaining the grace of God to us,
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.080]   that we're not going to Mount Sinai, but we're headed to Mount Zion where there's a celebration
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:08.440]   of angels and multitudes gathered together to worship him, he concludes that section
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.500]   by saying, "Do not refuse him."
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:21.180]   If those who refused him, who spoke from earth, had serious consequences, how much more if
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.420]   you refuse him who's speaking from heaven, who will shake not only the earth, but the
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:31.300]   heavens itself, that he will come and he will shake all things and bring judgment, how much
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:37.220]   more if we refuse him and just kind of nonchalantly continue to neglect and to just drift away
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.420]   from him?
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:45.980]   So the proper response to grace that we were looking at is that we do not refuse him.
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.820]   We take his word seriously.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.340]   We understand the grace that we have in Christ.
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.280]   And secondly, that we live for things that are not shakable.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:02.900]   And then thirdly, the proper response to this grace is gratitude.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.340]   In verse 28, it says, "Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken,
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.820]   let us show gratitude."
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.020]   The proper response is gratitude.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.040]   So what I want to look at this morning is in this text, it says, "What is the gratitude
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.620]   of Christians based on?"
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:24.380]   It says clearly here, "Christian gratitude is not based on circumstance.
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.500]   It's not based upon material blessings that come and go.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.420]   It's not based upon good health.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.860]   It's not based upon a good relationship, your business doing well."
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:44.180]   See, the world knows how to be gracious and to have thanksgiving.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.260]   And so usually during thanksgiving, when you say, "Well, what are you thankful for?"
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260]   "Oh, I'm thankful for this new house that we bought.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.740]   I thank you for my children who just got all As.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.220]   I thank you for this stock that I invested in.
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.100]   It just went through the roof.
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:04.060]   I thank you for God answering my prayer who, you know, my brother, sister, mother, dad
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.420]   who was sick and they're not sick anymore."
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:12.220]   And so if we're not careful, our attitude of gratitude is no different than the rest
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.700]   of the world.
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:22.220]   But he said, "Christian gratitude is based upon receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken."
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.540]   Eternal things, not things that come and go.
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.220]   For one period it's true and one period it's not.
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:32.340]   He said, "Our gratitude is based upon a kingdom that cannot be shaken."
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:38.300]   Daniel 2, 244, it says, "In the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.380]   which will never be destroyed.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.860]   And that kingdom will not be left for another people.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:51.340]   It will crush and put an end of all these kingdoms, but it will itself endure forever."
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:57.180]   How much confidence do we put in the United States, in any kingdom?
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.100]   Maybe our family, our bank account.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:04.220]   No, Christian gratitude is based upon things that are eternal, His kingdom.
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.980]   Hebrews 1, 8 it says, "But of the Son, He says, 'Your throne, O God, is forever and
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.420]   ever, and the righteous scepter is of His kingdom.'"
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:16.900]   I mean, right now there's just so much uncertainty.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.060]   Is the housing market going to crash or not?
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.060]   How about the economy?
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.860]   The inflation is through the roof.
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.380]   How can the stock market keep going up the way it is right now?
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.260]   So everybody's predicting maybe the economy's going to crash.
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.380]   Are the Republicans and Democrats ever going to be able to come together?
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:39.220]   I mean, the chasm between the two, it seems so far out that the logical conclusion to
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.380]   this seems like some kind of a divorce.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:51.100]   So is the United States going to be able to come together at some point?
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.820]   There's a lot of things that are more personal to you, your family, your health, your school,
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.260]   this pandemic.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.340]   And so many things that are uncertain.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:09.700]   And our emotion, if our hope is attached to these things, will go up and down, up and
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:15.300]   down based upon the local news, based upon your stock market, based upon your health
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.780]   and how your children are doing.
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:29.540]   But he says here, the natural response, the correct response to God's grace is gratitude.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.980]   In Isaiah 40, 28-31, it says, "Do you not know, have you not heard?
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.820]   The everlasting God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, does not become
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.780]   weary or tired.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.860]   His understanding is inscrutable.
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:46.500]   He gives strength to the weary, and to him who lacks might, he increases power.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.700]   Though youth grow weary and tired, and vigorous young men stumble badly, yet those who wait
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.660]   for the Lord will gain new strength."
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.340]   What does it mean to wait for the Lord?
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.340]   Just sit and do nothing?
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.860]   Does it mean wait for the Lord?
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.180]   It's like, don't do anything, don't move, don't say anything, just stay still.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:09.660]   Well, the wait for the Lord here is related to the term in John chapter 15 when it says,
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:15.100]   if you want to bear fruit, to remain in me, to be connected to him, to rely on him, to
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.100]   continue with him.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:24.380]   So to wait upon the Lord basically means to not to anchor yourself to anything else other
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.300]   than God and his promises.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:33.500]   And those who have anchored their faith, anchored their life, anchored their joy in God, he
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.180]   says, they will renew their strength.
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.140]   They will mount up with wings like eagles.
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.660]   They will run and not get tired.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:45.300]   They will walk and not become weary.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.420]   When you read the prophecies of the Old Testament and the New Testament, they are not simple
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.540]   predictions.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.660]   They're not predictions.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:00.460]   God is not in his omniscience, looked way down in history and he saw the unfolding of
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.140]   human history and he just wrote it down and said, "Hey, this is what's going to happen."
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.380]   That's not prophecy.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:11.340]   That's the way you and I may naturally think, but prophecy in the Bible is basically God
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:16.620]   telling us what he's going to do.
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:23.340]   You see, if you've been in the political circle for any period, you probably lost confidence.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:29.500]   Those of you who are new to voting and following politics and next politician comes up and
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.860]   says, "I'm going to change the world.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.860]   You don't have money.
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.420]   I'll give it to you.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.560]   Your business isn't working.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.980]   It's because of this guy, but when I come in, it's going to change.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.940]   Our lifespan is going to be longer.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.340]   All the other countries are going to respect us.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.060]   We're going to defeat all the other."
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.940]   They make promises like they're Jesus himself, but if you've been in the political circle
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:57.820]   long enough, they say all of these things and some of them may be very sincere, but
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:03.840]   once they get in to the office, every single one of them realize just how daunting this
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.820]   task is.
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.660]   They realize that they don't have as much control as they thought.
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:14.620]   The problem seems always simple until you actually try to deal with it.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.900]   I want you guys to remember that.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.380]   This is kind of a side point.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:24.020]   If you have a lot of opinions on things that you haven't ever really done yourself, I would
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:31.540]   say be humble because every politician that before they go into office, somebody's like,
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.280]   "Just do this, one, two, three, and four, and everything will be great."
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.040]   But I think once they go in, they realize it's not as simple as they thought.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.480]   The government is way more dysfunctional than they could possibly imagine.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:48.880]   You have two groups in power who is actively trying to destroy one another and they say,
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.120]   "I'm not going to deal with that.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.680]   I'm going to be true to it," but it's harder than they think.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:00.720]   They get in there and their human nature steps in and they're afraid that if they say the
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.360]   wrong thing or not do the right thing, then they're not going to be elected for the next
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.280]   time that election comes.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.720]   They work very, very hard to politically stay safe so that they can get elected the next
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.720]   time and that's the problem.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.920]   Whatever the reason is, whether they deliberately lied or whether they had good intention, once
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:27.240]   they get into power, they realize that they don't have a lot of control, even over themselves.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:34.000]   I can tell you that next Sunday I'll see you and I guarantee I'm going to be here.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.120]   Now I may fully mean it, but I can't guarantee you because I may get in a car accident today.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.600]   I may have a heart attack.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.280]   I may just change my mind.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.280]   I'm not sure.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.560]   I'm determined today, but tomorrow I wake up and say, "Ah, forget it.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.720]   I don't want to do this anymore."
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:03.840]   Anything that is created, anything that man promises is not on solid ground.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.440]   That's why in the book of Titus, the text that we're studying together, it says in verse
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.840]   1 and 2, "Paul, a bondservant of God, apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.520]   of God and knowledge of the truth which is according to Godliness in hope of eternal
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:22.080]   life which God who cannot lie promised long ages ago."
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:29.960]   That this salvation was given to us by an almighty, omniscient, omnipotent God who cannot
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.960]   lie.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.680]   Why is he saying that?
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:37.680]   He's telling us you can bank on it.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.280]   That his promises were not just predictions.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.080]   They're not wishful thoughts.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.800]   He's telling us this is going to happen.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.920]   So if you believe that, anchor yourself to that.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.640]   If you don't believe it, obviously you're not going to anchor yourself.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.680]   And that's what separates believers and unbelievers.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.120]   True believers versus posers.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:05.800]   You can say it, but your life and joy and hope is not really anchored in that.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.920]   Hebrews chapter 6, 17, and 19, it says, "In the same way, God desiring even more to show
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:16.640]   the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose interposed with an oath, so
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.760]   that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie."
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.000]   Two things.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.760]   His purpose and what he says cannot be changed because God cannot lie.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.680]   We who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope that's
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.480]   set before us.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:41.200]   Hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast, and one which enters
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.280]   within the veil.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.840]   Christian gratitude is anchored in this hope.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.360]   Our Thanksgiving isn't something that we try to look up every Thanksgiving time, like,
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.760]   "Oh, what am I thankful for?
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.480]   I'm thankful for my children, I'm thankful for this weather, I'm thankful for our leadership,
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.080]   I'm thankful for the church."
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:07.120]   And we're thankful for all these things that if we're not careful are just temporary.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:16.320]   Ultimately, the core, the foundation of Christian gratitude is God and his kingdom that is unshakable.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.880]   It will not change, even if the economy crashes.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.680]   Maybe you just bought a house and the housing market tanks.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.120]   Maybe you bought cryptocurrency and it goes to zero.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:33.440]   Maybe you've been putting money into your retirement and the stock market just tanks.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:38.520]   Maybe the US government, because communism is rising, is no longer going to be the superpower
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.760]   and communism begins to come in.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.840]   God forbid.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:50.480]   But even if our worst nightmares happen, our anchor is secure in Christ.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.080]   Our gratitude cannot be shaken.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:22:01.480]   See, in Luke chapter 10, 17 to 20, Jesus sends out the 70 disciples, two by two.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.720]   They come back skipping and rejoicing.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.200]   It says, "The 70 return with joy, saying, 'Lord, even the demons are subject to us
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.200]   in your name.'"
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.280]   I mean, imagine that, okay?
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.040]   So put yourself in their shoes.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.840]   These are just commoners, fishermen, they weren't people of prominence.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:28.920]   So the first time they were practically experiencing spiritual power, demons were shaking at their
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.840]   presence when they were praying.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.360]   "Lord, even the demons are subject to your name."
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.040]   And Jesus said to them, "I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.360]   Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.880]   powers of the enemy, and nothing will injure you."
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   Imagine that excitement.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.920]   Imagine if you came to Jesus excited about casting out demons and he says, "Scorpions,"
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.600]   like all the stuff, the satanic things that he's going to throw at you, "I've given you
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.760]   authority to overpower them."
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.520]   Can you imagine that?
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:08.280]   If Jesus said that to me, I would be walking through scorpions just to test this out.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.280]   It's like, "Fight me."
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.280]   It's like, "Oh, look at that."
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:20.520]   But he says, "Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you,
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.620]   but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven."
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:31.600]   As exciting as that may be, it is temporary.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.600]   It is temporary.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:38.520]   God was, Jesus was trying to train them to rely on him, but the rejoicing should not
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:44.680]   be in the fruits of your ministry because they come and they go.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.560]   Just like money, they come, they go.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.320]   Security comes and it goes.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.560]   Relationship will come and it goes.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:58.200]   Whatever that is here, once God shakes things, nothing is permanent.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.520]   And you know, if you've lived any period of time, when you're young, anything good, you
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.820]   feel like you're going to have it forever.
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:04.820]   You live a little.
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.520]   There's a reason why older people are more jaded, right?
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.420]   Because they've known your joy at one point.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:18.980]   And so older people are filled with disappointments.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.180]   So you don't see young people who are grizzled.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.460]   It's usually old men who are grizzled.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:32.220]   You ever see, this is just off tangent for a little bit.
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.060]   There's reasons why your parents don't have a lot of friends.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:42.420]   They had a lot of friends when they were young, just like you.
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:49.140]   They had freshmen gatherings, sophomore, sister appreciation nights, brother appreciation.
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.020]   They all just like you.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.260]   And they were hurt.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.580]   Somebody disappointed them.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.460]   Somebody moved away from them.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.700]   Their heart was broken.
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:05.660]   The job that they were promised wasn't given to them.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.100]   The government disappointed them.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.740]   And so year after year after year of disappointment, after disappointment, after disappointment,
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.620]   and then one day you wake up, it's like, I don't trust anybody.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:21.580]   And if we're not careful, even when somebody comes to Christ, it's like, well, let's see.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.740]   Let's see how long this lasts.
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:29.260]   That's years and years of disappointment from this world, from people, from economy, from
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.660]   politicians.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:38.460]   And he said, that's true because the Bible says don't rejoice over that.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:43.980]   Because when it gets shaken, all of it will remind you it's temporary.
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.540]   The reason why we get grizzled is because we place our confidence in things that we
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.700]   shouldn't have put confidence in.
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:56.420]   He said, rejoice, if you're going to rejoice that your name is recorded in heaven.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:01.380]   C.S. Lewis in his book Weight of Glory says, "If we consider the unblushing promises of
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.260]   reward and the staggering nature of rewards promised in the Gospels, it would seem that
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:09.520]   our Lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.460]   We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.620]   joy is offered to us.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:21.620]   Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:27.260]   imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at sea, we are far too easily pleased."
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:35.120]   Let me ask you a tangible question.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:41.940]   If the proper response to grace is gratitude because we are receiving a kingdom that cannot
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:53.940]   be shaken, how much of our rejoicing in Christ comes anywhere close to when your sports team
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:58.220]   wins a championship?
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.020]   Is it even close?
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.620]   Is it even a tenth of that?
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:14.420]   Because winning a championship in your favorite sports team is the mud pie.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.500]   Is the mud pie.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.380]   It's a game.
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.780]   You're not any richer for that.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.460]   Your life doesn't change for that.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.160]   Your children aren't better because of that.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.220]   But it's just, it's not wrong, it's not sinful.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.380]   Just mud pie.
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:35.900]   In relation to our worship before God, when we think of what he has given us, what has
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:45.180]   been sacrificed in order for you and I to be here to worship him, does it even compare?
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.000]   In Psalm 1611 it says, "You will make known to me the path of life.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.520]   In your presence is fullness of joy.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.540]   In your right hand there are pleasures forever."
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:01.580]   If you believe that statement, you will anchor yourself to the statement and live and invest
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.400]   based upon this promise.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:10.060]   Because ultimately the greatest satisfaction, the greatest refuge is found in the unshakable
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.060]   promise of Christ.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:17.500]   Because the king is unshakable, so therefore the kingdom is unshakable.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.260]   That's the basis of Christian gratitude.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.780]   Not because my friends love me, not because I have better health, not because economy
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:31.220]   is doing better, not because the right person is in leadership, but because I have a king
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:37.680]   whose rules over a kingdom that cannot be shaken.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.180]   If we understand that, if we embrace that, he said, "Well, what does this gratitude
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.180]   lead to?"
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:46.020]   Well, he says, "Therefore since we receive the kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:51.820]   show gratitude by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe,
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.780]   for our God is a consuming fire."
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:59.660]   The grounds in which we have gratitude is an unshakable kingdom.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:05.680]   But once we have gratitude, he says, "It leads to by which we offer to God an acceptable
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.300]   service."
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:11.600]   The word for service here is the word "Liturgo."
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.380]   So if you've been here for a while, you know that I've given this message probably
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.740]   about two or three times in the church.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:22.620]   The most prominent word for worship in the Greek is "proskeneo."
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.380]   Proskeneo basically means to be prostrated.
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:30.860]   It's kind of a scene of somebody bowing down and kissing the feet of the king because you're
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.100]   in awe of something greater than you.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.500]   And that's the most of the times when you see the word worship in the New Testament,
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.780]   it's that word proskeneo, prostrated, surrendered, right?
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:45.700]   It's just you are beyond what I can imagine, and that's proskeneo.
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.420]   The second word is the word "sabomai."
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:53.260]   Sabomai basically means to have reverence, internal reverence and awe toward God, right?
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:58.180]   So when the Bible says, "Render more than your garments, but your very hearts," that's
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:03.780]   what he's referring to, that proper adoration ought to be more than just external service.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:08.780]   The word here, "Liturgo," has an idea of the actual service.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:14.360]   In the Old Testament, in the Septuagint, the word that was used here to describe the service
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.260]   at the temple by the priest was the word "liturgo."
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:24.340]   In the New Testament, that word is described as our Christian living, as an act of worship,
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.840]   and that's what's described in Romans 12, verse 1.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.620]   That same word was used here, and it says, "Therefore, I urge you, brethren, by the mercies
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:36.340]   of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:41.540]   your spiritual service of worship, liturgo."
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:53.860]   So if gratitude is what leads to acceptable service, ingratitude is what leads to unacceptable
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.380]   service.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.120]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:04.020]   So at the core of everything that we do, if it is not an overflow of appreciation of what
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:09.740]   God has done, so therefore, I volunteer to give worship through this way.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.660]   And if you're doing this, "Oh, I got to do this?
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.860]   I got to do that?"
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.820]   That's not worship.
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:17.820]   That's not worship.
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:24.920]   You know, I've been in Bible studies where, I mean, I probably had -- I remember one time
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.780]   I was in Bible study in Garden Grove, and I went to somebody's apartment, and I could
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:36.300]   tell not a single person there wanted to be in the Bible study.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.420]   None of you were there, so don't worry, okay?
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.420]   And I could tell as soon as I walked in.
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.580]   They wanted to get that over with.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.180]   Even before we started, get it over with because they had plans to do something.
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.180]   They wanted to have a game night.
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.680]   They wanted to do this and that.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:56.980]   And so I'm like opening up the Bible study, and like right off the bat, I'm like, "Oh,
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:57.980]   my gosh.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.100]   This next hour and a half is going to be torturous."
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.340]   Sure enough, right off the bat, just a glazed look.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.140]   And if I said anything that looked -- sounded like I was going to go a little bit longer
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:13.060]   than -- you know, it's almost like anger in their eyes.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.980]   I could have literally just mumbled for the next 30 minutes, and it would have made a
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.020]   difference just as long as it was short.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.700]   And it was just torture, torture for them, torture for me.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.340]   I've given sermons like that at churches where people are flipping through magazines while
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.340]   I was preaching, you know.
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:34.020]   And usually I would try to mix up the sermon and try to get their attention, but I just
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.020]   had no desire.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.980]   I made it harder and more boring.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.980]   You don't care anyway.
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:48.180]   Yeah, I got to fix that.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:54.380]   But there's the difference between a worship that is given out of gratitude versus something
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.940]   that you're like, "You better do it.
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.940]   You want to be a member?
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.020]   You better do it.
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.020]   You want to serve?
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.020]   You better do it."
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:08.940]   So he says, "It is by this gratitude, recognizing what it is that we have in Christ, is what
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:14.860]   leads to acceptable worship."
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:20.540]   That's why what God wants is a cheerful giver, not just a giver, not just the amount, a cheerful
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:24.340]   giver, because he wants an act of worship.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:28.900]   In Psalm 104 to 5, "As I enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise, give
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.220]   thanks and bless his name, for the Lord is good.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:36.380]   His loving kindness is everlasting and his faithfulness to all generations."
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.380]   You know what's interesting?
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:45.180]   In Luke chapter 17, 17 to 19, that's the story that Jesus gives about he meets 10 lepers,
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:49.620]   and then he tells the 10 that they're begging, "Lord, please, please heal us, heal us."
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.380]   And Jesus says, "Go, show yourself to the priests at the temple."
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:58.180]   So if you remember the book of Leviticus, it says that in order for the lepers to enter
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:03.620]   back into society, the lepers had to be examined by the priests, and the priests have to give
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:08.140]   a stamp of approval saying that, "Okay, the healing has taken place."
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:13.780]   And once they are approved by the priests, then they're able to come back into worship
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.420]   and into regular society.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:20.100]   Jesus says to the 10 lepers, "Go and show yourself to the priests," and on their way,
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.340]   they all receive healing.
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.180]   Nine of them continue to go, and they just disappear.
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:29.500]   One of them, if you remember, he comes back, and he thanks Jesus.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.940]   But here's the interesting thing about this.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:36.740]   If you look at verse 17, it says, "Jesus answered and said, 'Were there not 10 cleansed, but
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.820]   the nine, where are they?
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:43.260]   Was no one found to return to give glory to God except the foreigner?'
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:49.220]   And he said to him, 'Stand up and go; your faith has made you well.'"
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.500]   All 10 of them were made well.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.660]   Why does he say to just that one that returned?
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:56.660]   What about them?
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:01.440]   Clearly, he's not talking about just his physical healing.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:09.340]   His gratitude that he returned back to give God the glory was evidence of true healing.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.700]   That's what he means here.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:16.980]   Gratitude is the proper response in which we give acceptable worship.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.380]   Isn't that exactly what it says in John 4:23?
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.580]   "An hour is coming, and now is when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:24.580]   and truth.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.440]   For such people, the Father seeks to be his worshippers.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.700]   God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.620]   God is not looking for the smartest people.
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.040]   He's not looking for the most disciplined.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.580]   He's not looking for the most gifted.
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:43.580]   He's not looking for the hardest worker or the most experienced.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:50.380]   He's looking for true worshippers, people who recognize what they have in Christ, people
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:54.960]   who've seen and experienced the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:00.540]   And so all that they do is a response to that.
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.900]   He's not looking for the smartest people.
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.740]   In fact, remember the Corinthians?
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.620]   They're all trying to be one up each other.
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:06.620]   Oh, Peter.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.100]   Apollos is the smart one.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.380]   Paul is the hard worker.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.940]   Peter was the first leader.
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.300]   Remember how Paul addresses them?
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.940]   Not many of you were smart.
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.540]   In fact, God chose you because you were dumb.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:22.300]   That's kind of humbling, right?
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.020]   And that's the modern translation.
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:25.020]   That's basically what he was saying.
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.440]   You guys are all trying to one up each other, trying to be so smart.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.660]   You were chosen because you were dumb.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:33.380]   You're trying to be somebody in the church.
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.020]   God chose you because you were nobody.
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.020]   You forgot that?
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:41.620]   And you're trying to be somebody in the church, and that's what's causing all this division.
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:46.380]   Remember, stay dumb for Christ.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.380]   That's modern translation, right?
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:53.300]   God's not looking for the smartest.
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.340]   Not to say you can't be smart.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:58.260]   Not to say you shouldn't work hard.
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:05.180]   But the primary thing that he's looking for are people who have been affected by this grace.
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.060]   And you respond by gratitude.
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:15.860]   And by this gratitude, you serve him and you worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:23.220]   But the greatest struggle that you and I have is the constant, constant distraction from
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.620]   this world.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:30.100]   John Piper in his book, Hunger for God, we read that as a church.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:36.460]   He says this, "The greatest enemy of hunger for God is not poison, but apple pie.
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:40.260]   Is not the banquet of the wicked that dulls our appetite for heaven, but endless nibbling
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.500]   at the table of the world.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:47.620]   It is not the X-rated video, but the prime time drivel of triviality we drink in every
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.140]   night."
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:58.460]   There's a constant distraction that makes the things that are glorious just mundane.
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.820]   A habit.
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.580]   Why did we come here this morning?
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.700]   Because it's Sunday.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.700]   That's what we do.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.100]   That's what we've been doing.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.100]   What are you doing Wednesday?
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.100]   It's Wednesday.
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:13.100]   It's Bible study time.
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.260]   That's what we do.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:19.000]   The word holy literally means to be set apart.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.020]   When we typically think of holy, we think morally holy.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.900]   But the word in itself simply means to be set apart.
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:30.540]   That's why in the Old Testament, God would take a bowl and dedicate it to the temple
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.580]   and it became holy.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:36.340]   A bowl became holy because it was set apart from that which was common.
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:41.180]   You would take an animal, it was like just hanging around with all the other animals,
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:46.380]   and all of a sudden you set it apart as a sacrifice to God and then it became holy.
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:51.280]   So no one was able to touch that because once it was set apart, it belonged to God.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.280]   It's no longer common.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:56.740]   So that's what the word holy means.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:04.340]   So everything that we do that just becomes a habit is no longer holy.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:09.600]   It's just common because it's just habitual.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.520]   Worship is not something that we give because you showed up.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.880]   Worship is something that we give because we've been affected by His glory.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:23.000]   Glory, the word in and of itself, means weighty.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.960]   That's what the word literally means.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:31.120]   That when we beheld His glory, we saw something that was very serious.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:35.080]   It was something very weighty.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:43.480]   So the word holy and the word glory, the word in and of itself, causes us to be set apart
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:49.600]   from everything that is common, everything that is habitual.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.760]   I mentioned this to you before.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.240]   I don't like wearing suits.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:00.260]   In fact, I have friends who think I'm weird for wearing suits.
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.400]   I don't like wearing suits.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.400]   They say, "Just take it off.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.320]   Don't be so legalistic."
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:12.360]   If you've ever met me during the weekday, nine out of ten times I have a black t-shirt
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:17.160]   on with a jean or a gray one.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:22.800]   I have about 15 of those.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.120]   To me, it's just a waste of time to think about what I'm going to put on.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.640]   So it's the easiest thing to do.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:31.520]   So even on Sunday when I put suits on, the only thing that enters my mind is, "What
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.920]   didn't I not wear last week?"
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:37.440]   That's the only thought that enters my mind when I choose which suit to wear.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.000]   Why do I wear it?
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.320]   I've had somebody tell me, "Hey man, calm down.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.320]   This is California.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.320]   Hang loose, buddy."
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:52.520]   Because I don't want Sunday to be common.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:57.400]   I don't want the handling of the Word of God to be common.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:03.360]   I don't want our corporate worship to be no different than when we went to watch a
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.540]   movie at AMC.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.600]   It should be different.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.820]   It should be set apart.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.280]   We shouldn't walk in here like you walk into any assembly.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.960]   This is not just any assembly.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:22.160]   This is a gathering of the ones who have been set apart to worship a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.280]   It should not be common.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.640]   It should not be pedestrian.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:33.260]   And so when we recognize who it is that we worship and His glory affects us and it causes
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:42.840]   us to be grateful and this gratefulness causes me to pursue sanctification, pursue love,
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.960]   that's what the Bible says that He is doing.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:51.400]   He is actively looking for people who will worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.680]   That's what He's looking for.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.280]   But here's something weird.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:02.440]   He said, "Okay, His grace affects us in this way."
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:06.880]   But then here He ends it with, "To give an acceptable service with reverence and awe
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.120]   for our God is a consuming fire."
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:16.000]   That's a weird way to end the response to grace.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Consuming fire.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Is He talking about like a campfire?
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.120]   At least very soothing?
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.160]   Enjoy His fire.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.920]   Get your marshmallow ready.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.200]   Because we worship in gratitude because He's given us grace in His unshakable kingdom because
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:37.840]   our God is a campfire.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.440]   That's not what it means.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:46.080]   He said we ought to give God our gratitude, acceptable worship because of His grace, because
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.560]   our God is a consuming fire.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:53.840]   Consuming fire in the Bible refers to His judgment, His holiness.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.240]   And almost like, huh, that's a weird way to end that.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:03.280]   If your understanding of grace of God was outside of the understanding of the wrath
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.920]   and the holiness of God, then the natural question that you probably is asking, why
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.840]   does a loving God do all of this?
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.400]   Just like that non-Christian.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:17.720]   Why would a loving God cause us to say He's a consuming fire at the end of telling us
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.920]   how gracious He is?
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:27.600]   See, His grace and His love must be understood in the context of His wrath and His judgment
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:32.520]   or else His grace is just cheap grace.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.520]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:39.080]   In Philippians 2, 9, 13, it says, "For this reason, after Jesus has humbled Himself and
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:44.200]   was crucified on the cross, for this reason also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:48.080]   Him the name which is above every name so that at the name of Jesus every knee will
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.840]   bow of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth and that every tongue
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:58.160]   will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:05.000]   So then, so then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.040]   only, but much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:17.240]   For it is God who works in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure."
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:25.520]   I don't know how many conversations I've had with people who said, "That cannot mean this."
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.520]   Because it doesn't fit the gospel that they've embraced.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.920]   It doesn't fit the idea that they've created in their own head about who God is.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:36.540]   Why would He tell New Testament, New Covenant people who have been washed in the blood of
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:41.920]   Christ to work out your salvation in fear and trembling?
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:48.360]   Possibly, the gospel that you have heard was not complete.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:55.200]   Possibly, the idea that you have of God wasn't complete.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:01.640]   The grace of God has to be understood in the consuming fire of God.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.720]   And that's why He says, "Considering this grace, do not refuse Him who is speaking from
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:14.040]   heaven because as He shakes the earth and the heavens," and we recognize that at the
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:21.320]   end of this, we have been given a kingdom that cannot be shaken, that by it we give
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:31.800]   Him gratitude, which is the basis of acceptable worship in spirit of awe and reverence because
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:36.600]   our God is a consuming fire.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:43.160]   Do not take the grace of God for granted or else you will turn the grace of God into cheap
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.800]   grace and nothing more.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.200]   Amen?
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:52.760]   Let's pray.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:46:02.360]   Again, as our worship team comes, let's take some time to seek the Lord.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:12.240]   If we have made the things of God common, our walk with God habitual, if the mud pies
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:19.880]   in our life bring more satisfaction than the glory of God, let's take some time to pray
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.040]   and ask the Lord, "Lord, search me and know me.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.080]   See if there's any hurtful ways in me.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:29.200]   I want to worship you in spirit and in truth," and ask the Lord's help to remain in it.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.640]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
