[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160]   Hi, my name is Kaylee Fong, and this is one of many stories of how God saved a broken,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.080]   wretched, depraved sinner.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.760]   By God's grace, I was born into a Christian household with parents who loved the Lord
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.520]   and sought to raise me and my siblings under the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.840]   When I was around five years old, I remember praying the prayer with my parents, asking
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.120]   Jesus to come into my life, but not truly having a heart of repentance nor a true understanding
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.960]   of what it actually meant to accept Christ into my life as Lord and Savior.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.280]   Because of this "salvation" that I had, I viewed myself as a Christian, whether it was
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.080]   doing my best to be a morally good person or going to church every Sunday.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.000]   However, while I didn't question God nor the validity of the Word, I lacked a renewed heart,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.880]   mind, and ultimately a personal relationship with God.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.440]   My hardened heart recognized the gospel as something meant for new believers or converts,
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.840]   thinking I could be saved while continuing to live any way I wanted and not understanding
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.040]   how the gospel is at the very center of true faith.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.640]   I was still dead in my sins, blind to the varied things that separated me from God and
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.160]   lacking the righteous fear of God.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.040]   To sum it all up, my attachment to the world was apparent with the pursuits of my heart.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.000]   By God's grace and love, He disciplined me in my sophomore year of high school through
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.360]   my relationships with some of my friends at the time.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.320]   During this period of my life, God revealed my sins to me.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.720]   Especially during the beginning of these problems, I sought comfort in my non-Christian peers,
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.700]   seeking those who would agree with the justification of my own sinfulness, playing victim when
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.820]   I was the perpetrator not only against my friends that I hurt, but against God.
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.200]   These actions led me down a bad path with gossip fueling the flame.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.560]   Looking back, I think that this was the first time I hated myself and my sins and had a
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.200]   desire to turn from them.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   My life at this time was filled with the desire to satisfy my own flesh, to be accepted and
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.940]   liked by my peers, and even clear my name at the extent of tainting the reputations
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.700]   of others.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.440]   I will forever be thankful to God for this child and His faithfulness throughout it,
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.800]   guiding me with a loving family who prayed for me, encouraged me, and pointed me to scripture,
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.760]   even rebuking me in my wrongdoings.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.440]   As the problems came to a close, while relationships were lost, God continued to lead me closer
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440]   to Him.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.080]   Later that year, when my older sister Sarah came back home for the summer after her first
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.920]   year of college, I saw the change in her heart and her desire to follow Christ's example.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.960]   She led Bible study sessions with me and my younger sister, challenging us to dive deeper
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.080]   into the Word and to truly apply God's Word into our own lives.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.080]   In these moments, God softened and renewed my heart, and I truly desired to know God
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.440]   in the way that my sister knew Him.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.780]   I can say with confidence that I was truly saved and regenerated with a new life in the
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.680]   Holy Spirit around this time of my life.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.780]   It was also during the summer that I began to be in the Word daily up to this day.
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.460]   With this, I know that it was only truly God who gave me this desire and hunger for the
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.340]   Word, and that it is only by Christ's death and resurrection on the cross for my sins
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.680]   that I am able to have this relationship with God.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.300]   God has given me so precious a salvation and new life, allowing me to see and experience
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.060]   true peace, joy, love, along with many other blessings.
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.540]   After being saved for these past few years, God has continually reminded me to surrender
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.980]   myself to Him and to live my life according to His will instead of my own.
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.180]   Despite COVID times being difficult, God has provided so much fruit in my life through
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.280]   the time I was being discipled by an older sister in Christ, my transition into college,
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.140]   and my search for a church where I can grow alongside other believers.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.340]   God has provided me with a greater boldness, courage, and openness than I have ever experienced,
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.860]   showing me that I should not be afraid to share the precious gift of faith that I have
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.900]   been given with others, and has taught me to let go of the struggles I face by lifting
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.100]   them up to Him who is able to conquer all things.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.140]   It still amazes me to this day why God chose to save me, or why He loves me, a sinner who
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.820]   has fallen so short of His glory.
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.780]   One passage that I really love is Romans 38-39.
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.180]   It says, "For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.260]   present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.100]   creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.300]   While I cannot fathom the true depths of our Creator's love, I can know with full assurance
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.380]   that no matter what may come in this life on earth, I can place my hope fully on the
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.140]   living hope, Jesus Christ, who I have died with to sin and have risen with in new life.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.980]   All I can say is thank you, Jesus, for saving me.
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.220]   Thank you.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.620]   [APPLAUSE]
