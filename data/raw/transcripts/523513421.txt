[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.120]   Hi, my name is Priscilla Chen and I'm a freshman in the college ministry and today I'll be
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.680]   sharing my testimony with you all.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.480]   Before attending Berean, starting in high school, I grew up in another church that was
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.040]   really like a second home to me.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.280]   I knew all the other kids and their families.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.320]   My parents were both leaders in the church and my siblings and I were very involved in
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.320]   church activities.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.360]   I was convinced that my Christian-like deeds and shallow knowledge of God and the Bible
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.680]   were enough to prove that I was a Christian and in 2017 I got baptized.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.680]   A month after I was baptized, our youth pastor passed away unexpectedly at a young age and
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.800]   it shook the youth ministry and church as a whole.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.920]   What a fragile illusion of faith I had was completely shattered as I turned in anger
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.960]   towards God, questioning why he had cut short the life of a man so dedicated to the church
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.400]   and his ministry.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.960]   I soon began to doubt the existence of God altogether, refusing to believe that this
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.440]   could be part of the plan of a God who truly loved his people.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.060]   As I dwelt on past memories, I was consumed by overwhelming guilt about the reflection
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.720]   of Christ's love my pastor had shown to me all those years that I had taken for granted
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080]   and casually dismissed.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.920]   Guilt coupled with my growing unbelief quickly drove me away from the church and Christianity
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.160]   as I tried to run as far away from God as I could.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.320]   I got a job and began to hang out with bad friends who introduced me to all the evil
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.760]   things this world has to offer.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.680]   For every empty void that I felt in my life, I found a sin to indulge in, to find temporary
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.680]   satisfaction and self-worth.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.480]   In a worldly sense, I never felt more free.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.840]   I had the means to buy and do the things I wanted and friends to reassure me that this
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.400]   was right and that I was happy.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.040]   During the summer after my sophomore year of high school, my sister sat down to talk
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.880]   with me about the concerns my parents had voiced about my rebellious behavior and refusal
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.760]   to attend church.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.720]   She invited me to visit Berean with her and when I joined the youth group, I saw believers
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.200]   who were my age or even younger who had genuine faith and lived a life that truly reflected
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.880]   that.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.800]   Instead of being encouraged at the time, I felt ashamed that all the years I'd spent
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.520]   growing up in the church had led me to this point of living a double life, feeling guilty
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.480]   and turning on my Christian act every Friday and Sunday, yet returning to my self-serving,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.360]   sin-ruled lifestyle every day in between.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.640]   My pride and unwillingness to accept the challenge of rebuilding my faith led to a long period
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.360]   of struggle between wanting to hold on to this newfound worldly freedom and the salvation
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.160]   I knew I dearly needed.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.640]   During a youth retreat in February of 2020, Pastor Nate spoke on cultivating a hunger
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.600]   and desire for the Bible.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.600]   He said, "A hunger and thirst for the word can't be artificially generated.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.200]   Only the believer truly cherishes his word.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.480]   And if you say, 'I need God,' and don't immediately turn to the Bible, you don't believe you truly
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   need God."
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.680]   I remember him reading John 11, 25 to 26, in which Jesus says, "I am the resurrection
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.720]   and the life.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.880]   He who believes in me will live, even if he dies.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.560]   And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.760]   Do you believe this?"
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.760]   For the first time, I felt truly confronted with the question, "Are you a believer?"
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.640]   Up until then, I had never even considered that I might not be saved, since I had done
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   all the right things.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.120]   I went to church since I was young, memorized Bible verses, served, and even got baptized.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.160]   But as I considered the lifestyle of an unbeliever reflective of complacency and unrepentant sin,
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.000]   there was a moment of realization when I finally accepted that despite all the years of playing
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.360]   the part of being a Christian, there was no gray area.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.880]   I had no relationship of God and nothing of Christ in me.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.000]   The weight of this realization and recognition of the consequences of my status as a transgressor
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.360]   against the holy God had set in, and I understood for the first time why the good news truly
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.800]   is good news to a sinner like myself.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.960]   Looking back now, it was truly only possible by God's mercy and grace that my hardened
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.880]   heart of unbelief was softened, and my eyes were opened to see the utter sin and depravity
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.880]   in my life.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.600]   I was convicted of countless sins as I began taking baby steps as an infant believer and
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.780]   reading the Bible, praying, and making my relationship with God personal for myself.
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.700]   As a result, my life began to change as I let go of the worldly things I had held onto
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.640]   so tightly in light of this newfound treasure that had been revealed to me.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.440]   Since then, I've still fallen into sin and no doubt will continue to until the day I
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.240]   die, but I trust that I am being sanctified through each and every trial and triumph in
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.200]   life all for the glory of God as I strive to live out the calling of all Christians
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   having received and being a steward of God's grace.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   Thank you.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   [applause]
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:32.200]   [applause]
