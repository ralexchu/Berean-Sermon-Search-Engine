[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   - Good morning.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.280]   My name is Lauren and I'm a recent graduate from UC Riverside and it's a privilege to
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.080]   be able to share with you this morning how God has worked in my life.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.800]   I had grown up attending church every Sunday as early as I can remember.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.440]   I have fond memories of it from when I was a child, but still I would not have considered
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.920]   myself a church kid as many people's testimonies would go and there are many reasons for that.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.840]   Since early childhood, I was taught about God and as I would graduate into the next
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.960]   ministries as I got older, my curiosity would ever so slightly grow too.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.320]   Transitioning into middle school, I moved to a different area and before that I had
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.960]   never dealt with change in my life.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.520]   During that time in youth ministry, I found the pastor's messages very engaging and encouraging
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.200]   to my troubled soul.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.280]   In seventh grade, I went on a retreat.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.080]   There God revealed his presence to me through worship and prayer.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.560]   For the first time, I felt that God was in the same room as me and that he wanted to
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.720]   have a relationship with me.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.120]   The church I went to did not emphasize the importance of being in the word.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.760]   My relationship with him was vague, but my desire to be near him was strong.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.000]   I only knew God to be a feeling, so when life continued to move, I fell away due to my lack
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   of foundation.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.520]   In my first year of high school, my church relocated.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.600]   Many of my friends went to a different church.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.600]   The remaining people were all very close to each other, being family friends and going
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.600]   to the same school.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.680]   Though I knew most of them my whole life, it was a group that was difficult to infiltrate.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.720]   My family seemed to share the same sentiment and slowly we stopped going.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.880]   Finally, I found myself in a relationship very early in my first year of high school.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.440]   He was everything to me, my taste and my identity shaped by him, my friends attached to him,
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.360]   and my comfort and pride came from him.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.040]   He was not Christian and at the time, my relationship with God was something I still treasured and
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.680]   was chasing after.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.400]   I thought my faith was important to me.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.840]   I knew that this was something that a Christian was not supposed to do because of the many
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.800]   compromises that would arise.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.240]   I knew God was watching and would be displeased, but my lust and curiosity led me to continue
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240]   anyway.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.040]   I felt like I was building a wall thicker and thicker between me and God because I couldn't
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.920]   face him and the guilt only started to fade away as my heart began to harden.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.360]   But even still, I knew that God saw right through this wall and being on the other side,
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.560]   I saw right through this wall as well and yet I couldn't reach him.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.920]   There was something in me that still desired the comfort I had felt that I only knew came
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.200]   from God.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.360]   After a couple years, we broke up and naturally my whole world shattered.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.600]   We shared the same friends who would circumstantially reveal that their loyalty sided with him.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.440]   I sought to fill the void in my heart with other relationships, but instead hurt those
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.280]   I used selfishly for physical and emotional comfort and lost almost all of the remaining
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.240]   friends I had.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.300]   As much as I wanted to care about, didn't want to care about anything anymore going
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.800]   into college, I learned very quickly that drinking and searching for validation in others
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.200]   was also vanity and also led to emptiness.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.840]   Still early in my first year of college, I was invited to attend a retreat by one of
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.400]   the Christian fellowships on campus by a hallmate of mine.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.200]   I really had nothing to lose and I also thought that I hadn't been in a Christian retreat
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.880]   in a while, so I agreed.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.320]   I got to the retreat and I was excited to meet people, but during the morning devotional,
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.000]   God met me through his word.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.280]   I knew that he brought me there for a reason and I promised to him that I would hear him
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.720]   out with what he had to say that weekend and God challenged me through this promise.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:40.040]   Through the messages and through the conversations I had with people, I realized how little I
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.640]   knew about Christianity.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.120]   There were so many concepts I've never heard of and I was shocked to learn how much I misunderstood,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.920]   not even knowing the gospel by name, but just as a mere story in the Bible.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.000]   For the first time, I had met people who exuded joy because of their close relationship with
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.400]   Christ and they naturally poured out a love that was supernatural.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.640]   During a Q&A, I sat in distress learning about what Christians believed and why and how it
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.400]   contradicted to the values that I held that were shaped by the world.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.560]   I had told God that I would hear him out and I knew that if I chose one of these world
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.360]   views, I would have to completely reject the other.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:23.000]   A staffer approached me and walked me through a few of my questions and through the gospel
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.360]   once more and asked me if I wanted to accept Christ in my life.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.600]   Although my understanding was elementary, I knew very well that there was nowhere else
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.840]   to run that would be able to fill the emptiness in my heart.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.640]   I realized then it wasn't God who wasn't answering to me all these years, but me who did not
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.640]   listen.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.720]   All of my life, I had sinned against the holy God who created me and loved me even though
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.000]   I deserved eternal death.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.960]   God already shed his love for me by sending his one and only begotten son to die on the
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.480]   cross for my sins.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.080]   And as a sinner, I could do nothing to repay such a debt I owe to the one and only who
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.160]   deserves my worship and praise.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.840]   I prayed to accept Christ and give him my life.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.800]   From that point on, I was like a sponge wanting to know everything about God and soak in everything.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.560]   And as the years in college passed, God continued to walk with me and sanctify me.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.280]   And though it was challenging at times, I saw my desires change and my joy grow in him
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.040]   as I learned more about God's character.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.880]   And seeing even more greatly each day how depraved I was and still am makes me tremble
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.960]   in fear and awe and beyond grateful for this grace that I've been given.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.000]   All I have and is for Christ.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Thank you.
