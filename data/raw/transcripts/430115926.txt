[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hello everyone.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.960]   We're gonna be studying this passage of Ephesians
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.840]   and in chapter five, verses 15 through 21,
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.040]   paragraph is called, or the title of this study
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.880]   is called Walk Carefully and Wisely.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.840]   And before we begin, I just have a quick couple
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.440]   just tips wise.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.000]   I provide about four or five inductive study questions
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.880]   for the passage.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000]   Please try your best to answer those questions,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.200]   but if you don't have the time to sit
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.400]   and work through all those questions,
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.800]   it's actually better for you to just sit down,
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.760]   take a piece of paper and try to make
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.000]   as many personal observations that you can.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.840]   Trying to notice what's in the passage
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.680]   and just trying to outline the passage for yourself.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.880]   Potentially you might gain a lot more than that.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.200]   The other thing is, although I do provide
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.040]   the handout and things like that,
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.800]   I do always recommend working from your Bible.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.480]   That way you have your affinity towards the text
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.320]   that you're working with,
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.640]   but also just for retention and memory wise,
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.200]   it's proven to really help in terms of that arena.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.600]   So let's take a moment to pray
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.640]   and then jump into the study.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.720]   Lord, we thank you God for your grace.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.200]   Thank you Father for providing for us
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.200]   your fatherly instruction.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.800]   God desiring for us to exhibit
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.800]   greater sanctification in our lives.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.920]   What's more Father God, we thank you for your call
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.920]   for us to live in such a fashion that God,
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.600]   we are emulating you, reflecting you,
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.800]   but walking also in your wisdom.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.400]   We pray that you would help us to both understand
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.440]   and to apply your word.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.760]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.240]   Okay.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.200]   So let me take a moment to read to us
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.640]   the passage for this study.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.080]   And it's from Ephesians chapter five, verses 15 through 21.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.600]   And it says, "Therefore be careful how you walk,
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.720]   not as unwise, but as wise,
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.280]   making the most of your time because the days are evil.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.660]   So then do not be foolish,
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.760]   but understand what the will of the Lord is.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.720]   And do not get drunk with wine for that is dissipation,
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.720]   but be filled with the spirit,
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.120]   speaking to one another in Psalms and hymns
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.560]   and spiritual songs,
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.880]   singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.940]   Always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord,
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.400]   Jesus Christ, to God, even the father,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.960]   and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ."
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.920]   As we take a look at this passage,
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.120]   we wanna take a moment to review
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.440]   that we have been receiving lots of instructions to walk
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.360]   in such a fashion that reflects the gospel.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.120]   Starting from chapter four, verse one,
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.520]   recall that we were challenged to walk
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.400]   in a manner worthy of the calling.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.200]   And that entailed walking then in humility,
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.380]   walking in love, walking in care, and walking in unity.
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.440]   In chapter five, verse one,
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.320]   the scriptures called us to imitate God as children,
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.520]   as beloved children of the Lord.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.000]   And the command was for us to walk in love.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.400]   In our previous section,
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.280]   we were challenged to walk as children of light,
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.120]   no longer living in darkness,
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.080]   no longer living in that kind of foolishness
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.920]   or in immorality and greed and covetousness,
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.600]   but to walk in the light.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.680]   And here we're being called to walk carefully in wisdom.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.120]   So as we take a look at the passage,
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.240]   I have this kind of a messy slide here
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.880]   with lots of colors and things indented.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.360]   But you see what I'm doing here
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.960]   is just making sure that I observe
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.240]   where are the major commandments, okay?
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.360]   So what I mean by the major commandments
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.080]   is that here we have in purple,
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.920]   therefore be careful how you walk.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.080]   Right there is a standalone command.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.880]   It's an imperative in the second person.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.920]   And it's essentially saying you need to be careful
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.680]   in the way that you live your life.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.320]   This sentence here, making the most of your time,
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.980]   is underneath that.
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.400]   Verse 17, do not be foolish, okay?
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.960]   But understand what the will of the Lord is.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   Verse 18, do not be drunk with wine,
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.200]   but be filled with the spirit.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.420]   Major command.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.960]   Jumping down to verse 21,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.880]   and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ, okay?
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.840]   So outlining this passage,
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.520]   essentially I would take those major commands
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.560]   and summarize it and say, walk carefully and wisely.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.200]   Verse 17, understand God's will.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.820]   Verse 18, be filled with the spirit.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.380]   And verse 21, humble yourself.
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.380]   In these many ways, we are to exercise a careful walk,
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.100]   but more so than anything, exercise the will of God
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.880]   and the wisdom of God.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.720]   So this is us being wise through the gospel.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.040]   Let's begin then with the first commandment
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.560]   and jump into the study here.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.540]   The first commandment is to walk carefully
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.980]   and walk wisely.
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.020]   The passage says, therefore be careful how you walk,
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.420]   not as unwise men, but as wise,
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.380]   making the most of your time because the days are evil.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.640]   I would like to sometimes ask,
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.480]   even amongst the four commandments
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.580]   that we just saw as an overview,
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.160]   which one is most important
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.600]   or which one takes most emphasis?
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.800]   And what's interesting is within this paragraph,
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.420]   we realize his challenge on a broad scale
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.440]   is be careful in what you're doing, right?
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.620]   Take a look at this.
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.180]   In the Greek, there's a kind of strange,
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.240]   or I guess, but more emphatic formation
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.020]   of this command and challenge for us
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.960]   to be careful how we walk.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.400]   If you were to take literal translation of each word,
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.060]   it reads like this.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.440]   See then accurately how you walk around, okay?
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.040]   See then accurately.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.420]   And the challenge for us then is to be not haphazard,
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.240]   is to not just be on autopilot or cruise control,
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.460]   but to make sure that we're giving special attention
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.740]   to what we're doing.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.220]   And therefore, by immediate just kind of reflection
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.180]   upon this commandment,
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.500]   we need to be asking ourselves and meditating,
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.460]   am I paying attention?
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.420]   And do I have the humility to examine what I'm doing
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.280]   and to assess, is this wise?
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.380]   Are we asking the question,
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.040]   are we doing anything that's actually like wasteful?
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.960]   Are we doing anything that's actually hurtful?
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.640]   And by further meditation,
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.600]   I should be asking myself the question,
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.040]   if the challenges don't be unwise, but be wise,
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.640]   so you have this compare and contrast,
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.600]   do I know what's in these buckets, right?
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.720]   Meaning, what does it mean to be unwise?
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.920]   What's the stuff that happens when you're not careful
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.480]   and you're not wise?
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.100]   So you take time to meditate upon that.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.600]   And I have a couple of things for you
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.340]   as consequences of a foolish life.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.580]   What do I mean?
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.040]   Think about anything that you're doing.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.620]   Think about even just putting together furniture.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.880]   Think about trying to fix something in your house.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.880]   Think about a project that you're involved with.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.440]   Think about church ministry.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.160]   Think about, you know, whatever it may be,
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.140]   different major facets of your life.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.340]   What happens if you're not careful?
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.760]   Typically, when the scripture describes a fool
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.420]   and when you're not cautious,
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.760]   you end up hurting yourself, right?
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.920]   You're walking, you're not careful, you stub your toe,
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.760]   right?
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.460]   You're working, you're not careful, you cut your own hand.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.080]   You end up hurting yourself.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.480]   And that's what the scripture calls you fool.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.520]   You don't understand.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.640]   You do these things, you pursue these, you know, ends,
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.600]   you have these agendas.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.400]   And in the end, it's counterproductive.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.920]   You end up hurting yourself.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.760]   But worse than that, you end up hurting others, right?
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.160]   If you're not careful, you're swinging your ax,
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.000]   you're swinging your hammer, you're doing the cut,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.760]   whatever it may be, what project that you're doing,
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.760]   you end up hurting others.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.660]   What's more, scriptures many times calls the fool,
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.480]   the fool who's not paying attention
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.320]   and so is absolutely wasteful.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.560]   Right now, I'm doing my personal devotions
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.080]   in the book of Ecclesiastes and King Solomon
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.320]   is just constantly asking the question,
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.200]   and what do you actually produce through that?
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.560]   What's the point?
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.400]   Vanity, vanity, vanity, right?
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.440]   Like the call for us to pay attention
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.020]   is a call for us to not simply waste our time
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.680]   and opportunities.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.980]   As a matter of fact, I mean, you think about even again,
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.300]   maybe building a piece of Ikea furniture,
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.160]   it's very simple.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.440]   So you just think, you know what, I'm just gonna do it.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.200]   You start going and then you realize,
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.680]   ah, I missed a step.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.080]   And so you have to make a choice now.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.520]   I have to dismantle the whole thing
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.800]   to make sure that peg's in there and make it strong.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.960]   Or you know what, ah, it'll just stand.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.160]   And next thing you know, you're working
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.600]   with a really insecure,
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.300]   or I guess unfinished piece of furniture.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.520]   What a waste.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.120]   And we end up having to do things twice.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.320]   What's more, if we're not careful,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.280]   the scripture says you just run with the world.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.680]   You run with the masses, you pursue worldly desires,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.480]   you pursue worldly ends.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.320]   And next thing you know,
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.440]   you're not even about God's business anymore.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.680]   So here are the things again,
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.400]   that the scripture many times talks about
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.600]   as a challenge for us, pay attention.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.480]   And for me personally, I feel like in recent days,
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.680]   in these last several weeks even,
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.520]   whether it's from just the community groups,
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.040]   the fellowship time with the guys,
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.120]   this personal interaction, I've been really challenged.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.320]   Like, am I paying attention to what I'm doing?
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.080]   For example, sometimes you, and we all get busy.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.320]   Like every single one of us gets busy
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.040]   and we have this desire to make sure everything gets done.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   But in busyness, the danger is you want to get things done
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.940]   for the end goal of just getting it done.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.420]   You're not even desiring in the specific task,
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.320]   in the specific moment,
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.720]   am I actually filling the need of the people?
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.040]   Am I actually filling the need of the hour?
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.560]   Scripture says that even when we're talking,
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.000]   even when we're speaking,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.400]   your words should be filled with grace,
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.120]   which means there's an intentional love in there.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.720]   And what's more, it should meet the needs of the hour.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.120]   Like, you don't just flippantly throw out careless words.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.360]   And I got to confess sometimes like in a means to just,
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.800]   and there was a time where I was just actually
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.220]   taking metrics, like I know some of you guys,
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.880]   I've been so slow to get to email.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.880]   So I've been taking metrics.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.080]   How long does it take me to respond to a message
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.480]   or an email, right?
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.040]   Sometimes it's like two days and I'm like,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.140]   oh man, somebody holds the record at our church
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.200]   for longest time before Pastor Mark replies
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   was two months.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.480]   I'm sorry, okay, you know who you are.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.640]   But sometimes my goal ends up becoming,
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.560]   at the end of the day, my inbox should be empty
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.960]   as opposed to, right, greater goals.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.800]   At the end of the day,
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.240]   I made sure that the project was going well,
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.920]   that if we're working together,
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.760]   if we're serving together, that everything actually,
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.080]   people are in the know of what's going on,
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.560]   that they're feeling a sense of being fulfilled,
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.680]   or contributing to this project,
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.160]   and all this kind of stuff, you know?
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.320]   And so I got to confess, sometimes realize just like
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.500]   there is a carelessness and in the end, again, what happens?
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.280]   We kind of miss the goal.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.200]   And I think one of the greatest things that happens
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.400]   when we're not careful is that the priorities of God
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.320]   get subjugated and neglected
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.920]   because we have these other things going on.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.480]   And that's such a huge challenge, right?
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.600]   People talk about like, oh, I don't have enough time,
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.640]   and I don't have enough of this.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.240]   And actually, scripture is saying, no, no, no.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.700]   You never have enough time for everything.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.360]   What you need is not just more time.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.280]   You just, if you had three more hours, four more hours,
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.440]   well, what's three more hours
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.880]   if your priorities are all over the place?
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.640]   What's four more hours if your heart is all over the place
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.860]   and you just want to do everything else?
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.800]   What you need is focus because instilled in the reality
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.920]   of every single one of our lives
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.520]   is we don't have enough time for everything.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.800]   And what's more, I think scripturally,
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.600]   when the Bible talks to us and commands us
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.200]   to exercise wisdom, it's precisely talking about the fact
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.720]   that we need to watch our life and our doctrine
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.000]   and what's coming out of our mouths closely.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.480]   We need to be wise.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.960]   And if you think about 1 Corinthians 2,
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.840]   you don't have to turn there,
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.120]   but I just want to talk about the general wisdom.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.120]   Scripture says that this world has its own wisdom
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.760]   or what it thinks is valuable, what it thinks is priority.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.960]   But you, you now have the mind of God.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.840]   You know what you think, sorry,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.120]   you know what God thinks is wise.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.080]   And so therefore, everything that we're participating in,
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.020]   everything that we're doing is actually spiritually appraised.
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.840]   It's spiritually valued.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.560]   And therefore for us, that to us,
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.180]   when we exercise that is our wisdom.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.760]   So I wanted to spend a lot of time on that
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.640]   because that is the thrust.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.960]   That's the main exhortation as a propositional statement
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.480]   at the beginning of the paragraph, you need to be careful.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.460]   Secondly, the commandment is to redeem the time.
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.840]   Notice here in verse 16, the passage says,
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.740]   "Making the most of your time because the days are evil."
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.000]   So let's make an observation here.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.900]   What does it mean to make the most of your time?
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.000]   I mean, we can just use synonymous and say,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.120]   "Hey, maximize your time, don't waste it."
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.720]   So essentially we remember when we were in school,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.680]   our parents would tell us, "Prioritize,
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.400]   prioritize and make sure you're using your time wisely.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.000]   Do your work first before you play, focus."
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.980]   That's the kind of maybe exhortation we may feel.
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.960]   But here and now there's more to that.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.440]   The term to maximize, or I guess make the most,
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.920]   actually means more literally to buy it all out.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.080]   So when you look at those dictionary entries
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.580]   of what a word means, a lot of times they're comparing
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.280]   how is this word used in other Greek literature?
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.040]   How is it used more specifically
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.080]   in other passages of the Bible?
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.360]   And in other passages of the Bible,
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.120]   this term is used to purchase it all.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.520]   Or it's also used of Christ when he's purchased us.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.420]   So when you think about this then,
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.880]   there's more to it than, "Yeah, just use your time wisely."
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.040]   There is this heart where you want to,
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.800]   imagine you're into something,
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.400]   like let's say you're into woodworking.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.480]   Now all of a sudden your heart is into wanting to buy
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.800]   all the necessary tools to get this done.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.480]   Because this project that you have,
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.120]   let's say you're building a piece of furniture like a chair,
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.360]   you wanna make sure you have all the paint brushes
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.520]   for the finish, including the drill bits,
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.460]   including the nails, including like all of that, right?
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.080]   And in that sense, whenever your heart is into something,
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.960]   you want to make sure you have all the pieces.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.440]   And for those of you guys who are into like tools,
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.360]   you want all the tools for every scenario, right?
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.860]   You know what that feels like, buy it all, right?
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.700]   Don't go buy it all.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.520]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.680]   Here is the heart behind wanting to make the most
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.140]   of the time, you're all in in that moment.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.880]   What's more, other passages of scripture really tell us
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.240]   to make the most of every opportunity.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.480]   Colossians chapter four,
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.040]   "Conduct yourselves with wisdom towards outsiders,
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.080]   making the most of the opportunity.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.360]   Let your speech always be with grace,
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.580]   as though seasoned with salt,
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.240]   so that you will know how you should respond to each person."
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.240]   Galatians six, "So then while we have opportunity,
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.360]   let us do good to all people,
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.680]   and especially to those who are of the household
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.520]   of the faith."
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.600]   What a challenge for us to redeem the time
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.480]   that we want to make sure we are maximizing
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.600]   the moment that we have.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.240]   And I wanna highlight that because
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.040]   when we look at this passage, oops,
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.720]   it says, "Because the days are evil,"
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.160]   and we should take a moment to meditate on that, right?
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.880]   The timeframe, the days that we have are evil.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.200]   And I'm gonna leave that to your discussion.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.720]   But in terms of what does that mean?
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.080]   Does that mean like the generation that we're in,
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.080]   just like Jesus said, what a wicked generation,
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.400]   a perverse generation.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.560]   It was wicked and perverse then,
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.000]   it's wicked and perverse now, right?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.600]   Is that what he means?
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.800]   Well, what's really interesting is another thing to notice
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.560]   is that when he uses the word time here,
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.460]   so right here on make the most of your time,
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.080]   when he uses this idea of time,
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.400]   it doesn't mean like the hours
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.360]   and the moments that you have.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.800]   I want you to go make a schedule
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.440]   and every single moment needs to have some kind of
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.840]   like things slotted into it.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.080]   Maybe you could, right?
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.620]   It'd be great if we could read and pray and evangelize
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.460]   and do nothing else.
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.720]   But honestly speaking,
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.480]   there are so many other things and responsibilities
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.040]   in your life, right?
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.000]   You gotta take care of your family, you have to work, right?
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.400]   You have to do all these kinds of things.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.000]   But the idea is you should understand
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.380]   that there is a period of time you have.
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.660]   And that's the word used, the Greek word used,
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.360]   it actually is more specific to not chronos,
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.560]   but it's more specific to the time that you have
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.200]   as a period, it's a season, okay?
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.240]   So we recognize that we have limitations
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.280]   and we have to be careful then with those limitations.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.360]   As just an encouragement to you,
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.480]   for me as I think about it,
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.360]   I personally was very challenged by this
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.400]   because I love learning stuff.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.760]   And some people have commented
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.560]   that I'm kind of like a Jack of all trades.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.340]   And that to me, it's not necessarily
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.820]   I wanted to be a Jack of all trades,
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.120]   I just like learning a lot of stuff.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.480]   The second half of that little idiom,
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.280]   Jack of all trades, master of none, okay?
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.680]   I don't like the master of none part,
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.520]   but that's also true, I'm master of nothing, okay?
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.760]   And, but the thing about it is,
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.160]   as I look upon that and look upon, let's say my life,
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.880]   truthfully speaking, there's so much vanity and waste.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.520]   And what I mean by that is,
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.500]   like I pretty much, when it comes to sports,
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.640]   I have pretty much every equipment that you could need.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.260]   I have a badminton set I haven't touched in two years.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.720]   I have tennis rackets, I have like three of them,
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.960]   including Bia's, like both of us played tennis
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.800]   in high school.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.200]   We love tennis, haven't played in years.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.560]   I have a basketball, football, volleyball, soccer ball.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.840]   I mean, you could just go down the list, right?
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.440]   You have pretty much everything related to sports.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.360]   You talk about musical instruments.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.680]   I mean, I want my kids to learn music.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.400]   So for their birthday, there's a ukulele we got,
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.840]   we got a hand-me-down piano, they have a guitar at home,
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.600]   they have an old violin, like I want them to do everything.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.160]   I mean, talk about like, let's say fixing stuff.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.320]   I mean, I have car parts I have yet to install.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.600]   I've been sitting there for six months.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.640]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.600]   And when you think about that, we are such so privileged
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.960]   that we are allowed to have so many hobbies.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.260]   And yet part of it is, the problem is,
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.040]   our hearts wants to do everything.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.400]   And I think there's like a warning there.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.240]   Is it wrong?
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.420]   No, it's not wrong to have hobbies.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.480]   There's a warning because that could be vanity.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.000]   King Solomon says, you know what I did?
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   I grew a green thumb.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.440]   He said, I planted vineyards, I have gardens,
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.600]   I have majestic gardens.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.400]   And then he says, vanity of vanities.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.920]   And it makes sense.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.400]   It makes sense.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.720]   And you know what the strange thing is,
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.600]   I almost had like a desire to share with you
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.280]   some worldly advice, like don't be this guy
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.440]   who has your hand in everything and have hobbies all around.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.160]   Just pick one that you really, really like
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.880]   and become a skilled individual
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.480]   because then you could use that, right?
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.320]   But that too.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.160]   So what if you're like the master of carpentry?
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.920]   Let's say you were the number one prospect of a sport.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.480]   That too could be vanity.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.880]   Unless we have a desire to glorify God.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.880]   Unless we have a desire to serve people.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.440]   Unless we have a desire to, in some ways,
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.360]   use that as a platform for an element.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.000]   You know, it doesn't have to be always like,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.240]   I'm gonna preach that Christ crucified and he resurrected
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.120]   and da-da-da-da-da, that would be great.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.280]   But even right now, what I think is really encouraging
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.120]   is people using their skills,
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.560]   their stuff that they have and their services
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.320]   to raise funds for a great cause,
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.840]   like that's really awesome.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.440]   Two thumbs up for that.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.320]   When you use it for those kind of purposes
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.880]   and you realize, yes, you have the responsibility
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.960]   to work and do it excellently,
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.320]   but if it stops there, that too could be vanity, right?
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.560]   We have greater causes, essentially.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.360]   Okay.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.360]   So again, we realize what a command and challenge for us
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.640]   in this first two verses for us to be careful,
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:34.000]   to be wise and to maximize the opportunity that we have.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.200]   Okay.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   The other commandments we're gonna go through
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.520]   just a little bit faster.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.200]   Commandment number three is,
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.400]   understand the will of the Lord.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.520]   Okay, understand the will of the Lord.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.400]   He says here, so then do not be foolish.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.360]   And we already talked a lot about what foolishness means.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.200]   Foolish means you just don't understand like
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.400]   what you're doing.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.280]   You're like not paying attention to
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.360]   if you're even achieving the right goal.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.520]   You're hurting people, you're hurting yourself, right?
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.360]   But then he says,
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.760]   understand what is the will of the Lord, right?
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.480]   You gotta understand what God desires.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.480]   And I just wanna make a mention that the command,
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.040]   yes, is to understand,
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.360]   but we know that regularly in scripture,
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.160]   it means so much more than say,
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.800]   ah, I get it.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.440]   No, it means to understand so you can do, right?
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.080]   It means to understand so you can implement it.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.520]   But I wanna highlight this thing.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.280]   As a believer,
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.760]   your growing wisdom is your growing understanding
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.240]   of what is the will of the Lord.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.760]   We talked about in previous passages,
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.120]   you have to have a mental picture in your mind.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.040]   Are the things that I'm doing,
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.760]   lifting a pleasant aroma to God,
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.280]   or is it a stink, right?
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.560]   Is what I'm doing in line with what God is pleased by?
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.560]   Does he like it?
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.120]   Do you know of God well enough
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.880]   that in the things you're doing,
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.080]   you could almost picture him looking at you
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.760]   and be like, no, right?
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.280]   Can you picture that?
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.080]   That to you is your wisdom as a child of God.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.760]   Father's day is coming up.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.560]   And if you're thinking about what should I get my dad?
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.120]   The first question is, what does he like?
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.920]   And if you're sitting there like,
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.240]   I don't know.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.800]   Listen, you have a bigger problem than finding a gift.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.200]   You need to get to know your father better, right?
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.120]   If you can't think of anything your father likes,
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.640]   you don't even know what he likes, right?
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.480]   It's different.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.520]   Like when buying a gift,
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.640]   you know what people like,
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.200]   and sometimes you don't know whether they already have it
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.400]   or they don't have it, right?
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.320]   That's another issue.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.440]   But if you're sitting there like,
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.280]   I don't know what he likes,
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.240]   I don't know his preferences,
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.880]   I don't know if he's gonna enjoy this,
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   then you really need to grow in your understanding of God.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.360]   I think an arena where this applies a lot too,
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.400]   is in marriage.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.080]   What I mean is understanding God's will
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.840]   makes you wise in marriage.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.080]   Understanding God's will makes you good in marriage,
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.080]   a good husband and a good wife.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.120]   You know, some people say a key to a happy marriage
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.200]   is good communication.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.240]   And when communication is bad, marriage is bad.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.120]   Yeah, there's some credence to that because,
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.840]   you know, people don't communicate well.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.640]   If you're sitting there and you don't have the maturity
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:22.640]   to say certain things with calm, with control,
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.080]   you're gonna ruin the marriage.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.360]   And people make much of like,
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.520]   you know, men are from Mars and women are from Venus
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.000]   and you just don't understand each other
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.960]   and it's horrible, right?
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.960]   Well, yeah, typically men don't know
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.440]   how to express things into words.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.520]   They're not used to like digging deep
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.160]   and why did I do this?
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.720]   And what am I feeling right now?
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.640]   It's just, we're not used to it, all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.480]   We need to grow.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.200]   A part of it, you just need to grow.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.160]   And also ladies, you know,
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.280]   and the way that they communicate,
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.920]   sometimes it could be with a kind of complaint
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.840]   or whatever it may be and we need to grow.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.480]   I don't know, like there's differences
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   in the way that we communicate.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.760]   Sometimes we're more verbose, sometimes we're not.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.800]   Sometimes we say things, sometimes we don't.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.760]   We need to grow.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.880]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.640]   that's not to me the best key to the relationship.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.480]   Why?
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.240]   I have seen people speak two different languages
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.840]   and yet make it work.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.040]   I have seen people who, yes, they need to grow
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:12.880]   and all that kind of stuff,
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.920]   but that may not be the key key, okay?
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.960]   The reason why is because,
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.200]   I think the key key is when a husband understands
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.560]   God's will, what pleases the Lord,
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.120]   and he knows what he's supposed to be doing,
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.480]   that's the key.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.560]   Because what's incredibly frustrating on any team,
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.960]   whether it be a sports team,
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.480]   whether it's in a business team,
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.440]   whether it's in a school team,
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.680]   whatever it may be,
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.720]   if an individual is unwilling and unknowing
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.160]   of what they're supposed to do,
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.720]   automatically it's dysfunctional, right?
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.400]   Automatically it's dysfunctional.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.560]   And that's what I'm talking about here.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.320]   What's worse than a person who perhaps doesn't even know
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.600]   what they're supposed to be doing,
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.400]   is a person who in their selfishness, laziness, rebellion,
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.320]   they know what they're supposed to be doing,
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.840]   but they're in disobedience.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.200]   The fool does not obey God.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.960]   The fool doesn't know what the Lord likes.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.480]   And within marriage, if a husband or a wife,
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.800]   they don't know their God-given,
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.400]   what God is pleased by as he sees a husband,
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.200]   but if they don't know what God is pleased by
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.480]   of what he sees as a wife,
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.800]   then yeah, that relationship is already on the rocks.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.440]   And that's why we're talking about here,
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.720]   what's wise when we see the Lord is to abide in him.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:40.440]   What's wise is the desire to know what he is pleased by.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.360]   Next, commandment number four, be filled with the spirit.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.440]   Be filled with the spirit.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.520]   The passage commands us and says,
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.160]   and do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation,
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.160]   but be filled with the spirit,
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.200]   speaking to one another in Psalms, hymns,
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.320]   and spiritual songs,
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.960]   singing, making melody with your heart to the Lord,
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.920]   always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord,
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.240]   Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.160]   Now here and now is a beefy chunk of text
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:14.120]   that could even like require an hour of study on its own.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.920]   We don't have the time for that.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.600]   So we're just gonna make some major observations
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.840]   and move forward from there.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.440]   Take a look at this observation.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.160]   You recognize there is this contrast.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.640]   Before it said, don't be fool, be wise, right?
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.720]   Don't be careless, be wise.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.760]   Don't be a fool, understand what the will of the Lord is.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.280]   Here it says, don't get drunk, for that is dissipation.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.640]   So when you have this kind of comparing contrast,
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.040]   but be filled with the spirit,
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.520]   you have, in order to kind of appreciate it,
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.280]   you gotta really appreciate the contrast, okay?
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.800]   And so we have to ask this question,
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.280]   what is it about drunkenness?
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.600]   And what's interesting is the passage describes drunkenness
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.200]   as dissipation.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.560]   What's more, I started asking this question,
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.600]   why do people love getting drunk so much?
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.640]   What is appealing about drunkenness
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.320]   that some people would actually desire drunkenness
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.240]   over being filled with the spirit of God?
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.800]   Why does this world, the unsaved world,
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.680]   turn to drunkenness so much?
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.720]   Why is it that pretty much every holiday,
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.440]   every celebration, it involves alcohol?
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.000]   People get married, woo-hoo, drinks.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.360]   People have their birthdays, woo-hoo, drinks.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.880]   It's St. Patrick's Day, woo-hoo, let's drink, right?
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.960]   People, you know, when they go to sporting events
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.960]   and their team wins, woo,
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.800]   let's just shower each other with champagne, right?
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.320]   Like, what is it with drinking?
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.480]   And one of the things I realize is
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.040]   people turn to drinking for a sense of joy.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.760]   It is celebration.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.200]   It's to them the expression of joy and happiness.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.360]   But on the flip side, you know what's also interesting?
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.560]   People turn to drinking when they're sad.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.800]   Drinking alcoholism is depressing,
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.800]   and they want to drink away their worries and sorrows.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.320]   They're disappointed with this world?
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.200]   Go drink.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.320]   They just got in a fight?
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.320]   Go drink.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.960]   They're pissed off 'cause they got laid off at work?
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.040]   Go to the bar.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.480]   People turn to alcohol when they're sad.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.280]   And what are they looking for?
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.560]   I think they're still looking for joy.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.720]   What's very interesting is this term for dissipation.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.200]   I mean, you get the idea, right?
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.040]   Dissipate.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.280]   It's like, it's windowing down, okay?
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.240]   And what's really interesting,
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.640]   it's a kind of a verbose word.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:28.640]   The literal term is to extravagantly squander, right?
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.240]   It's like, woo!
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.160]   And the picture that I got is a rich boy.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.680]   Like in our day, you have these rich people
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.000]   who are just like, "I'm gonna buy this.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.840]   I'm gonna buy that.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.800]   I'm gonna buy this."
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.920]   And what's very interesting is
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.200]   in one of the theological dictionaries of this term,
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.040]   the term is astos, they liken it to the prodigal son,
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.320]   one who spends so much,
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.920]   he slides easily into fatal influences of flattery,
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.400]   of temptation, and surrounds himself,
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.080]   spending freely to his own lusts and appetites.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:58.920]   Why?
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.160]   Because the prodigal son believed
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.200]   to spend his cash would be more happier and joyous
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.160]   than to be with his father, who's wealthy.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.240]   The prodigal son believed
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.560]   that that would be to him his greater freedom.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:18.280]   His wanton manner of living would be to him more satisfying.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.440]   Brothers and sisters,
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.560]   when the scripture says, "Be filled with spirit,"
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.960]   sometimes people are thinking like,
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.520]   "Let's be filled with power," right?
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.280]   Let's be filled with greater capacity to do stuff.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.000]   Well, potentially, yes, the spirit does empower us.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.400]   But here and now, the contrast is here being drunken on wine,
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.520]   that's dissipation, extravagant spending
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.040]   and squandering and waste, thinking you're satisfied.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.680]   But to be filled with the spirit,
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.600]   then in contrast, actually is to be filled with great joy
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.120]   because you have the Father's blessing.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.680]   You have God's goodwill.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.140]   Yes, you have his power.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.240]   You have his wisdom.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.760]   You have his purpose, his truth, his work.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.320]   You have him sufficiently.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.760]   And what you are resorting to,
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.120]   what you are using up and enjoying
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:15.240]   and taking to full advantage is the presence of God himself.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.200]   What you have is the control of God.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.160]   What you have is a resource of God.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.320]   And it's all consistent with the theme of Ephesians,
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.240]   "Blessed be God who has blessed us
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.400]   with every spiritual blessings in Christ in the heavens."
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:35.200]   We've been given everything and we need to be filled with it.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.120]   And that is the spirit of God.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.280]   Why do I say this?
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.080]   Because if you look at this observation,
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.160]   what he describes,
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.240]   underneath being filled with the spirit,
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:49.040]   what he describes is speaking with Psalms,
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.160]   hymns and spiritual songs,
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.120]   singing with making melody and giving thanks.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.400]   So when you're speaking and singing and giving,
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.560]   you're filled, you're satisfied.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.920]   And the way that I would like to put it
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.760]   is command number five is overflow with joy and thanksgiving.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.160]   To be filled with the spirit is descriptive of,
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.880]   or is described as having an overflow of joy
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.360]   and thanksgiving to our God
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.680]   and to our brothers and sisters, right?
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.400]   We need to be filled with truth,
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.400]   with songs of joy, with melody in our heart.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.880]   And this understanding, if you're wise,
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.720]   you have this understanding.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.360]   I have been made complete in Christ.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.720]   I have the spirit of God in dwelling in my heart,
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.360]   securing me, filling me.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.480]   And what that comes out in is an incredible confidence
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.880]   and also thankfulness.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.280]   Think about this,
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.520]   when a rich child, that rich child is spending his money.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.920]   What's really interesting is if you look
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.880]   not only at a snapshot of that child spending his money,
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.280]   you also see children of rich people killing themselves,
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.480]   suicide, ODing on drugs.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.680]   That's not just like one or two,
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.480]   we've seen it as a pattern amongst rich people,
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.200]   celebrity children, whatever it may be.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.440]   And you almost realize like there is a foolishness there.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.560]   You pretty much have it so good
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.120]   and yet you're so thankless.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:19.800]   You rage over stuff and then you get destructive.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.080]   There is a foolishness marked in that.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.960]   There is a wisdom marked in seeing the gospel,
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.600]   seeing the Savior, seeing his spirit,
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.440]   being filled with this truth and overflowing with gratitude.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.240]   That's to our wisdom.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.000]   Next, the final portion of this text says,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.800]   and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.320]   And so the commandment that we're to recognize
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:49.320]   is that in the wisdom of God, we need to humble ourselves.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:54.760]   If we are walking carefully, if you're walking in sight,
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.520]   you got your eyes open,
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.600]   then you need to be the most humble people.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.040]   Scripture tells us that if you know the will of God,
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.600]   sorry, the fear of God, if you know the fear of God,
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.480]   if you understand God's authority,
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.720]   you understand God's power, you understand who he is to us,
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.320]   that there is the beginning of wisdom
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.440]   because then we know how to humble ourselves,
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.920]   to walk humbly with God.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.000]   And therefore, if there's any heart in us
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.480]   that says like, "I'm the man,"
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.680]   that's absolute foolishness.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.080]   So what am I saying?
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.440]   Arrogance and pride is absolute stupidity.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.320]   It's silly.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.360]   If someone says, "I'm the man,"
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.320]   that means they haven't seen much, they're blind.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.880]   If someone says, "I'm better than you,"
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.640]   it means they're liars and they're deceived.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.960]   It's all foolishness.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.360]   And I want you to think about this scenario.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.640]   Given that sometimes we can make an appropriate judgment,
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.040]   you may be better than somebody in your work.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.040]   You're more successful.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.080]   I'm better than that person.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.400]   You can be, right?
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.000]   But think about the arrogance to say it.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.320]   What that means is all you are seeing is you
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.760]   and that singular individual you think you're better than.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.280]   But can you say it?
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.040]   I want you to think about this.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.640]   You know, lately Michael Jordan has been in the media a lot
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:14.800]   because there's a TV show.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.320]   And think about Michael Jordan,
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.600]   best player ever basketball-wise, right?
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.520]   Imagine you're in the locker room though.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.720]   And you realize, you know what?
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.880]   I'm better than somebody else.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.840]   Let's say you're in the locker room
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.720]   and you're better than that third string guy
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.920]   who never got playing minutes.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.400]   So you're just like, "Man, look at you, dude.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.120]   Oh, bench warmer," right?
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.600]   You saying that means you're just looking at that person
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.680]   but you don't recognize Michael Jordan's in the room.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.080]   He's gonna sit there and be like, "Oh, you're talking big.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.120]   You're talking big, man."
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.720]   And in front of him, he gets,
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.920]   you're gonna look like a fool
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.240]   because like you think you're that good.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.080]   Do you understand saying that kind of stuff in front of me?
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.920]   Right?
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.520]   And if you've ever seen this, like if you're an adult
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.160]   and you see kids like fighting each other in front of them
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.080]   and saying all this stuff,
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.360]   he may be better than the other kid.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.120]   But in the presence of an adult,
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.080]   and so for us as Christians,
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.360]   understanding and knowing that God is ever present,
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.320]   that before God, yes, I may be slightly better
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.840]   than another individual at something very specific.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:21.520]   To say that in his presence, it's just silly.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.320]   It's absolute foolishness.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.200]   I don't want you to think about this though.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.000]   Obviously this passage is not challenging us like,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.880]   "Hey, don't say arrogant stuff."
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.040]   It actually challenged us to submit to one another.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.480]   And I wanna ask you this question.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.880]   Did you think about what that means
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.920]   for you to subject yourself underneath somebody else?
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.480]   And the scripture is challenging us.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.680]   If you know the gospel and you know what Christ has done
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.840]   and you've seen him serve other people,
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:52.520]   for you to say like, "I can't, not that guy."
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:57.560]   That kind of logic has a disconnect
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.720]   and therefore makes you a fool.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:03.920]   You've seen the Lord of all, master, authority,
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.000]   serve sinners.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.280]   And for us, then to humble ourselves
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.600]   and be subservient to serve the better good
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.040]   of that other individual is just a logical connection.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.120]   That's the only thing that makes sense.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.960]   That's the way Christ projects the gospel.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.160]   If you, though being such a sinner, have been forgiven
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.880]   and you cannot forgive that other person,
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:32.400]   and you can't take your righteous standard
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.040]   and subject yourself to serve that other individual,
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.040]   you don't make sense.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.880]   You're a fool, right?
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.600]   That must've mean you haven't seen.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.680]   That must be that you don't see the realities.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.440]   And so as we take a look at these commandments,
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.680]   wow, what a challenge to be wise,
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.240]   logically consistent through the gospel,
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.640]   to be very careful in paying attention to what we're doing.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.160]   And we realize being filled with the knowledge of God to us
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.600]   and being aware of his presence,
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.160]   that to us is our greatest wisdom.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.080]   I mean, in our day,
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.000]   trying to focus on the spiritual is hard,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.120]   but that to us actually is our greatest reality.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.120]   And it prevents us being fools,
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.400]   not only just simply in this moment,
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.640]   but fools in terms of the context of all of eternity.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.240]   And so I pray that we would've been challenged
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.400]   to be all the more cautious
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.760]   and to be all the more wise in our daily living.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.600]   Let's pray.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.160]   God, thank you so much for your grace.
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.400]   Lord, your instruction for us to be wise
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.320]   according to your wisdom.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.000]   I pray, Lord, that you give us eyes to see the difference
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.200]   between what is the wisdom of man and the world
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.680]   versus the wisdom of God.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.840]   I also pray, Father God,
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.680]   that through those eyes,
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.520]   we're better able to assess and evaluate what is valuable,
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.940]   what is important and what is not.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.320]   I also pray, Father God,
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.840]   that all of this would translate into expressing
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.200]   and living in accordance to the wisdom of Christ.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.700]   I pray, Lord, that we would exhibit greater humility,
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.680]   that God, we would rely all the more on your wisdom
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.720]   for everyday scenarios.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.420]   And I pray that in doing so, we would exalt you.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.720]   We thank you in some Christ name we pray, amen.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:25.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
