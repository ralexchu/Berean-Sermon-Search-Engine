[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   Take it slow.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.560]   Ask yourself this question, what's the rush?
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.560]   Like why do you want to date so quickly?
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.560]   Like really sit down and ask yourself that.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.560]   If you feel like, like I want to date and I like this girl and really slow down and
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.560]   take it easy and say that.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.560]   Take it slow.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.560]   I like this girl and really slow down and take it easy and say that.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.360]   Are you content in God alone?
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.160]   Almost every time if someone comes up to me and asks me my opinion, I'm not singling
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.160]   people out.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.280]   I almost always say, hey give it a quarter.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.280]   I almost always say that.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.280]   I say just wait.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.640]   Just wait a quarter.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.440]   Just to see.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.560]   I have seen people who say, I'll ask like, hey when did you start liking them?
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.960]   Well week one.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.200]   When did you DTR with them?
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.200]   Week three.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.480]   It's like, no no give it more time.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.840]   How do you know that that person isn't the flavor of the week?
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.840]   You don't know.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840]   Like you just, you know?
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.840]   What's that?
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.840]   What's that?
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.840]   Oh I'm sorry.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.840]   Okay.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.840]   You know what I'm saying.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.840]   You know?
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.840]   Like how do you know that they're not just the next person on your list?
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.760]   And like, you don't know.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.840]   Because even in that statement you realize, man this is all about me, like what I want,
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.840]   right?
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.600]   Like have you really taken actual consideration and done the due diligence of even thinking
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.520]   about where they're at?
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.480]   A lot of times it might be like, oh but I saw her serving and she seems to be doing
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.480]   pretty well.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.800]   I'd be like, hey you need more than that.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.440]   I don't trust your sight.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.600]   You think, like your heart filled glazed sight on this girl saying like, oh she's like the
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.800]   one Pastor Nathan.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.480]   You know I've, there have been people who have come up to me and like they're all stressed
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.320]   out because they're like, I got a date now.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.320]   I asked them like, why now?
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.360]   Like just wait, hold on, see as much time as is needed.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.360]   And we'll tackle this in the next point.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.920]   As much time as is needed and then they'll be like, oh because like I don't want her
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.920]   to be snatched up.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.160]   I don't want him to be snatched up.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.160]   You know?
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.160]   And that's a real thing.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.680]   I've heard that many, many, many times.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.320]   But take it slow.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.960]   Bump the brakes.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.440]   Because at that point I'll ask the question.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.600]   Oh maybe, but are you content in God alone?
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.520]   Is he all you truly need?
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.840]   And why is it so hard to wait a little?
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.600]   You know?
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.680]   And sometimes you know, what I would like, what I kind of feel in my heart is like when
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.920]   people say someone might come and like snatch them up or you're like kind of worried about
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   that.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.920]   I really appreciate it if we're honest about that.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.920]   I really love it.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.900]   Because that's how I felt, you know?
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.160]   But the news flashes that person is not yours.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.760]   Right?
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.160]   So pump the brakes.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.120]   And then you've pumped it enough, right?
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.760]   You've given it some time.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.440]   You're thinking a little bit more soberly.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.200]   You're not so lovesick anymore.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.400]   You've really tested your heart.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   You've gone to your small group leader.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.880]   You've said, like where do you think I'm at?
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.880]   Can I just get your advice?
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.040]   Can I just get like where you think I am in character?
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.800]   Even regardless of this dating thing I'm talking about, like how am I doing?
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.040]   Where do you feel like I need to improve?
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.240]   And you think about all these things and you get to this place, you're like, okay, ask
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.240]   yourself this question then.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.240]   Am I ready?
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.240]   Am I ready to date?
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.840]   The question that you guys are all thinking right now is what does it mean to be ready?
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.440]   What does it mean to be mature?
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.360]   Usually when I ask this to people and I ask it to a lot of people, they'll like give the
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.360]   right answer.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.800]   They'll say, well, you know, I'm struggling with this and I'm not perfect here and this
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   is hard and, oh man, Pastor Nathan, I'm so sinful.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.160]   But Jesus, you know, that's what always happens.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.880]   But the grace of God overwhelms my soul and I sing praises in my brokenness.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.400]   You know, you do it like that, what does it truly mean to be ready or mature?
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.800]   Actually, you might not like the answer to this one, but the only way to see is what
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   we see in James.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.240]   Maturity is established through experience and trial.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.360]   In James chapter 1, verse 2 through 4, it says, "Consider it all joy, my brethren, when
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.840]   you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.760]   And let endurance have its perfect result so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.760]   in nothing."
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.000]   Remember, we've gone through this enough, but this is important.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.360]   This is the tagline of James, right?
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:48.920]   That faith is going to be tested in trial, which causes maturity, completion, and perfection.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.680]   And that's the cycle we're living in.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.560]   In college, many times, you come to college and you realize for the first time, like,
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.120]   "Ooh, maybe I just became saved," you know?
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.440]   For the first time, you're taking your faith seriously.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.440]   For the first time, you've actually surrendered your life to Christ.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.400]   And so you're looking at yourself and you have never felt like this.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.480]   Like, I wake up and I want to read the Word.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.560]   I am excited about Sundays.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.800]   I listen to the sermon and I'm like doing this.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   Like, I am evangelizing.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.960]   So you see all these things and then you become like someone who is like, "Faith, yes.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.800]   True faith, yes."
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.880]   But from there, it's like, "How does that translate into am I ready to date?"
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.200]   So where I'm trying to go with this is the only way to see if that is not just an initial
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.640]   surge of just like, "Whoa."
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.040]   Like, you know, you could be learning so much and be stale in your heart.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.480]   You could be learning so much about who God is and what His kingdom is like and the promises
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.720]   that He makes and the attributes of what He is and then the theologies and the doctrines
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.720]   of NBCC.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.800]   And you could do all of that stuff and you could be fooled in it.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.840]   But the only time you're going to know that it's real and it begins to surface as reality
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.960]   and truth in your heart is when the storm hits.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.240]   And then it actually gets tested.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.400]   And then you say, "I believe that God is so good.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   He is the goodest person in my life."
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.600]   And then the storm hits you, "Where's God?"
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.440]   And then someone that comes out of that, you know what I call that person, is someone who
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.360]   has matured.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.800]   That's why I say pump the brakes.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.320]   Give it as much time as possible because you might see someone and say like, "Oh man, Pastor
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.320]   Nate, that person is ready to date.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.320]   I want to date that person."
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:54.240]   And I say like, "Hey, but just general advice at this stage in life where you guys are both
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:00.160]   very young in faith, give it as much time as possible because a storm might hit her
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.920]   and then after like eight months later, you might be like, "Whoa, dude, she should not
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.680]   be dating right now."
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.560]   So what's the difference between time A and time B is going to be that a storm hit and
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.720]   it actually revealed true faith and character and maturity.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.720]   Same thing for you.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.360]   I say wait as long as you possibly can because as you do that, you're going to be tested
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   in yourself.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.040]   You think that you have a lot of stuff grounded and you're like, "Man, I think I am ready."
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.600]   But maybe if you give it just two more months, a tragedy is going to hit and you're going
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.040]   to realize, "Oh man, I am in no way ready."
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.460]   I am not saying that you're going to be perfect before you date or perfect before you marry,
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.080]   but I think we ought to put that into the equation.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.560]   Okay.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.560]   Oh, another poll.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.800]   How long do you want to date?
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   And then let's do that one first.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.920]   Go back into your phones and then you guys can answer this one.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   Come on, don't waste the space on those.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   That was a fake one.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:12.920]   You guys know it.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:21.160]   Okay.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.280]   How long do you want to date for?
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.560]   Well, a lot of people say two years, maybe three years, three plus years.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.560]   Okay.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.120]   And then one year, six months.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.120]   And this changes.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:38.240]   Once you graduate and you go into BAM and stuff, and we did this poll in BAM, it'd be
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.240]   way different.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:45.200]   And so with this, what's interesting is like, is this, like, does this play a role at all
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.840]   in thinking how about when you might want to date?
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.840]   Here's another question.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   What age would you like to marry?
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.320]   Oh, boy.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.320]   Same person.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.320]   All right.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.320]   Oh, 30 plus.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:09.320]   Is that for real or is that a joke one?
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   I mean, it's fine.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.800]   30 plus is good.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.880]   No, seriously.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.520]   Why are you guys laughing?
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.880]   You guys are such college students.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.880]   That's why.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.880]   Okay.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.440]   Think about it.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.920]   Like the one before you look at it and you're like, okay, here it is.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.280]   I want to date like this.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:40.320]   So for those of you who put two years and then you put 25 to 27, you're like, this is
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.320]   interesting.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.320]   We have all these stuff.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.720]   I'm not saying that, of course, but the first person I date might not be the person I need
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.720]   to have a little buffer room.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.720]   You know, like that's how we think.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.400]   But what I'm trying to say is do you kind of think soberly through it or is it like
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.040]   you just find someone that's like a potential and you're like, oh, I got to be all over
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.240]   this one, right?
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.600]   Marshall Siegel says, some no doubt will hate this advice.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.200]   I'm sure I would have.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.720]   Now, I don't -- this is not exactly what I believe.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.920]   I'm just going to put it out there, okay?
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.880]   I'm sure I would have, but we all need to acknowledge that we can date long before we
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.880]   can marry.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.120]   And that doesn't mean we should.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.840]   We cannot date toward marriage when marriage isn't even on the radar yet.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.920]   You may be dreaming about marriage already.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.920]   I was.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.200]   But is it realistic that the two of you can marry anytime soon?
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.640]   So this isn't -- what he's doing is he's pulling out a question.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.920]   So what he's -- what I'm trying not -- I'm trying not to say right now that we -- like
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.400]   you need to only date when you're like completely ready to be married.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   That's not what I'm trying to say.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.200]   That everything is perfect, that everything is planned out.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.640]   But what I am saying is there needs to be some semblance of that.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.960]   If you're thinking like I want to date two years and then I want to get married a year
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.640]   after that, or I want to date three years and now I want to get married -- you know,
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.440]   as you're thinking about these things, like you're like, but I haven't declared my major
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.440]   yet.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.560]   It's like, okay.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.600]   I would say, wait.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.080]   You'll find someone else.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.120]   Yeah, someone else might date that person, but it's okay.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.120]   They're not yours.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   That's your sister.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.120]   That's your brother.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.880]   Like get to a place where you're a little bit closer to it, to a place where you can
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.480]   actually provide for a family or be self-sustaining and you're not living in your parents' house
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.480]   anymore or something.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.840]   You know, something.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.160]   You got to figure out what that semblance is.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160]   You know, there are a bunch of questions that might come out too, right?
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160]   Or there, I didn't realize I had it.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   Consider life after college.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.920]   You know, because what happens is, like you start dating in college and what tends to
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:59.600]   happen is as the end of fourth year rolls around, everyone starts saying, uh-oh.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.840]   I'm going to New York now, you know?
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.280]   Or I'm going back to NorCal, but you're in SoCal.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:12.080]   Or I have, I just realized my last year that I want to go into med school.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.600]   That's going to be another six years before I want to actually marry.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.440]   Or, you know, there's lots of different things that come up and then all of a sudden you
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.280]   have two people that were just dating and just thinking like very like, like living
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.600]   in, they were living in like fantasy land.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.200]   Just ideally like, oh, we're just trying to honor God without thinking about the wise
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   implications.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.160]   Am I actually ready?
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.800]   You have, the key word consider, it's not saying like this is it, you know?
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.520]   I'm saying consider it.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.520]   Think about it.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.840]   You have two people undeclared.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.760]   They have no idea where they want to go.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.400]   It's like, but all I know personally is that I have her, you know?
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.760]   It's like, no, dude, you fool, you know?
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.520]   It's, it's, you, you look at that and you have to be temperate about it.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.760]   You have to be sober about it.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.400]   You have to think like, you know, I'm nowhere near ready.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.640]   I got to fix a lot of stuff in my own heart.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.720]   I got to figure out a lot of things in my own life.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.280]   And when I'm closer to them, then maybe I can start like, you know, thinking, thinking
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.320]   about like walking together with someone in this.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.320]   It's hard.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:27.760]   I have, I have counseled many, many people who have like gone through different things
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.320]   and like, like in dating.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.720]   And this is probably the one that kind of comes up very, very often because I, I spent
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.360]   so much time with like a youth aged group who, who grew up into a certain age range.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.560]   So like, that's like, that was a lot of, of what, what I did.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.160]   Like these people would contact me and say like, "Hey, can I get your quick advice?"
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.360]   And I'd listen and be like, "Oh man, you, your, your path is complete.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.800]   You guys realize that you want to, you want to be a missionary in Africa and that you
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.800]   realize you want to just go back and, you know, work in an office job."
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.280]   All this stuff kind of happens.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:06.920]   And if you knew that before, maybe you wouldn't even have started dating that person.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.240]   Determining the relationship in clarity.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.720]   So you asked yourself, "Am I ready?"
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.280]   And then you got the answer you wanted.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.040]   "Yes, I'm ready."
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.880]   Then this is where the DTRA happens.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.200]   Determining the relationship in clarity.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   Be clear.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.200]   Same thing as the title.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.200]   Be clear.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:35.520]   Be clear.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.520]   Don't let it just happen as, as much as possible.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.960]   I, I, I made a mistake with this with Kezia.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.200]   Like Kezia and I, we had no feelings for each other in college.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   All four years.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.360]   And then we spent a year and a half away from each other, like in different places.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.400]   And then she moved into my area.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.920]   And then, and then literally, there was no feelings for each other.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.480]   We're just really good friends.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.720]   And then in August, we started spending time with each other, with a group of people.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.600]   And then two months later, like we were determining the relationship.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.160]   We were DTRAing.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.160]   Right?
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.160]   But I was, I was backed into a corner.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.160]   Because it happened so fast.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.160]   I was like, "What am I feeling?"
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.160]   You know?
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.160]   Like, "What is this?"
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.160]   But it's Kezia.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.160]   "Ew, gross."
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.160]   You know?
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.960]   It's that kind of thing.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.440]   And then we were like brother/sisters.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.680]   That's why.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.200]   And then you realize like, like, and then Kezia called me one day.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   She's like, "Hey, what's going on?"
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   You know?
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.200]   And I was like, "I don't know."
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   You know?
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   But be clear.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   That's what you want.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.440]   You want to be as clear as possible.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.640]   Don't like, don't just like, you know, like you guys are in the middle of a talk and all
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.760]   of a sudden, like in a moment of weakness, you go like, "Hey, I kind of have feelings
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.760]   for you."
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.760]   You know?
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:40.760]   "Oh, damn.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.760]   I can't take this back."
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.760]   But your heart is thumping.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.760]   You're like, "This is exciting."
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.760]   You know?
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.760]   Don't, don't do that.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.480]   Don't go up to someone and say, "Hey, I kind of like you."
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   You know that kind of thing?
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.480]   Don't, don't do that.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.600]   Don't do that.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.760]   Think about it.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.760]   Have a game plan.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.760]   Make it clear.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.760]   Don't play games.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.600]   Don't, don't go for months just playing games and like, and like thinking like, "Oh, if
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.120]   I do this, they're going to know that I'm interested.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.840]   And then like if I do this, she's going to, she's going to like, like I'm going to give
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.720]   her a hint here and then a hint here and then a hint here and then a hint here.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.440]   And hopefully like, like he's going to come and he's going to ask me, you know, or, or
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   vice versa.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.440]   Right?
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.440]   Don't do that.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.840]   Don't play games.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.320]   I'm not saying you can't show interest in people, you know, like, like don't also go
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.320]   the opposite way.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.440]   I've seen people like try to pendulum swing that the other way.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.560]   And then whenever that person comes in, they go, "Huh."
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.040]   And they walk out, you know, because they're in love with the person, you know, that kind
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.960]   of thing.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.120]   But you want to be clear.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.360]   If you have interest in a person, and this is where this comes in.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.680]   Generally, generally, asterisk, asterisk, generally men step up.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:59.720]   And remember, this is with all the backing of like, hey, get prepared for dating first.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.120]   So for many of you, you might not be anywhere near this yet.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.120]   Okay.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.600]   So don't think like, "Oh, now this is the stuff where I need to start.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.600]   Like this is what I'm going to apply."
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.960]   You know.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.960]   Generally men step up.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.960]   Don't play games.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.600]   If you have, if you have interest, just make it clear.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.960]   You know, say like, "Hey, I'm interested."
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.960]   We don't have to make it weird.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.760]   We don't have to be like, "Hey, I'm serious about wanting to marry you."
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   You know, don't do that.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.000]   Just go and say like, "There's interest here.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.920]   And you know, like, would you like to go get a coffee or whatever it is."
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.480]   You've done all the due diligence.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.000]   You've received the counsel.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.840]   You've done, you know, and generally people are like, "Yeah, I guess, yeah, you know,
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.840]   you're doing great."
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.680]   And then go and don't play the games.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.880]   A lot of times people play these games without any intention of ever like, like pursuing
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.880]   a relationship because we're just passive timid people.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.880]   We like them so like, we'll like say things or act a certain way in front of them but
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.840]   we actually don't ever think it's going to get to that point where we're going to ask
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.200]   until like finally like you hit the breaking point.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.680]   But you should be, you should be walking way ahead of that breaking point.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:14.080]   Let's see here.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:20.560]   Yeah, so in not playing games, treat them like a brother or sister, right?
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.800]   You want to, that's, you want to do that.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   So just, they're not your wife, they're not your husband, they're not the person you're
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   going to marry.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.360]   They're just someone you're interested in.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.000]   So like treat them as someone that they are.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.840]   That's your brother, that's your sister.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.480]   And if you're interested in just make it clear.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.800]   If you guys have questions about this, by the way at any point you can text me.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:49.960]   If you want my phone number I'll put it up at the end and then you can, you can do the
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.560]   questions for the Q&A time.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.160]   All right, prepare for frustrations and heartaches.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.520]   The men don't let the risk of rejection paralyze you.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.920]   The women learn to trust.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:09.760]   And I don't know if some of you see this and you're like, "Oh, but you know, like this
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.760]   isn't..."
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:17.480]   Generally, I'm not saying that women can't, you know, ask a guy out.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.320]   I'm not saying like they can't initiate the DTRing.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:26.840]   But generally men, I would, I would like to see you as what God has made men to be as
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.560]   initiators, as people who are going to be strong and bold and not passive.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.360]   Isn't that what girls want anyway?
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:38.640]   Don't you want like someone who's assertive and knows like that, that they love God and
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.640]   that's what they live for?
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.640]   Like that's what you would want.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.960]   Someone who's clear and don't, don't let...
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.960]   This is going to happen.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.160]   As you go through this over and over again, you're going to have this risk of rejection.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.400]   But what if like I say like, "Hey, I'm interested in you and I would like to get some coffee."
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.560]   And they look at you and they start laughing.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.000]   It's like the stuff of nightmares, you know.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Don't let that stop you.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Be like, "Oh, okay, okay.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Who are you?"
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Ari.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Let's walk away.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   All right.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.440]   And then women learn to trust.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.640]   This is hard because sometimes you're interested in a guy and you're like, "Why is everybody
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:14.000]   that I'm not interested in asking me out and this guy that I am interested in?"
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.320]   Well, learn to trust.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.600]   This one, maybe one day we could do like, when we do like a men's and women's seminar
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.800]   roles, things like that.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.040]   I would like a female to be up here talking to you guys.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.400]   I'm not going to say it because I think I can do some damage right now because we don't
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.880]   have time to clearly go through this.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:37.560]   So with that said, we're going to move on here.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.000]   It can get messy and that's okay.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.440]   Sometimes you're going to make mistakes but just get back on track.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.080]   It's okay.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.440]   There's a place--this is a place of grace.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.560]   I want to use this time to kind of challenge you guys.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:55.240]   If there are people that you think didn't make the right decisions, you should not be
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.760]   like all judgmental and hoity-toity about it, you know.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.000]   You should be like, "Oh, I can't believe you did that, man," or "I can't believe you did
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   that," you know.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Like, don't do that.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.640]   Don't do that, okay?
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.640]   That's wrong.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:12.520]   Like you might think it's funny and it's innocent but sometimes it's very, very damaging.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.880]   We are not here to build up a culture of like, "I'm right.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.960]   I know more than you.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.960]   You didn't do it."
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.240]   Even if you feel like you did the right thing, if someone else maybe made a questionable
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.520]   call, you don't turn to them and go like, "Huh."
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.400]   And then because of that judgment that you have in your heart, it just comes out of sarcasm
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.840]   and like poking fun and stuff.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.920]   And really, really, like don't do that.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.480]   And so there's a lot of places where it's going to get messy and that's okay.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   There's my phone number.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.480]   Okay.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:46.360]   I know you didn't get that but it's okay.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.360]   Potential dangers within dating.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.360]   I'll put that up again at the end.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.360]   All right.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.920]   So who are dating now?
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.800]   Acting married versus acting casual.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   Oops.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.240]   Acting married versus casual.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.720]   Now in this section, we're in section four.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.160]   With these potential dangers, you're going to see both of these.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.680]   You're going to see people acting like married couples.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.200]   Don't do that.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:16.440]   This is why dating is hard because it's a kind of a commitment with no real commitment.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.000]   You guys know what I'm saying?
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.800]   You're kind of committing to each other to be in this relationship but there's no actual
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.800]   commitment.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   You guys can back out and that's okay.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:32.160]   And so dating is hard because once you start acting married, then it gets really, really
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:39.800]   confusing and it gets really, really kind of twisted up and like I've seen it.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:45.360]   People start to break up and then it feels like a divorce and it's so hard because maybe
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.600]   there are certain things that you have crossed in terms of emotional boundaries and that's
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.600]   what we'll talk about here.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.560]   Oh, I just did the casual part, huh?
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.480]   Too casual.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.800]   Don't also treat it like it's not a special relationship.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.480]   Essentially like what I mean by that is that you're just friends and there's no real intentionality
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:12.320]   in moving towards marriage but you guys are just kind of going on dates and hanging out.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.320]   There's no clarity.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.320]   There's no communication.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.320]   You need to be on the same page.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.680]   All right.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.440]   Secondly, B, boundless boundaries.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.440]   This is a danger.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.960]   We all know that we should set boundaries but many times we set boundaries that are
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.960]   boundless.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:34.280]   Physical, emotional, mental, spiritual.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:40.160]   The whole goal in boundaries is to guard your relationship with God.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.080]   This is first and foremost because we obviously know we're trying to guard ourselves.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.160]   Usually what happens in boundaries is we're trying to guard ourself and then we're trying
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.000]   to guard the other person and then we're trying to guard our relationship with God.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.280]   That's how we naturally think but that's completely flipped upside down.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.280]   You should be thinking about guarding your relationship with God, his glory, the fact
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:08.160]   that your life is about him, that you don't want anything to come in between you and Christ.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.960]   And then the second one is you also want to guard them.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:18.520]   And then thirdly and lastly, like you come last, you know.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.640]   So in boundaries, oh, Addy's favorite movie right now.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.640]   She's watched one movie.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.760]   Christian dating, you better not get in the way of me loving Jesus.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.760]   All right.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.760]   B, specific.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:35.000]   Be specific in boundary building.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.600]   Don't let it be based on simply like your temptations and struggles, like your own temptations
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.280]   and struggles, I'm going to build my boundaries around this.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:50.240]   But constantly be thinking like how can we be sure that we're not going to cross lines
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.120]   that would be dishonoring to God.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:58.880]   And we'll go into that in a little bit more depth soon.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.880]   And physical intimacy.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.680]   Here's the wrong question.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.440]   How far can I go before it's soon?
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.760]   And people don't phrase it like this but people phrase it like, "Astronethan, can I like,
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.760]   is it okay to like hold hands?
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.760]   Is it okay to kiss?"
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.160]   You know, like those are the actual questions that kind of come up.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.040]   I'd say that's the wrong question.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.400]   I won't, I'll try not to answer those questions.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:23.160]   The way that you should be asking the question, how best can I go if I got?
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:28.800]   They're very different because one is going to be honestly in our sinfulness of heart,
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.720]   it's going to be how, like literally how far can I go up against that line before like
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.000]   this is wrong.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   That is not how a Christian thinks.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   That's how a legalist thinks.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.080]   For a Christian, we say like how, like in this whole scheme of things, if I wanted to
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.040]   be all about God, and we say that with our lips, but for real, if I wanted to be all
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.040]   about God, how can I do this?
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:56.600]   I thought this was funny.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.200]   When my body doesn't know I'm Christian.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.320]   So we're talking about physical intimacy here, right?
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.640]   You guys don't think it's funny?
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:09.560]   I try to add a few things that would like soften it up here, but so we're going to have
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.560]   to talk about that, right?
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:17.560]   With physical intimacy, kissing, holding hands, how far can I go in these things?
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.600]   I'm just going to explain to you how Kazee and I did it, okay?
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:26.520]   And the reason why I'm explaining to you guys with our example is because I am not saying
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.760]   this is the way to do it.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:36.240]   I am simply giving you how we sat down and said, how are we going to guard this relationship
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.040]   and make sure that it is glorifying to God, make sure we don't cross things that we definitely
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.640]   don't want to cross up front.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.680]   So we didn't kiss until the altar.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.320]   At the altar, it was super awkward, but at the altar is when we shared our first kiss.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:56.120]   I never said I love you to Kazee until I like I proposed to her.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.680]   And I'm not saying that's the way to do it.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   You guys caught that, right?
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.720]   Please don't go and say, "Do Pastor Nathan said you can't kiss until the altar."
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.360]   But for us, we sat down and we said, "What do we want to do?"
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.640]   Knowing you, knowing me, knowing our hearts, knowing our sinful tendency, knowing all of
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:19.840]   this stuff about us, how can I really, how can we really think through this?
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:25.000]   There are different things that we thought about, like I don't want to be kissing some
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.800]   other man's wife one day.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.800]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   Oh, wait, hold on.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:37.400]   I don't want to be kissing a girl that's going to one day be someone else's wife.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.440]   Like kissing, did I say that off again?
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.040]   Did I say it weird again?
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.040]   Dang it, sorry.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.280]   You guys know what I'm saying, right?
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:50.920]   You don't want to be sharing certain things with someone that, at the end of the day,
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:57.000]   when you talk to your future husband or wife, you're like, "Oh, yeah, I kissed three other
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.520]   people," or something like that.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.320]   So for us, that's why we decided to do that.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:06.880]   I said, "I don't want to be kissing anyone that's not my wife.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:14.320]   I don't want to be in church having dated someone and then having gone a little bit
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.840]   too far physically with this person, and then later on in life, they end up marrying someone
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:26.520]   else and then you pass by them and you're like, "Oh, this is weird still."
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.680]   And we don't think about that.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.760]   We think about it in the here and now and what we want and how we would think relationships
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.760]   ought to look.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.800]   But who's informing you about how relationships ought to look?
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.040]   Why do you think holding hands is okay even?
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.080]   You know, like why any of this stuff?
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.680]   At what point, like, can we start distinguishing and drawing lines?
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:55.240]   That's why the question has to be, "How can I make sure that I'm guarding my relationship
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   with God?
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.800]   How can I best glorify God in my relationship with this person?"
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.240]   Physical intimacy needs to be surrounded around that.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.000]   That's why when people come and say like, "Hey, tell me the boundaries I need to set."
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   I say, "I can't tell you.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.640]   I'll give you some examples of things that you can think about, but at the end of the
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.880]   day, it's about your heart in this."
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.560]   And so, honestly speaking, I shouldn't say it.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.920]   So we'll move on from there.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.080]   So some things might seem innocent, but I want to remind you guys not to fool yourselves
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   in it.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.080]   Did I not have these Proverbs?
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.080]   I don't have it.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.080]   Okay.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.080]   That's okay.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:39.440]   Well, we'll get to those.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:43.720]   In Proverbs chapter five verse eight and in Proverbs chapter six, you get this kind of
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:51.120]   like this Proverbs story about this man who keeps going past this house of a known prostitute.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.120]   And so he's like, maybe he's going to work or whatever.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:58.560]   And then what the Proverbs says is, "Make sure you don't go anywhere near the door of
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.560]   the house."
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.800]   The way we live is actually it's like, "Make sure we don't go through the door of that
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   house."
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   That's how we live.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.880]   But the Proverbs says, "Make sure to go nowhere near the door of that house."
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:15.560]   And so the idea of it is like, if there's my work and here's that house, like this is
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.760]   my way to work and every day, like first day I'm good.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.920]   Second day, like I'm still resisting temptation.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.920]   It's kind of like that.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.920]   What he's saying, don't go anywhere near it.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:30.000]   He's saying, go all the way around the room and take the back door into that work building.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   That's what it's saying.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.760]   This is how carefully you ought to guard your heart when it comes to physical intimacy and
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.760]   things like that.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.680]   In Proverbs 6, it says something along the lines of, "Can someone play with coals, live
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.680]   coals?
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.360]   Can someone play with fire and not be burned?"
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:52.480]   Like in relationships, when it gets too physical, like, well, I don't, like we feel like our
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.840]   conscience is clear, Pastor Nate.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   Our conscience is clear.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.440]   They say like, "Oh, you're playing with fire.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.680]   You're going to get burned."
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:04.240]   Only a matter of time.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:11.600]   Probably like over 95% of like couples that I've seen at a young age, like once they've
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.640]   crossed boundaries, were able to like really, you know, do well.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.240]   It's really hard in physical boundaries.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.960]   All right.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.040]   Also emotional intimacy.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:32.160]   Don't let it feel like a marriage.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:38.040]   Like if holding hands, if you're spending too much time and you really start feeling
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:44.080]   this closeness with the person that is unhealthy, that shouldn't be given, like we think of
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:49.560]   physical intimacy all the time, but you can emotionally give yourself to people.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:54.640]   And so if you feel that happening, then you ought to be aware of that.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.320]   If it starts feeling like a marriage, so people start doing that, right?
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.080]   Like start sending Christmas cards out together.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.440]   Like, "Oh, okay.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.440]   Weird."
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.720]   Like when you go to weddings, like don't buy gifts together, just you and your girlfriend
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.720]   or you and your boyfriend.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.960]   It's like, "Why are you doing that?"
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.800]   You know?
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.160]   Try not to let it feel like a marriage.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.600]   I saw that in high school a lot.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.600]   Like it was weird.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.200]   I thought it was funny at first, and then I was like, "Ooh, this is weird."
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.200]   You know?
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.440]   It's just like when people were asking each other out, they were like proposing to each
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.440]   other and stuff.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.440]   That's strange.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.040]   And then one of my former students, they did like a photo shoot, and I was like, "Dude,
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.280]   this is like an engagement photo shoot that they're doing.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.280]   What is going on?"
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.280]   And then lo and behold, you know what happens?
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.840]   The whole like, "Oh, we were slow dancing at this thing, and then we just like fell
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.840]   in love," as Nathan.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:44.840]   You know?
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:49.200]   It's like, "Well, you guys were doing all the things before that, and so what did you
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.200]   expect?"
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   You know?
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:58.880]   And then inevitably, the post-dance craze kind of like dissipates, and then they get
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.880]   a divorce.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.880]   You know?
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.880]   And they're just crying all the time.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.880]   Breaks up the entire youth group, and you're just like, "Oh, brother."
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.880]   You know?
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.880]   It's ridiculous.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.760]   Don't let it feel like a marriage.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.320]   You don't own them.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.900]   They're not yours.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:21.500]   The person talks to them, and all of a sudden, just the ferocious, jealous monster comes
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:26.020]   out and wants to scream like a banshee because like this person is talking to your boyfriend
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.020]   or girlfriend.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.820]   You're like, "Dude, what is wrong with you?"
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:30.820]   You know?
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:35.980]   Like when you're sharing that person's time, that person is spending time in school and
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:41.340]   in their small group and like in a job, and you're like, "But where's the time for me?"
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:45.420]   Yeah, you guys have to work that out, but remember, that person does not belong to you.
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.900]   These things are very difficult and stuff to work through, and if you guys have questions
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.100]   about those things, you can talk to your small group leaders.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:58.740]   You can talk to the staff.
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:03.220]   What does it mean when you say--what is love?
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:09.500]   When a boy says to a girl or a girl says to a boy, "I love you," what is that?
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:15.300]   I want to strongly encourage you guys not to throw around that phrase if you start dating.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:20.140]   Because love is actually--has everything to do--like if we're called to love as Christ
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:23.420]   first love does, it has everything to do with commitment.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.300]   You are not sure yet if you're actually fully committing to that person, but we throw it
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.980]   around because we want to make our feelings felt by that person.
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:31.980]   So we say, "I love you."
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:32.980]   And you go, "I don't love you yet."
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:33.980]   You know?
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:34.980]   That kind of thing.
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:35.980]   But be careful of that.
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:47.980]   In terms of emotional boundaries, be careful of curfew.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.660]   Like the reason why curfew is important is because late at night is when your guard is
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:52.660]   most down.
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.500]   Like I don't care what you say.
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.660]   I don't care if you say like, "You have no proof of this, Pastor Nathan."
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:03.340]   I've just seen enough and I know enough that late at night, people do dumb things.
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:09.340]   People are just emotionally more vulnerable.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:14.380]   And so like if you're dating, that's why curfew is important.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.260]   Set curfew and stick to it.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.900]   Like don't be like, "Oh, well, we just broke it by five minutes today."
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.900]   Like it's okay.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.900]   It is okay.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:25.660]   You know, it's like came home at 11.05.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:30.300]   But what I'm saying is like what tends to happen is people set like curfews and like
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.860]   these emotional boundaries and stuff, but they'll come up to that time where it's like
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.860]   10.50.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.860]   It's like, "Oh, it's not 11 o'clock yet."
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.860]   10.55, "Oh, it's not 11 o'clock yet."
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:43.460]   It's like 11 o'clock, they're like, "Oh, dang, we have a 20-minute ride home."
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.020]   And so boundaries, that's why I label it boundless boundaries.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.020]   Like if you set a boundary, stick to the boundary.
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.420]   Like if you know it's going to take 20 minutes to get home, then that needs to be a part
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.340]   of the equation.
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.860]   This is all, I say, very important in relationships.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.860]   Length of phone conversations.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:04.140]   I've heard of stories about where people would be like, "We don't get to hang out that much,
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.740]   so we'll use the phone conversation."
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:10.260]   So you're laying in bed with the phone on your face, and then it sticks to your ear
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.260]   and stuff like that.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:15.540]   And then you fall asleep on the phone.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.540]   There's a whole joke of like, "Oh, you hang up.
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:18.540]   No, you hang up."
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.540]   That kind of thing back and forth.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.540]   And don't do that.
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:21.540]   Do that.
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:22.540]   That's gross.
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:30.380]   Just set a time limit and be like, "Hey, this is what happened."
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:36.380]   Enjoy the time and then say like, "Hey, let's hang up."
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.380]   Okay.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.380]   I'm getting tired.
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.380]   All right, warning signs.
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.380]   Obsession.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:48.900]   If you see any of these in the other person or in yourself, this is like, "Meh, meh, meh."
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:55.380]   If you see obsessive stuff going on, if they're trying to manipulate you with their words
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:37:00.180]   and trying to make you feel guilty, if there's abuse, and obviously that's not just physical,
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.460]   it's the words they use.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:06.260]   If you see any of these things, you know, first of all, that at least that person has
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.300]   crossed an emotional boundary.
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.940]   Or if it's you, maybe you actually have.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:17.460]   And you have to kind of pause, evaluate it, maybe break up, or maybe get some counsel
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.500]   and work through it.
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:24.260]   All right, mental fantasy.
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.260]   Thinking and planning ahead.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.740]   A lot of times we can start dating and think like, "Oh, this is how it's going to look."
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.420]   And we have our whole life mapped out until the day we die.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.020]   Well, don't do that.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.300]   Because when you start doing that, you start actually getting married in your mind and
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:41.300]   then it gets hard.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.380]   Compromising is the road to destruction when it comes to boundaries.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:46.020]   Don't compromise.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.380]   Boundaries mean stick to them.
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:52.300]   If you break them, it doesn't mean shift the boundaries out more, like say like to accommodate
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:56.940]   what we broke, but it should mean like we really have to buckle down on our boundaries.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.460]   And every once in a while, what you do is you kind of reevaluate boundaries and see
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.740]   if it's still helpful for you.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.380]   Because boundaries are to help you, not like hurt you.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.500]   Oh, here it is.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.500]   Those are the passages.
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.500]   Okay.
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.580]   Oh, I thought this was funny.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.740]   I was standing behind Nick and Alisa the other day and I thought it was so funny because
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:22.500]   yeah, Nick was standing here.
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:27.140]   That's right around like where Mina and I think it was where Mina and Brianna are sitting
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.860]   and then they had like a space between them with a cell phone there.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:32.060]   I thought it was just so hilarious.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.060]   Like boundaries.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.700]   Okay.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.300]   Stewardship of existing friendships.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:43.220]   Oh, steward your existing friendships well.
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.220]   Don't be the couple that bounces.
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:49.260]   You know, don't be the couple that disappears, that hangs out by themselves all the time.
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.300]   That is so selfish.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.500]   That is not what that relationship for.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:58.980]   If anything, that relationship should be used to come into the body and serve more and things
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:38:59.980]   like that.
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:00.980]   So don't disappear.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:06.180]   I know sometimes you want alone time with them and constructively you can do that, but
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:13.940]   make sure that that is not how everything is.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:21.060]   Oh, with that, I guess beware of the awkwardness that comes.
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:25.260]   Like we're a ministry and there's going to be awkwardness when two people start dating
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:29.460]   because it changes the dynamic of relationships that already exist.
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.460]   It's okay.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.460]   That's okay.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.880]   That's going to happen.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.540]   But I would say as much as possible, if you are the non-dating people and then people
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:43.100]   start dating and like, oh, like we used to hang out with them and then it's kind of like
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:48.460]   this and then like, but now like we don't know how to, like as a non-dating person,
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:49.780]   don't make it awkward for them.
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.180]   You know, don't like always be making fun of them and things like that.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.940]   I like to make fun of people because it's just how I show my care.
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:02.320]   But generally, like what you want to do is be encouraging of them.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:07.200]   Like ask them, like how's your relationship going and things like that.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.240]   Don't shun them because like it could become a two-front battle.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:15.880]   And then if you're the dating couple, really together insert yourself into the life of
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.440]   existing relationships and groups that are here.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.240]   So I don't want like you to like always be sitting with your boyfriend/girlfriend, but
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:29.200]   I also don't want you guys to always be separate, you know.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.360]   Play a good balance in that.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:37.360]   I would say bend towards spending more time away from each other in group settings, bend
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.760]   towards that.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.360]   But if you guys are never interacting with each other, you'll never figure out how to
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.440]   like, you know, exist as a couple.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.520]   And secrecy.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.420]   Don't be secretive.
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:55.680]   That means tell your small group leader who you like.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.060]   Practical applications while dating.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.640]   This is our last section.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:03.840]   Always pursue godly contentment.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.440]   Always pursue godly contentment.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.920]   If this is not the source, then you'll use the relationship to fill an idolatrous need
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:10.920]   in your heart.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.920]   We've covered this.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.920]   So beware of being consumed with finding someone.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.400]   Beware of constantly scoping, that wherever you go you're constantly looking for like
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.400]   an attractive person.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.600]   Careful of that.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.640]   Instead really try to make Christ-centered relationships here in this ministry.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.320]   Beware of making lists in your mind or actual physical lists.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   I know people do that.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.000]   Like what's the deal breaker, you know, and all that kind of stuff.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.520]   Beware of these kinds of things.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:43.080]   Trust in God's sovereignty and timing.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.160]   Proverbs 3, 5-6 says, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.160]   own understanding.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.520]   In all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your path straight."
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:56.040]   I think like as a practical application verse, I have probably recited this to myself more
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.000]   than any other verse in scripture personally.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.280]   To really trust in him.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:06.400]   Maybe before you're dating and also while you're dating.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.240]   Trust.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.640]   All relationships aren't going to look the same.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.200]   But there are going to be times where you think like, "Oh, this is the one I'm going
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.200]   to marry."
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.680]   There's going to be times where you think there's no one going to be like her.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.800]   There's no one going to be like him.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.680]   But like calm down.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   Trust in God.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.360]   Do you really believe that God is sovereign?
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.680]   Then you're okay.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.000]   Like if you feel that, there's no one that's going to be like this person.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.680]   This person is so solid.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:39.480]   You think that as soon as you say that, what you've done is you've erected an idol, right?
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.960]   That's clearly an idol.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.680]   And you haven't even recognized it.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.080]   You're like, "Oh, this is dangerous."
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.600]   Letter C, treat the relationship as what it truly is.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.960]   I wanted to say this one again.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:58.160]   You're not married, so don't do married couple of things.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:03.400]   Learn to grow in the relationship.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.960]   Clearly communicate and temper expectations.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.760]   Even though we're saying that this isn't a marriage relationship, understand that like
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.320]   there still needs to be movement.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.360]   If there's no movement, it's like what is the purpose of it?
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:18.120]   Just wait then, you know?
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.520]   So clearly communicate, temper expectations.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:26.120]   By communication, I'm talking about make sure you guys are on the same page.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:34.120]   Don't sit down at like the 10th date and be like, "Hey, I want to propose at month eight,
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.240]   and then I want us to get married at the year two mark."
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:43.480]   And it's not like that kind of stuff, but just to make sure like to sit down and talk
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.680]   through expectations together.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:51.400]   To be able to say it and then realize like, "Ooh, that's not a good expectation.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.680]   That's a sinful expectation."
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.840]   And kind of shaping that together and working together on that.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.880]   Every once in a while doing that is good.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.080]   Now I don't think you could do this one on your own.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.200]   I really don't think you could do this one on your own.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.360]   So what you need is someone older who knows you, who loves you and cares for you.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.280]   Go to them and ask them how to do this.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.080]   And then balance the act of growing and guarding.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.080]   This is the...
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.320]   If you could draw like two arrows that goes in a circle and a circle, growing, guarding,
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:22.680]   growing, guarding, is what you want in a dating relationship.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:29.720]   Constantly guarding yourself, but there is some kind of movement and growth in that relationship.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.920]   Guarding equals accountability and intentionality.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.440]   That means accountability with people that are around you.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.560]   So again, it could be a small group leader, but I think you should be talking to your
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.720]   small group too.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.520]   If you're a small group and you have a dating guy or a dating girl in that group, really
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.520]   like ask them those questions.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.920]   Like, "Hey, how's the relationship going?"
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.600]   And if you guys set up like, "Hey, can we hold you accountable to this?"
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:57.960]   And then like whatever that accountability thing is, regularly kind of go into that.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:01.560]   And then intentionality also means within the relationship.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.600]   Within the relationship, you're setting up the boundaries and being intentional in everything
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:10.320]   that you're doing.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.240]   Find good accountability and then learn from your own past.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.840]   So if you guys have had like a dating past and you guys have made mistakes, maybe if
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:24.560]   you even haven't dated, but you made mistakes in how you went about dealing with someone
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.600]   you liked, learn from it.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:32.120]   But also learn from the mistakes others have made.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.800]   Listen and really think like don't discount other people's experiences.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.000]   At the end of the day, that's what counseling kind of becomes.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.160]   Yeah, the word of God, but many people, the counsel comes through the word forged in the
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:49.280]   refining fire that happens in the person's heart and that comes down as experience.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.000]   And so learn from those things.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.080]   And then lastly, if you do break up, break up with the love for God and others.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:01.160]   Break up with the love for God and others.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:05.920]   That means if you break up, make sure that it doesn't divide God's people.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:11.640]   It doesn't make or create this unity amongst God's people.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:17.360]   You'll know, you'll know if you dated well by how you break up.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.600]   If you date really, really well, then you'll get married.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:25.520]   So yeah, here's some resources for you guys.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.400]   Kissing, there's a book called Boy Meets Girl.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.160]   Joshua Harris is the older one.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.440]   There's a companion book.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.720]   Well, this is the companion book.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:35.000]   The first one is I Kissed Dating Goodbye.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.720]   Now Joshua Harris later on came out and said like, "Oh, I wrote this when I was too young,"
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.720]   and stuff like that.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.720]   I agree.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.760]   He was really young when he wrote it, but I think there are a lot of good principles
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   in it.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.760]   So that's a good one.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.040]   Holding hands, holding hearts is like a personal favorite.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.360]   I think that's a must, holding hands, holding hearts.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.360]   Letters to a romantic.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.600]   Kezia showed me this one.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:58.120]   This one is like what I like to call like bathroom reading.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.320]   Now they're really short chapters.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.040]   And so Letters to a Romantic, and they're really good.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.780]   It just gives out like nuggets of gold.
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:07.040]   So I tried that one.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:12.360]   In marriage, This Momentary Marriage by John Piper, When Sinners Say I Do by Dave Harvey,
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.120]   that's a popular classic.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.320]   Meaning of Marriage by Tim Keller was good.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:22.200]   Marriage Wisely, Marriage, oh, Marry Wisely, Marry Well by Ernie Baker.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.240]   That one's a little bit more filled with scripture.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.520]   So if you want like a lot of scripture guidance, that's a good one.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:33.280]   For Men, Disciplines of a Godly Man, become a godly man before you date.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:38.060]   And then An Exemplary Husband, that one rocked me as a college student by Stuart Scott.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:41.760]   For Women, Excellent Wife, that's the companion book to Exemplary Husband.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.720]   That's by Martha Peace.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.160]   From what I hear, great book.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:49.760]   A Lies Woman Believe by Nancy DeMoss, and then Disciplines of a Godly Woman by Barbara
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.520]   Hughes.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.520]   So those are some books.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:56.960]   If you have any desire to just study more on your own and just think about things a
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.240]   little bit more, you guys can pick up some of those books.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:05.760]   So here is the Q&A.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:11.760]   And what we're going to do is I'm going to give you guys up until 4.30 to message me
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:16.800]   questions and/or go to the bathroom and get snacks and stuff, okay?
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.560]   And from 4.30 to 5, I'm going to cut it at 5 because I said 2 to 5.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.840]   We start at 2.25, so I'm just saying.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.840]   I'm doing a good job.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.440]   Tice, always on my case.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:33.400]   So go ahead and send me those and then you guys are kind of dismissed for the next seven
