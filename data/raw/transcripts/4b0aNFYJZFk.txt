[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   >> Well, good morning.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   If this is your first Sunday here with us,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   there is a welcome table outside in the back of the courtyard
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   where you can get more information.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   So please do stop by there.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And there are many things that you can learn about our church
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   just from just interacting with our welcome team.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   So please do go there if you're new.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   For you guys who are leading a home group,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   there's going to be a lunch for you at the cafe at 1 o'clock.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   I was asked to ask you to come on time for that
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   because the meeting's not going to last long.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   So if you're a home group lead, please do show up promptly at 1.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   A couple other announcements that we have is next Saturday at 10.30 here,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   the FAM 245, the more recently married couples,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   we're going to be having a little workshop seminar
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   on just kingdom-minded economics, wealth, stewardship, and poverty.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   And so if you were married after 2018
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   but you didn't get any kind of an email or invitation,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   go ahead and email me with any questions there.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Next Sunday, we do have a PTA--
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   well, it's not a PTA. It's a parents' meeting.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   So if you do drop off a child or a big child on Sunday
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   to any of our education ministry departments,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   this is going to be the only meeting for the year.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   So please do come here at 2.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   We're going to introduce you to the new teachers
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   and also just address some of the updates
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   and things that we have in store.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Also, the BBA is starting back up after about a--
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   like a two-year hiatus because of a global pandemic.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   We're going to do--the sign-ups are going to be taking place outside
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   between here and the cafe for you guys who are interested.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   You have to be a member or in the process of becoming a member
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   if you want to join.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And from what I understand, they're in the works
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   for trying to get a WBBA also for this year,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   but nothing's set yet.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   So if you are a woman baller and you want to participate,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   go make some noise, and then maybe something can get started.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   So just one last important announcement.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   You guys know that we've been having 2 p.m. classes for our church,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   like an equipping time through, like, the Bible--like a study lab
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   and the Old Testament survey.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   But this coming fall, we're going to start running--
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   trying to run 2 at a time.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   So the first one is going to be a theology class,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   4-week course taught by Elder James Hong,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   and the other one is going to be on spiritual growth
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   and sanctification taught by Pastor Mark.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   And I'm sure a lot of you want to take both,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   but we're going to try to have these running throughout the course
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   of the next several years.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   So if you miss one this time around, you can for sure take it again
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   or take it the following time.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   So please do sign up online for these things,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   and if you have any questions, just contact Elder James or Pastor Mark.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   We're going to take a time of offering, and physical offerings are--
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   you can drop it off in the back, or you can Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   as you would normally do.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   And after our time of praise, we're going to have our sister Tiffany
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   come up and share her testimony with you,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   and then you will all be here just to participate in her baptism.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   And so let me pray for the offering, and then we'll get--
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   we'll continue with our service.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Father, we thank you for just your daily provision,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   and we are here this morning just as a collective body
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   wanting to say thank you for your kindness, for your faithfulness.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   You are our audience this morning, and we pray that you would just engage
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   our hearts and remind us afresh of who it is that we worship,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   and the gifts that we bring.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Lord, help us to do so just with joy-filled hearts
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   as we are just returning to you the many blessings
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   that you've bestowed upon us in our lives.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   We love you, Lord, and we pray these things in Jesus' name.

[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:40.360]   - Hi, my name is Tiffany,
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.120]   and today I'll be sharing my testimony with you guys.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.960]   I grew up in an American Christian international school
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.960]   in China where I had the privilege to learn
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.960]   about Christ starting from a young age.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.360]   Memorizing scripture, hearing Bible stories,
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.260]   and singing children praise songs at school
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.380]   were routinely embedded into my weekly schedule.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.840]   I prayed to receive Christ as my Lord and Savior
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.200]   when I was seven.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.000]   I had a terrible fear of sharks
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.220]   after accidentally catching a glimpse of the movie "Jaws"
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.200]   at my cousin's house,
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.920]   and my parents shared the gospel with me
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.340]   one summer afternoon and told me the power Jesus has
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:19.560]   to quiet the seas and triumph over any evil spirit and demon.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.000]   Christ seemed real to me,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.220]   and I prayed to receive Christ that day in my life at home.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:27.400]   As a Taiwanese American at a school in China
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.760]   with predominantly Korean students,
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.400]   I was always a minority who wanted to fit in.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.600]   As a result, I frequently worked to draw attention to myself.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.900]   I lied to my peers and exaggerated my circumstances
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.420]   to receive praise and empathy from them.
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.740]   I have come to realize how foolish and futile
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.320]   my efforts were, because salvation is truly the work of God
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.560]   from beginning to end, separate from my works.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.280]   I loved Christ, yet he was not my greatest love.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.480]   I liked the idea of a Savior from my hellbound destiny,
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.500]   but there wasn't much surrender to him as my Lord.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.000]   In 2015, my family moved back to California.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.960]   Going into my sophomore year of high school,
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.180]   I found myself working to fit in once again.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.240]   Some of my friends struggled with depression
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.940]   and suicidal thoughts.
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.780]   I wrestled to understand why God would place such trials
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.160]   in people's lives.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.040]   My heart went out to them, and I desired to be a light,
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.180]   but my efforts were inherently selfish
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.480]   and ultimately ineffective,
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.160]   because I thought that I could save them.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.060]   And I felt guilty when I saw that I couldn't.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.920]   My bitterness also surfaced in having a bad attitude
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.720]   towards my parents, and in the midst of it all,
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.360]   I found myself face to face with my repeated sins
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.180]   of lying and working to gain the pity and approval of man.
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.920]   Even in the way I wrote my testimony,
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.100]   I highlighted instances that were self-glorifying.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.520]   In my mind, I said that Christ is enough for me,
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.840]   but in my heart, he felt so intangible.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.140]   Christ humbled me, reminding me he is the way,
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:58.280]   the truth, and the life, as he tells us in John 14, six.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.260]   Placing myself on a pedestal and giving myself the glory
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.000]   was only drawing my friends further away from Christ,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.520]   as I unintentionally encouraged them to find refuge
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.540]   in the brokenness of a fallen world,
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.740]   as I myself was also doing.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.900]   I got baptized by sprinkling on Easter in 2017
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.320]   with a desire to publicly proclaim
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.800]   and commit my faith in Christ.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.080]   A mentor convinced me to sign up for a discipleship course
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.800]   the summer after I graduated from high school.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.680]   For the first time, I truly understood
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.540]   how secular remedies are only band-aid fixes
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.360]   that never truly tackle the heart of the issue, sin.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.380]   I began to understand how no earthly person or thing
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.860]   can heal the void in people's hearts.
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.640]   Christ is the only one who can satisfy.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.420]   During the course, the pastor asked me
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.700]   how I thought God viewed me and where I would go
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.200]   if I died that day.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.000]   I knew the answer, but I surely did not feel it.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.360]   Years of feeling like I did not belong,
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.200]   coupled with the deceit I told both others and myself
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.220]   made me feel unworthy of his love.
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:01.880]   Through the mentor and his pastor's demonstration
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.200]   of Christ's love, I started to ask myself
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.900]   why I felt the need to chase after the approval of mankind.
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.180]   I came to a deeper understanding that salvation
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.660]   is truly by faith and faith alone.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.240]   God is working even when my heart may seem cold
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.000]   and he may seem distant.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.600]   In my first year of college, I joined a small group.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.240]   I started doing daily devotions and reading scripture
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.200]   for myself for the first time.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.720]   Rather than reading the Bible and memorizing verses
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.020]   for an A on an exam, his truth started transferring
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.280]   from head knowledge to heart knowledge.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.640]   I understood I cannot serve two gods at once
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:39.080]   by seeking the simultaneous approval of both God and man.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.680]   Matthew 16, 35 says, "For whoever would save his life
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.280]   "will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.400]   "will find it."
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.360]   I am called to deny myself and take up my cross daily
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.960]   and follow him.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.760]   I have come to recognize there is no greater joy in life
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.100]   than to know Christ.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.680]   The world and all its riches will waste away
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.680]   and thus placing any hope in the fleeting gratifications
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.520]   the world may offer is futile.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.640]   He pursues me relentlessly even when I push him away
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.180]   thinking that I know better and assuring myself
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.840]   that my sinful ways would get me further.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.320]   I am so undeserving of his grace, yet his love
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.680]   that surpasses all understanding is a mystery
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.520]   that I am so thankful for.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.720]   I'm getting baptized through immersion to complete
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.600]   the picture of baptism the way Christ commanded.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.160]   As a follower of Christ, I want to mirror what he has
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.200]   modeled and called me to do.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.420]   While salvation does not promise me a life free
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:32.360]   from troubles, I know Christ is truly enough for me
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.200]   and my home is ultimately not on this earth.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.520]   I am far from perfect and I still sin daily,
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.300]   but I know that my identity is in Christ
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.680]   and only he can truly satisfy.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.440]   I know my future is in his hands
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.400]   and I want to follow where he leads me.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:50.480]   (audience applauding)
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:54.820]   (audience member speaking off mic)
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.980]   (audience applauding)
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:02.320]   (audience member speaking off mic)
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:29.500]   (audience applauding)
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:44.140]   - All right, thank you, Tiffany, for your testimony.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.860]   Well, good morning, everybody.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:51.660]   As most of you know, summer is almost over
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:56.100]   and midweek Bible studies resume in about a week.
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.740]   From September to December, our entire church,
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.220]   including the youth and all the way down
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.620]   to the children's ministry, will be doing
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:07.440]   an inductive Bible study through Paul's epistle to Titus.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.940]   So in the book of Titus, we're gonna find instructions
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:14.160]   on how to do church, what to expect of church leadership,
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.580]   how to combat false teachers and false teachings.
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:21.180]   We will learn God's blueprint for building strong churches
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.580]   that are effective in evangelism.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:24.780]   And we will learn about how Christians
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.180]   are to conduct themselves in the pagan world
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.780]   that surrounds them.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.780]   So Titus has a lot to say about how we're gonna engage
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:36.020]   the world around us and I know that many of you
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.420]   are excited to dive into the study.
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:40.480]   And the sermon today will serve in some ways
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.660]   as an introduction to the series and to the book.
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:46.980]   And hopefully it whets your appetite for more.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.780]   I'm gonna start by reading the first five verses
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.900]   of Titus for you and then we're gonna ask the Lord
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:55.100]   really to speak this morning to our hearts.
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.420]   Titus one, one through five.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:02.940]   Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.500]   for the faith of those chosen of God
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.820]   and the knowledge of the truth
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:09.260]   which is according to godliness.
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.740]   In the hope of eternal life, which God who cannot lie
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:17.020]   promised long ages ago, but at the proper time manifested,
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:20.100]   even his word, in the proclamation with which
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.580]   I was entrusted according to the commandment of God,
[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:23.660]   our Savior.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.960]   To Titus, my true child in a common faith,
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.220]   grace and peace from God the Father
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.860]   and Christ Jesus our Savior.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.300]   For this reason I left you in Crete,
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.020]   that you would set in order what remains
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:42.380]   and appoint elders in every city as I directed you.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:43.380]   Let's pray together.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.680]   Lord, we are very thankful just that you give us
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   a freedom to worship, to hear your truths.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.680]   And by your grace, would you allow us
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.000]   to respond appropriately this morning,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.080]   to have our souls fed, that we would be filled with joy,
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.760]   that we would be filled with power,
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.040]   that we would know how best to display
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.880]   the reflection of your glory to the world
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.400]   that is lost around us.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.880]   Would you hide your servant behind this pulpit
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.780]   and would you speak and minister to your sheep?
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.180]   We thank you for this time.
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:31.880]   We ask for your blessing and we pray these things
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.720]   in Jesus' name.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:37.380]   Up to about 15 years ago, when the majority
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.120]   of our church members were still in their early 20s,
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.860]   we had about one wedding a year.
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.160]   And it was a big deal, not just for the couple,
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.040]   but for the entire church.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.520]   So every engagement was announced
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.560]   and the wedding was an all-church event.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.160]   If there was a church member's wedding
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.520]   in any particular month, that bridal shower,
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.220]   the bachelor party, the rehearsal,
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:03.240]   and obviously the wedding were all included
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:06.680]   into the church schedule, into the church calendar.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:10.080]   And if you were a Berean, you didn't need an invite.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.520]   Okay, you just assumed you were invited.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.920]   And it was also assumed that you would stick around
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.920]   after the wedding to help clean up.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.860]   And obviously those days are long gone and far behind us
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.520]   and we are no longer at that stage in our church.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.800]   Now we have lots of weddings going on throughout the year.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.680]   All four of the pastors were at a wedding just yesterday.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:39.480]   In the five-week stretch from October 16th to November 13th,
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:43.280]   in those five weeks, we have six Berean weddings
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.880]   scheduled and every single weekend,
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.320]   at least one of our pastors will be officiating
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.720]   a wedding somewhere, six weddings in five weeks.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.720]   So at present, we have a bunch of engaged couples
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.880]   and lots of pre-marital counseling sessions going on.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.080]   Many of you in this room have been engaged.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.400]   So you know that the engagement period
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.360]   can be a strange and challenging one.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.140]   There's a degree of struggle and tension
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.940]   as a couple prepares for a life of oneness,
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.940]   but they still need to function as two separate individuals.
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.960]   The couple is growing in knowledge of each other
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.240]   as a future life partner,
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.960]   but they're still not technically married.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.400]   They want so badly to be fully together,
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.840]   but for all intents and purposes,
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:31.840]   there is still much need to do things separately.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.520]   So the engagement period is not easy, but it is important.
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:36.760]   It's necessary.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.560]   And there are things to be planned and prepared
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.120]   during the engagement and there's work to be done.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.580]   A wedding needs to be planned.
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.860]   And if you skip the engagement,
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:50.520]   no one's gonna come to your party, your wedding,
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.420]   if you're even going to have a wedding at all.
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:56.380]   And there's one thing that all engaged couples
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.420]   have in common and it's this.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:03.740]   They want the engagement to end.
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:05.820]   They want it done.
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.260]   They don't wanna plan a wedding anymore.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:09.660]   They just wanna be married.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.560]   I haven't met a single person
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.160]   who wants to stay engaged forever.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:18.400]   And the Christian life on this side of eternity
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.200]   is very similar to an engagement.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.360]   A pledge has been made,
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.360]   but it has not yet been actualized or consummated.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.720]   We now belong to the Lord,
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.760]   but are not quite yet with the Lord.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.860]   We have access to the bridegroom
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.240]   and we're called to grow in the knowledge of him,
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:41.180]   but for now this knowledge is in part and not yet in full.
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:44.000]   So just as there is an already but not yet tension
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.960]   in an engagement period,
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.040]   the same is true of the Christian life.
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:51.320]   I've been memorizing through Titus
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:55.840]   and chewing on the book of Titus for the last few months.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.780]   And the more I recite this book in my head,
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.900]   the more I meditate on these verses,
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:03.240]   the more my mind keeps picturing
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.100]   an engaged couple preparing for a wedding.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.940]   I see many guiding principles in the book of Titus
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.620]   that parallel a Christian engagement.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.820]   The central figure in the book of Titus
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:17.540]   is the bridegroom Christ Jesus,
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:19.380]   and the church looks forward
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.480]   to the coming of the bridegroom.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.460]   And the church faithfully stewards this engagement period
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.860]   in which she finds herself.
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.900]   There are instructions detailing how she is
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.660]   to conduct herself while she waits,
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.620]   and that is the heartbeat of Titus.
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:38.260]   So for a legitimate few seconds,
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.060]   I actually was contemplating naming
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:44.020]   our Bible study series Rules of Engagement.
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.860]   But I just ended up with the more conservative life
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:47.700]   in the father's house,
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.940]   so you guys wouldn't be shocked or freaked out or confused.
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.700]   But keep this engagement imagery in mind,
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.580]   and hopefully you too will come to observe
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:59.180]   and appreciate the similarities.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:02.100]   So I read the first five verses of Titus a few moments ago,
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.420]   and the sermon today will be a preview to the study.
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:08.820]   And today's sermon outline is as follows.
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.340]   First, I'm gonna start with the premise of the letter,
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.140]   chapters one, verses two and three.
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.060]   Okay, chapter one, verse two and three, it's the premise.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:20.180]   And then we're gonna be looking at
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.540]   the practice of the letter,
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.420]   okay, how it's meant to be applied.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:28.220]   And then I'm gonna backtrack,
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.580]   and in verse one, we're gonna look at
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.600]   the purpose of the letter.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.260]   The premise, practice, and purpose.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.180]   And now I'm guessing that the order of this outline
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.980]   is already rubbing some of you the wrong way.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:39.660]   Some of you guys were more anal,
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:41.580]   'cause I'm doing the one at the end, okay.
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.140]   And in your inductive study,
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:46.780]   the order of the points is gonna be different.
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.900]   If I were teaching this as a Bible study,
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.700]   the order would be different, okay.
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.780]   But because I'll be spending the bulk of my time
[00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:55.820]   on verse one this morning,
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:56.980]   this is how I've organized it.
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:58.180]   So hopefully this will make more sense
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.180]   as we move through the text and the message.
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:04.100]   The premise of the epistle to Titus,
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.580]   the practice of the epistle to Titus,
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.820]   and then we're gonna be talking about the purpose.
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.100]   Okay, so the premise of the letter,
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.620]   verses two and three.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:14.380]   Verse two starts grammatically mid-sentence.
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.480]   So in order to avoid further aggravating you,
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.380]   I'm gonna just read from verse one, all right.
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:21.340]   So let me read the three opening verses again for you.
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:25.940]   Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.620]   for the faith of those chosen of God
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:28.980]   and the knowledge of the truth,
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:31.380]   which is according to godliness,
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.900]   in the hope of eternal life,
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:37.120]   which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago,
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:40.140]   but at the proper time manifested even his word
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.900]   in the proclamation with which I was entrusted
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:46.060]   according to the commandment of God our Savior.
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.460]   In the hope of eternal life.
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.620]   So here in the opening verses,
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:53.400]   the apostle Paul says that he has been preaching
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.900]   because there's a future hope.
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:59.580]   He's been commanded to preach because of this future hope.
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:04.220]   The bridegroom will return and that those chosen of God
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.420]   will be betrothed to him forever.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:08.460]   And this is guaranteed.
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.820]   God has promised this
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.700]   and God always makes good on his promises.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.380]   So when I proposed to my wife, Becky,
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.740]   about 15 and a half years ago,
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.820]   I wrote a song and I proposed to her in the song
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:24.020]   and I'm gonna read a very, very cheesy line for you
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.820]   in this dumb song, okay?
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:31.900]   I'll make all your dreams come true.
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:36.180]   I'll cook, clean, do the dishes, and diapers too.
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.840]   That was a line, okay?
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.640]   And I set myself up for failure.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:44.300]   So when guys go down on a knee
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.860]   and do their little speech before their proposal,
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.540]   we say all kinds of stuff.
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:51.900]   And we say fluffy things and make all kinds
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:56.860]   of lofty promises and we are doing our best to be sincere,
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:00.820]   but some of the stuff we say doesn't quite work out.
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:03.940]   Human promises are all too often broken,
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.980]   even with the best of intentions.
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:09.940]   And human engagements can be broken,
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:13.540]   but when God makes a pledge or a promise,
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:18.540]   he speaks absolute and certain truth.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:22.220]   So he makes good on what he says,
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:25.140]   he always has, he always will,
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:30.140]   he is all powerful, and he cannot and does not lie.
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:35.620]   When he says, he does.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:38.220]   So Ephesians 1, 13 to 14 says that we were sealed in him
[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.660]   with the Holy Spirit of promise,
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:43.620]   and he is a pledge, a guarantee of our inheritance.
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:46.620]   So eternal life awaits.
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:49.140]   Eternal life is guaranteed.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.200]   And what is eternal life?
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.780]   The Bible defines it as an eternity spent growing
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:58.220]   in intimate knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:03.220]   If your picture of eternity has no Jesus,
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:07.220]   chances are you don't have the spirit of God
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.300]   leading your heart.
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:14.300]   Eternal life is focused on a growing intimate knowledge
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.140]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:20.300]   John 17, three reads, this is eternal life,
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.540]   that they may know you, the only true God
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:26.380]   and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:30.200]   So I met my wife, Becky, in 1999.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.920]   We started dating in 2003.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:36.600]   We got married in 2007, so we became husband and wife
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:41.600]   in 2007, but our relationship began long before that.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:45.660]   Eternal life does not begin when your heart stops beating
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:48.020]   and you physically expire.
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.100]   For the Christian, it starts at the moment
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.460]   when God opens the eyes of an unbeliever,
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.740]   changes his heart of stone into a heart of flesh,
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:58.100]   and the person puts his faith in the saving work of Christ,
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:01.140]   and there is a growing love,
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.980]   there is a promise of a betrothal,
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.060]   and an eternal relationship has begun.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:10.420]   So eternal life is knowing God,
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:13.020]   and this knowledge of God begins on this side
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:15.300]   of the heavenly wedding feast.
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:20.300]   So eternal life for you and me has already begun.
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.820]   And for fuller context, I'm gonna read verses 17,
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.860]   or chapter 17, verses one through four.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.300]   Jesus spoke these things,
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:31.500]   and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said,
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:34.080]   Father, the hour has come.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.160]   Glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:41.100]   Even as you gave him authority over all flesh,
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.160]   that to all whom you have given him,
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.100]   he may give eternal life.
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.620]   This is eternal life, that they may know you,
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:51.580]   the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:54.580]   I glorified you on the earth,
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:58.180]   having accomplished the work which you have given me to do.
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:02.000]   This is the last recorded prayer.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.020]   Jesus prays before his trial and eventual crucifixion.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.220]   So what was that work, past tense,
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.940]   that Jesus accomplished on the earth?
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:14.580]   It was to give sinful man access
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.420]   to holy God through the cross.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.340]   So the earth and this life on earth
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:22.040]   still remains in judgment.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.100]   It is still corrupted.
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.900]   It still stands condemned,
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:29.700]   but access to the knowledge of God
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.380]   has now been granted and initiated,
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:36.140]   and the bride of Christ now waits with eager expectation
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.260]   for the bridegroom's return.
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:41.860]   So eternal life is already, but not yet.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:45.100]   The engagement ceremony is past,
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:50.580]   but the wedding for the bride of Christ is still future.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:53.440]   So what are the contents of Titus founded upon?
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.260]   What is the premise of the book of Titus?
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:58.500]   J.P. Green writes,
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:01.900]   "Confident expectation based on the promise
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.700]   "of the unlying God."
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:09.240]   There's gonna be a wedding, y'all, is what he's saying,
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.400]   is guaranteed.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.940]   So the church is now eagerly waiting
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:16.100]   for the great wedding feast.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:18.700]   And if you want a description of this wedding feast,
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:22.000]   look at Revelation 19, okay?
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.420]   But for now, at present, the church is in this already,
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:28.500]   but not yet engagement, tension, and struggle.
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:32.120]   But while she waits, she has work to do.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.520]   So the promise is the premise.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.880]   The promise of eternal life is the premise
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.920]   on which this church exists.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.760]   The promise of eternal life is the premise
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.560]   on which Paul is commanded to preach.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:47.960]   And the promise is the premise
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:50.600]   for which Titus finds himself in Crete.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.760]   So which brings us to our second point.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.320]   The premise is the promise, okay?
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:02.880]   So here is the expected practice of the letter.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.760]   The practice of the letter.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:07.000]   So what was Paul's expectation of Titus?
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.120]   What were his expectations of the churches in Crete?
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.880]   And what are the Lord's expectations
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:13.400]   of a church like ours?
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.160]   Okay, I'm gonna read verses four and five again for you.
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:20.320]   To Titus, my true child in a common faith,
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.760]   grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus,
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:28.760]   our Savior, for this reason I left you in Crete,
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.600]   that you would set in order what remains
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.320]   and appoint elders in every city as I directed you.
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:40.160]   So for this reason, okay, Paul left Titus in Crete.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.760]   There is an expected application.
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:47.520]   The this in for this reason is the premise
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.000]   that we just looked at in verses two and three.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.440]   The practice begins in verse five
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:54.760]   and continues throughout the rest of the letter
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:58.360]   with very specific instructions for the church,
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:57:59.640]   the bride of Christ.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:04.920]   So the all-important engagement period has been initiated.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.640]   There will be a wedding feast.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.480]   All are invited.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:11.440]   Proper wedding garments have been supplied already
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.880]   by the bridegroom.
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:16.320]   And a seat at the table is guaranteed
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:19.520]   for all who are dressed in those garments.
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:23.160]   So what is this bride to do while she waits?
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.680]   Beautify herself.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:29.960]   We are to build up the church.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.200]   That's the practice.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:35.880]   So Titus was to do his best to build the church
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:38.320]   in the way God would want it built.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:43.400]   And the specifics we'll see in the rest of the letter,
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.680]   God's way of doing life in God's church,
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.880]   leaders leading the way God would have them lead,
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:52.920]   older men in the church conducting themselves
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:55.460]   in ways that are appropriate,
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:59.300]   younger men and women behaving properly in God's church,
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:04.300]   bond slaves being exemplary in God's church,
[00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:07.560]   what to drive out of God's church,
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:10.360]   what to defend God's church from,
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:14.680]   and how God's church is to interact
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.360]   with the outside pagan world.
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:19.420]   So the church of God is very important.
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:23.400]   It's the primary vehicle through which the invitations
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.880]   to the kingdom of God are gonna go out.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.000]   It's the means through which disciples of Jesus
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.200]   will be made and grown.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:35.760]   And the building of God's church was the priority
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.680]   for Jesus' early followers.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.840]   So if you guys think through how did the early apostles,
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:44.020]   how did the apostles, what did they engage in?
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:45.960]   Did the 12 of them make 12 disciples
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.920]   and instruct them to make 12 disciples more
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:51.220]   in some kind of like multi-level pyramid strategy?
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:54.400]   No, they all folked, they went all in on the church.
[00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:00.140]   They built churches, they poured all their energies
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.660]   into the churches, why?
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:05.300]   First Timothy 3.15, the latter part reads,
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.920]   I write so that you will know how one ought
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.880]   to conduct himself in the household of God,
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.040]   which is the church of the living God,
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.260]   the pillar and support of the truth.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.600]   So the church of the living God is the pillar
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.580]   and support of the truth.
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:24.140]   The ESV translate this buttress,
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:27.620]   the King James translates it like ground,
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.380]   the dynamic translations like the NIV
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:32.080]   will call it a foundation, okay?
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.800]   So the church is the pillar and foundation of the truth,
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.180]   it's the platform through which the truth of God
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:41.420]   is magnified and displayed.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:44.940]   And because the church of God is going to be
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:47.820]   on full display for the world,
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:52.100]   what she puts on display needs to be reflective
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.700]   of the bridegroom to whom she is pledged.
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:01:00.780]   And the two things that are put on display are one,
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.520]   the teaching of the church,
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.000]   and two, the deeds of the church.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.740]   Teaching and deeds.
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.060]   Paul had similar instructions for Timothy,
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:13.780]   that he was to watch his doctrine and his life closely.
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:16.460]   Teaching and deeds.
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:20.060]   So in Titus one through five and following,
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:23.820]   Paul starts with instructions for church leaders,
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:25.740]   for elders, and that's how you get those little sections
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:28.360]   of qualifications.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:32.100]   The elders of the church are to be at the very front,
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:35.380]   modeling correct teaching and correct behavior
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:38.480]   for the rest of the church to see.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.820]   So verse nine of Titus one emphasizes
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:43.820]   that the leaders of the church need to hold fast
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:47.580]   the faithful word, which is in accordance with the teaching.
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:50.220]   So church leaders need to make sure
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.260]   that their doctrine is sound,
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:55.240]   that they are teaching accurately.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:00.240]   And as an aside, and that's why our church stresses
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.760]   expository verse by verse preaching.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:07.200]   The culture around us doesn't tell us
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.220]   what we preach and teach.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:14.020]   The affairs of the world, national crises,
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:17.340]   don't dictate what we teach and preach.
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:21.460]   The scriptures dictate what we preach and teach,
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:24.660]   and because God's word is living and active,
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:27.460]   when we preach accurately from the scriptures,
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:30.860]   the spirit of God will go forth from this pulpit
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:34.860]   and instruct and feed and guide his people into all truth,
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:37.060]   we read in John 16, 13.
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.300]   And his word will not return void.
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:43.960]   So teaching is the first important practice for the church
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:48.040]   while she awaits the bridegroom's return.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.540]   And through that teaching, the invitations come.
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:55.980]   The second practice involves the church's deeds,
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.320]   her good works.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.680]   The apostle Paul writes at length to Titus
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.800]   about the importance of the deeds
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.380]   of the church and her members.
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.600]   So this is emphasized again and again.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.520]   Godliness is to be measurable.
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.080]   Godliness is to be measurable.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.740]   The doctrine of God in and of itself is beautiful,
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:24.480]   but it needs to be adorned, cosmeo,
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.080]   by the members of the church.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:31.080]   We get the word cosmetic from this word cosmeo, to adorn.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:36.560]   A beautiful woman without makeup,
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.440]   she's still beautiful.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.680]   I guess, follow me?
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.520]   Okay?
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.080]   But when you apply the proper cosmetics
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.980]   on an already beautiful woman,
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:51.520]   she becomes next level radiant
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.960]   and she catches the eye of everybody.
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.040]   So the doctrines of God are beautiful
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.360]   in and of themselves, but how much more radiant
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.560]   would they be when the church adorns itself
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.480]   with godly deeds?
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.600]   So the church, Titus is hearing,
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.600]   needs to be characterized by good deeds.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:12.920]   Why?
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:16.900]   Because the church is on display for all the world to see.
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:20.880]   The church's faith must lead to visible good works.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.260]   Good deeds or good works, if you're using the ESV,
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.540]   are repeated again and again and again and again in Titus,
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.540]   and I just compiled a list for you here.
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:33.220]   116, by their deeds they deny him,
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.520]   worthless for any good deed.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:37.300]   27, example of good deeds.
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:40.120]   214, redeem us from every lawless deed.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:43.360]   214, a people zealous for good deeds.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.520]   311, be ready for every good deed.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.840]   315, he saved us not on the basis of deeds.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.040]   38, careful to engage in good deeds.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.720]   314, at the end of the letter,
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.400]   just in case Titus didn't catch it,
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.560]   Paul writes it again.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:02.560]   Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.800]   You know what happens when church members
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.200]   are properly adorning themselves
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.320]   and accurately displaying the glory of God?
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.920]   Opponents are put to shame.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:18.440]   Blaspheming and ridiculing mouths are silenced.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.960]   All they can say is, you guys are weird.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:25.640]   Titus 2, 7, 8.
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:32.920]   In all things, show yourself to be an example of good deeds,
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.460]   with purity in doctrine, dignified,
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:41.040]   sound in speech which is beyond reproach,
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.300]   so that the opponent will be put to shame,
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:47.240]   having nothing bad to say about us.
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.960]   So over the next three months,
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.720]   we will be diving into a deep study
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.020]   of how God would have us build this church.
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.360]   And may this study produce in our church
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.680]   many good deeds for his glory, amen?
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:02.820]   So we looked at the premise of the letter,
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:05.040]   the promise, that was the premise.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.540]   We know that the practice or application of this premise
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:12.280]   is to focus, go all in on the building up of his church.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:16.040]   What is the purpose of the letter?
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.660]   And we'll see it in the opening verse,
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.980]   the greeting and introduction to Titus.
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:23.860]   Verse one.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:28.940]   Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.680]   for the faith of those chosen of God,
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:32.900]   and the knowledge of the truth,
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:34.820]   which is according to godliness.
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:39.120]   Now here's something that I hope you will see
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.280]   when we study through the epistle to Titus.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:48.000]   Building the church God's way is not humanly possible.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.280]   Building the church God's way is not humanly possible.
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:57.060]   So if you were writing down an application,
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:58.960]   okay, I need to focus on building the church,
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.000]   it's not done through human effort.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.960]   So you and I in our own strength cannot build his church.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:09.760]   You and I, no matter how eager we are,
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.360]   or how devoted we are,
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:17.360]   cannot beautify or cosmeo ourselves through human effort.
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.300]   So good deeds or good works does not come
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:24.560]   from our determination or our planning.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:30.000]   Resolutions do not produce good deeds.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.960]   Human strategy, human ability, human ingenuity,
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.560]   clever management of the church,
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:39.480]   studly leaders, just wealthy members,
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:44.300]   skilled people are not enough
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.060]   to build a God-honoring church.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:49.000]   And this is touched upon from the very opening
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.060]   of the letter.
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:54.160]   First, God is the one who is doing the choosing.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.000]   Okay, so you see that, the faith of those chosen of God.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.060]   Second, godliness also comes from something
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:03.640]   outside of human effort,
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.220]   something beyond the determination of man.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:10.600]   So the Greek preposition kata,
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.880]   it's translated for.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.920]   And the English word for,
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.400]   it can mean all kinds of different things, okay?
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:23.800]   But the for usually indicates purpose.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.840]   And it appears twice in this opening verse.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.560]   And at both times, kata is followed
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.780]   by accusative singular feminine nouns, okay?
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:33.300]   So they're direct objects.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:37.980]   So faith, kata faith, and kata godliness.
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:40.440]   So Paul is writing this letter to Titus
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.280]   to primarily address and encourage,
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:45.080]   one, the faith of the elect of God,
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.960]   and two, the godliness of the elect.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.620]   That's the purpose of the letter.
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:53.280]   But verse one is a little tricky.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:55.160]   It's a little difficult to translate.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.600]   And that's why if you do a comparison
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.680]   of different translations,
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:01.400]   the rendering of the verses differ slightly.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.400]   And the biggest question here is,
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.400]   what is the relationship of the knowledge
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.520]   of the truth to godliness?
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:15.440]   If we're supposed to be known by good deeds,
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.160]   godliness is measurable,
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.840]   then what's this relationship with knowledge
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:25.060]   as it relates to godliness?
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.480]   Okay, so that's a very important question.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.240]   Does a knowledge of the truth lead to godliness,
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.600]   as NIV seems to suggest?
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.000]   Is godliness a measuring stick for truth?
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:35.840]   Can it be both?
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.620]   Is it both?
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.300]   Does godliness lead to greater understanding of truth?
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:42.180]   Because sometimes when I'm in a sin,
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:43.800]   I kind of forget things.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.600]   When I'm ungodly, the truth is blurred.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.720]   But when I am being more godly,
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:51.500]   does that mean the truth is highlighted in my life?
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.560]   That's an important question you're gonna wrestle with
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.680]   in about a week and a half.
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.200]   And after that, it becomes easy.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.400]   The next 45 verses aren't as bad.
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.320]   They're more clear cut.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.280]   Okay, so here's a forewarning.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.000]   If you start with it and verse one is really difficult,
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.360]   it gets better, so just don't quit, all right?
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.420]   But here's the point throughout the flow of the whole letter.
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:15.840]   Right belief and right behavior are inseparable.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.800]   You are what you know, okay?
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.580]   Right belief and right behavior are inseparable.
[01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:24.120]   My understanding of the opening of this passage
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:29.120]   is that truly right belief leads to right behavior.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.880]   Right behavior is evidence of your right belief.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.520]   If you have knowledge of God,
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.460]   but your life is not consistent with your knowledge,
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:44.560]   you prove that you actually don't have knowledge,
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.200]   that you are a buffoon,
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.760]   and that you are in denial and rebellion toward God.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.020]   Titus 1:16.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.740]   They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny him,
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:58.480]   being detestable and disobedient
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.300]   and worthless for any good deed.
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:05.600]   So right belief and right behavior are inseparable.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:12.040]   And in Titus, you find people of the circumcision,
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:16.840]   and you find lazy gluttons in Crete, okay?
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.040]   They all profess to know God,
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.200]   but they have no idea what it is that they're professing.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:28.080]   They're professing to be wise, but they are fools.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.660]   Romans 1:22 says something very similar.
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:33.340]   Professing to be wise, they became fools.
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:36.800]   So the Bible makes it clear
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.400]   that genuine knowledge of the truth
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.660]   always produces godliness.
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:44.540]   So this begs an important question.
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:47.840]   What then is the knowledge of the truth?
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.320]   (audience murmuring)
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:56.320]   If godly deeds are expected from me, from the church,
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.000]   and there's a relationship between godly deeds
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.080]   and knowledge of the truth, I need some more of that.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.760]   How do I apply this?
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.240]   So what is knowledge of the truth?
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.160]   And that is a very important question,
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.520]   and I'm gonna start with some things
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.680]   that are mistaken for the knowledge of the truth, okay?
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.480]   First one is having correct
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.320]   or extensive theological proficiency.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:25.520]   Having correct or extensive theological proficiency.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.320]   You can be well-read in your theology
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:34.160]   and still not know God and still not know the truth.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:40.360]   You can be a biblical scholar and still not know the truth.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:45.040]   Being raised in Sunday school
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.640]   and being familiar with all the stories,
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.720]   is that knowledge of the truth?
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:51.960]   Being at church for three decades, four decades,
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:56.120]   five decades out of my life, we do church every Sunday.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.840]   Is that knowledge of the truth?
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:02.640]   As an aside, one of the problems of my generation
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.600]   is that many of us have only grown up
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:07.520]   on children's Bible theology.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.440]   And what is that?
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:13.040]   Where 40% of all my Christianity is Genesis,
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.640]   50% of all my Christianity is Jesus,
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.680]   his miracles and his road to the cross,
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.680]   and the 10% is Jonah, David, Samson, Goliath,
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:22.200]   and some Elijah and Elisha.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.760]   That's my faith, one saved, always saved,
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.080]   don't mess with me, my eternity is secure.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.840]   That's children's Bible theology.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:33.680]   Another thing that's often mistaken
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.200]   for the knowledge of the truth,
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:40.440]   is having a strong moral compass or a tender conscience.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.480]   Hey, you know that guy, every time he sees
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:47.200]   a poor person on the street, he gets teary.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.360]   He's moved to compassion, he's moved to give.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.000]   That guy has something that I don't have.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.280]   Maybe he knows God, he's closer to God
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.760]   because he's so generous with people.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.840]   And this person never loses her temper.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.000]   She's such a good listener.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.800]   She is so nice.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.800]   When our pastor is very mean.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:09.280]   Maybe she knows something,
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:11.200]   there's a knowledge of God in her.
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.400]   That's also sometimes mistaken as knowledge of the truth.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.120]   Having a passion for strong Christian values
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:23.040]   is often mistaken for knowledge of the truth.
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.200]   Don't drink, don't cuss, don't gamble, don't cheat,
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.440]   don't watch inappropriate things, don't do, don't do.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.360]   And I value those things.
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:37.320]   That's not knowledge of the truth.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:40.720]   Being active in a church,
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.240]   being active in a Bible church,
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.920]   does not equate to knowledge of the truth.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.760]   And these are things that are often mistaken
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:53.680]   for knowledge of the truth.
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.440]   Knowledge of the truth will always lead to these things.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:01.520]   Having better theology, having a tender, compassionate heart,
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:06.080]   being active in church, having strong Christian principles
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.400]   and values, knowledge of the truth always leads
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.160]   to those things, but it's possible
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.920]   for the habitual church attender to have all
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.400]   of these things and have no knowledge of the truth.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:21.320]   Knowing a lot about God is not the same as knowing God.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.360]   Getting a dating app, finding a girl
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.600]   that seems attractive on paper,
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.960]   pursuing her just from that through text,
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.480]   engaging in an email is not a relationship.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:38.160]   Knowing a lot about God is not the same as knowing God.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.280]   And I wanna share with you a couple
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.520]   of Jesus' own definitions to describe
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.520]   what the knowledge of the truth entails.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:49.800]   There's a belief, there's a discerning
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.520]   of the shepherd's voice, and a following.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.920]   Okay, John 10, 26, 28.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.560]   There's a belief, a discerning of the shepherd's voice,
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.600]   and a following.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:03.240]   You do not believe because you are not of my sheep.
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:08.760]   My sheep hear my voice, and I know them,
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:12.520]   and they follow me, and I give eternal life to them,
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.480]   and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.480]   out of my hand.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.120]   That's one aspect of it.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:24.080]   Knowledge of the truth is also what sanctifies
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:24.960]   a believer of Christ.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:29.960]   John 17, 17, sanctify them in the truth.
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.600]   Your word is truth.
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.960]   So what is this?
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:41.320]   What does it mean to know the truth?
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:47.680]   This is my definition, an intimate and growing understanding
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.440]   of the heart of God through feeding from the word of God.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:58.960]   An intimate and growing understanding of the heart of God
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.840]   through feeding from the word of God.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:07.760]   And knowledge of the truth always leads to the godliness
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:08.600]   of the believer.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.880]   So here are two questions that I wanna throw at you.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:17.480]   Are you a godly person?
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:22.840]   And here's another question.
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:26.240]   How do you become more godly?
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.800]   Morning prayer?
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.160]   Memorize Titus?
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.680]   How do you become more godly?
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.840]   Give money to the poor?
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.320]   Be patient with those who wrong you?
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:43.440]   I've been a Christian for 28 years now.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.640]   This is my 21st year of pastoral ministry.
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:53.600]   And the older I get, the more I grow in pastoral ministry,
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.200]   with each passing year of being a Christian.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:00.920]   It's strange 'cause the more inadequate,
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:04.800]   the more hypocritical, and the dirtier I feel.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:09.760]   When I was a pastor in my 20s,
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:15.320]   I would tell myself and psych myself up,
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.200]   dude, you're God's gift to Christendom.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.480]   Change the world for Jesus.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.640]   You can do it.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:25.800]   You can do all things through Christ who strengthens you.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:31.040]   God needs you, was what I thought.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:36.400]   And then I hit my 30s, and I matured a little.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:41.920]   It was, okay, accurately handle God's word.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:44.880]   Be faithful to God's word.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:49.080]   But now I'm a few years into my 40s,
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.880]   and you know what my mantra is now?
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.640]   Don't do something so stupid
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.400]   and get disqualified from ministry.
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.840]   Don't be stupid and get disqualified from ministry.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:05.120]   With each passing year,
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.520]   I'm becoming more increasingly aware of who I'm not.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.760]   There is nothing good in me outside of Christ,
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.320]   and I'm becoming more and more aware of my hopelessness
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:21.440]   without the grace of God sustaining me day to day.
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:26.640]   There is so much in my heart that desires comfort,
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:28.880]   pleasure, glory.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.360]   In my heart, there are areas of it
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:37.240]   that are still so fond of sin.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:43.320]   And I, in my effort, always mess things up,
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.240]   and I taint everything.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:50.400]   When I work hard for something spiritual and it goes well,
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.720]   you know who I want to give credit to?
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.640]   I can package it before you in a nice way,
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.920]   but when I do something spiritually well,
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.720]   I try to take the credit.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:07.880]   If I teach or preach or lead well,
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:12.520]   I naturally attribute it to my preparation,
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.520]   my hard work, my skill.
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:22.800]   The harder I work, the more I corrupt,
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.640]   the more I taint, the more I just make things
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.000]   foul and dirty.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.960]   So I'm discovering that my hard work
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.480]   has done nothing but to frustrate
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:41.400]   and only make me more outwardly religious.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:47.640]   No amount of hard work has made me any godlier
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.760]   in the last 28 years as a Christian
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.920]   or 21 years as a pastor.
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:59.400]   And I've realized something through the years.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:03.880]   There's actually only one thing I can control,
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:08.720]   one thing I can pursue to become godlier
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:13.080]   and more Christ-like, repentance.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:18.640]   You know, the more I study the scriptures,
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.480]   the ungodlier I feel.
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:26.680]   The more hypocritical I sound in my head as I preach.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:31.880]   The more I study God's word, the more the blemishes
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.360]   and the blotches and the dirty things that I see.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:38.280]   The more I study the scriptures,
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:41.560]   I'm reminded that not only do I not measure up,
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:46.440]   there's a lot still in me that just stands
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:51.440]   in outright rebellion toward the God of the universe.
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:56.560]   So the only thing that I can pursue and control really
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:02.920]   is not to resist when his word washes me,
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:05.160]   when his word purifies me,
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:08.000]   when his word cuts me and carves me up,
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.920]   not to resist and just surrender.
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.760]   I can't work any harder to become godlier,
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:24.880]   but I can stay exposing my heart before the word of God,
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:31.620]   and he sanctifies and purifies and washes me.
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:36.560]   And whenever the areas of sin are revealed,
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:44.080]   don't justify it, don't make excuses,
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:47.400]   just acknowledge, don't compare, and just repent.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:51.640]   You know, the interesting thing is,
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:57.640]   is as I'm interacting with God's word
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.600]   and my heart is moved to repentance,
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:05.620]   I find myself to be a more zealous worshiper.
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:10.840]   As I'm sitting there humiliated and humble,
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:11.940]   the few things happen.
[01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:17.500]   The grace of God, the cross of Christ
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:20.380]   becomes that much more beautiful.
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:22.180]   The forgiveness and the patience of God
[01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:24.000]   becomes that much more sweet.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.260]   The forest in my eyes get exposed,
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:30.460]   so when I see a little speck in someone else,
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:35.220]   I have compassion and love and patience.
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:41.860]   Repenting before the word, before the Lord,
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:47.500]   leads me to have a greater appreciation of my savior.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:48.560]   I grow more loving.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:51.860]   You know, funny thing is,
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:57.180]   true biblical knowledge never leads to legalism.
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:00.660]   Does that make sense?
[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:04.520]   True biblical knowledge never leads to legalism.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:08.460]   Legalism comes from biblical illiteracy.
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.900]   It's spiritual ignorance on fire.
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:18.740]   True biblical literacy, where you know the truth of God,
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:24.860]   will always bring forth terror, humility, and compassion.
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:30.620]   That always happens, because the knowledge of the truth
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:33.920]   sanctifies and beautifies the believer.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.420]   Godliness does not come from effort or hard work.
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:42.420]   It's the bridegroom who washes and sanctifies.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:44.780]   You know, you and I are like sponges.
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:48.620]   Sponges, a lot of times, you look at it from the surface,
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:49.860]   it doesn't look dirty.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:53.380]   But when you squeeze the thing, what happens?
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:54.220]   Ew!
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:25:00.220]   Sometimes when I am squose, I'm shocked by what comes out.
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:03.620]   You put me in a circumstance and squeeze me,
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:06.540]   stuff comes out, and then I'm embarrassed,
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:07.820]   and I'm shocked.
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:11.380]   But how do you clean a sponge?
[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:16.900]   You dunk it, squeeze it.
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:21.900]   Dunk, squeeze, dunk, squeeze, dunk, squeeze, dunk, squeeze,
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:26.980]   until all that is left after every squeeze is clean water.
[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:32.100]   Ephesians 5, 26 to 27,
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:37.420]   and this is often used at weddings.
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:38.720]   Husbands, love your wives.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.820]   And this is speaking of Jesus,
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:45.620]   so that he might sanctify her,
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:51.220]   having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:57.740]   that he might present to himself the church in all her glory,
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:03.740]   having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing,
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:06.140]   but that she would be holy and blameless.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:11.660]   So godliness does not come through effort or hard work.
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:14.260]   It comes from an ever-increasing,
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:16.740]   intimate knowledge of the truth.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:21.660]   It comes from being daily sanctified by the word of God.
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:28.140]   And that process always produces good deeds.
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:29.420]   Why?
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:31.980]   Because a bridegroom takes very seriously
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:36.500]   the purification of the church,
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.140]   the godliness of the believer.
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:42.420]   His word will not return void.
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:47.340]   The bridegroom takes responsibility
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:49.100]   for the purification of his bride,
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:53.500]   and as he purifies, he makes beautiful and godly,
[01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:59.700]   and he sets free from the bondage to slavery
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:01.780]   and to decay and to corruption.
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:02.820]   John 8, 32.
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:06.420]   You will know the truth.
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:07.540]   And what does that do?
[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:10.100]   It sets you free.
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:16.420]   So the premise of the letter to Titus is God made a promise,
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:18.300]   and he always delivers.
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.660]   Eternal life is already, but not yet.
[01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:22.580]   So while we're waiting,
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:25.340]   there's things we need to do as a church.
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:27.420]   There's a wedding feast that's waiting ahead,
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:29.540]   and we just need to get the word out.
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:32.420]   That's the practice of the book of Titus,
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:37.900]   but the purpose of the letter to Titus is to emphasize
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:43.300]   the growth in the faith of the community
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:45.020]   and the growth in the godliness
[01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:47.380]   and the beautification of the bride of Christ
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:49.060]   during this already, but not yet.
[01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:55.580]   The premise was a promise,
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:57.980]   and because of this premise, we build a church.
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:01.140]   But the point of all of this is that we can only truly
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:02.540]   build a church God's way
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:06.140]   when he's the one who's doing the building
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:08.060]   in and through us.
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:08.900]   Amen?
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:13.820]   This church and this church's growth
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:17.540]   is not because of the efforts of the seven men
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:18.900]   who lead this church.
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:24.500]   His word, when it's honored, it grows the church.
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:28.940]   I'm gonna leave you with my only application.
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:35.020]   Expose your heart to the word of God as often as you can.
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:44.300]   Expose your heart to the word of God as often as you can,
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.220]   and you're not gonna like it.
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:49.780]   You're gonna hate what you find.
[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:53.700]   You're gonna hate what you find in you
[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:55.620]   so much more than what you hate
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.380]   and what you find in other people.
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:01.300]   But it's gonna break you, and the only real response
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.460]   that you can give is repentance.
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:08.980]   But as you're repenting, your thankfulness grows.
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:13.180]   The purity of your praise goes up.
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:18.260]   And for some strange, mysterious reason,
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:19.940]   you can finally love
[01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:25.820]   and finally see people through the eyes of Christ,
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:28.300]   and you can be long-suffering.
[01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:31.900]   So expose your heart to his word as often as you can.
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:36.900]   Don't resist, repent, and as he purifies you,
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.180]   observe the growth in godly deeds.
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:43.500]   Observe the fruit.
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:48.420]   Rejoice in these good fruits that come out
[01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:49.860]   and give glory to the God.
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:53.580]   And teach others to do the same.
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:56.020]   That's the only application.
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:30:01.500]   Get your hands, your dirty hands clean.
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:04.620]   Get broken before the Lord.
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:07.420]   And I'm gonna leave you a nice little summary
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:08.940]   of everything we studied together this morning.
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:11.100]   It comes from Titus 2, 11 to 15.
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:19.060]   For the grace of God has appeared,
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:22.140]   bringing salvation to all men,
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:27.580]   instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires,
[01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:30.340]   and to live sensibly, righteously,
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:32.380]   and godly in the present age.
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:35.540]   Looking for the blessed hope
[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:39.500]   and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior,
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:43.340]   Christ Jesus, we are looking forward to the wedding feast.
[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:48.580]   Verse 14, this is the bridegroom
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:52.020]   who gave himself for us
[01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:57.340]   to redeem us from every lawless deed
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:04.020]   and to purify for himself a people for his own possession,
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:09.140]   zealous for good deeds.
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:15.100]   These things speak, exhort,
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:18.860]   reprove with all authority,
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:21.420]   and let no one disregard you.
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:26.300]   I look forward to our study together,
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:28.340]   which starts in about a week and a half.
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:32.980]   And may the Lord bless us with an increase
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:36.820]   of the knowledge of the truth, amen.
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:43.780]   May he make us more godly and broken.
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:45.940]   And loving.
[01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:51.300]   So I'm hoping you guys are excited about the book of Titus
[01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:55.380]   and that we grow,
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:58.900]   just delight in his word more and more as a church.
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:02.340]   I'm gonna give you a minute to pray
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:03.740]   as the praise team comes up.
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:11.580]   And I encourage you to just ask the Lord.
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:13.820]   Lord, am I godly?
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.740]   Do I reflect your glory well?
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:21.220]   Help me to reflect it well.
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:24.660]   And pray, and then the praise team's gonna lead us
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:26.580]   in our closing praise.
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:31.660]   (gentle music)
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:35.060]   (gentle music continues)
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:38.820]   (gentle music continues)
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:42.220]   (gentle music continues)
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:45.620]   (gentle music continues)
[01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:49.620]   (gentle music continues)
[01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:53.620]   (gentle music continues)
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:33:03.620]   (gentle music continues)
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:16.020]   (gentle music continues)
[01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:20.420]   (gentle music continues)
[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:32.420]   (gentle music continues)
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:45.420]   (gentle music continues)
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:49.820]   (gentle music continues)
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:34:06.260]   Let's all rise for the final song.
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:13.820]   (gentle music continues)
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:17.220]   (gentle music continues)

[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:55.620]   - Heavenly Father, we pray along with you
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:59.620]   that you would sanctify us through your truth.
[01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:03.620]   And we confess that your word is truth.
[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:08.620]   Continue to humble us.
[01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:14.620]   Cause us to grow in genuine repentance.
[01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:20.620]   And help us not to enjoy this engagement period so much
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:25.620]   that we forget that there is a wedding that awaits.
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:30.620]   Help us to long for you.
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:35.620]   Help us to long for our knowledge, not to just be in part.
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:41.620]   Help us to be so zealous that while we wait,
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:44.620]   that we would reflect you well.
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:48.620]   That we would give honor due your name.
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:54.620]   Our collective heartbeat and our cry is Maranatha, Lord come.

[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:08.620]   We surrender our efforts
[01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:11.620]   cause we cannot build your church properly.
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:16.620]   So we ask that as you build this church,
[01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:20.620]   let us get out of the way and surrender
[01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:24.620]   to the great bridegroom who purifies his bride.
[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:28.620]   Give us strength this week.
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:33.620]   We love you Lord, Maranatha, Amen.
