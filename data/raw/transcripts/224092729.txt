[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   If there's no other announcements, why don't we turn our Bibles to Romans Chapter 10.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.800]   I'll be reading again from 11 through 13.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.480]   And again, this is kind of a part three of this section, Confession and Belief.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.640]   Romans Chapter 10, 11 through 13.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.800]   For the scripture says, "Everyone who believes in Him will not be put to shame, for there
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.180]   is no distinction between Jew and Greek.
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.880]   For the same Lord is Lord over all, bestowing His riches on all who call on Him.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.960]   For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.960]   Let's pray.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.920]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank You for the privilege.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.320]   We thank You for the opportunity to fellowship and worship You corporately.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.120]   We ask, Lord God, that Your Word would go forth, and that only Your Word, Lord God,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.120]   would go forth.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.480]   We pray for Your grace.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.480]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.480]   Amen.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.500]   Years ago, you know, one of the older brothers who invested in me when I was in high school
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.420]   and then early college.
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.780]   I remember as a very, very young pastor, I remember driving to LA with him.
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.500]   And for whatever the reason, I forgot what context he said this, but it really stuck
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.500]   with me.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.460]   And especially because of the person that said it to me, because he's a guy who invested
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:33.420]   a lot in me when I was a younger person, and he said, Peter, be wise in, you know, which
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.220]   don't engage in, I forgot the exact words.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.220]   My mind's going blank.
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.420]   He said, be wise in which battle you fight.
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.420]   Something like that.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.420]   I don't know.
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.420]   I can't remember it.
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.420]   Okay.
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.140]   But it was something to the effect, like, don't fight over every battle.
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.860]   That was basically in essence what he was saying.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.180]   He said, not everything requires you to stand up and fight.
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.660]   You know, he said, choose your battles wisely.
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.660]   All right.
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.660]   That's what he said.
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.660]   Choose your, I'm a fob, right?
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.620]   He said, choose your battles wisely.
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:16.980]   And again, I don't remember exactly what context he said that, but I know he said that deliberately.
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.700]   That wasn't just something that he just randomly said or he read.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.460]   And he, I think, wanted to say that to me.
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.660]   I think for probably my guess is, it's because maybe I was arguing with a lot of people.
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.060]   You know, I was strong headed and I had strong opinions, and maybe I was getting into a lot
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.420]   of arguments with people.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.260]   And my guess is that's probably why he said it, because it was very intentional conversation.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.340]   And he told me, like, choose your battles wisely.
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.820]   And that really stuck with me.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.300]   You know, even to this day, that really, like, stuck with me, that you don't have to fight
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.300]   for everything.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.500]   And again, not to say that I've applied that well.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.980]   You know, my natural inclination, I'm opinionated.
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.620]   You know, I have strong opinions about everything and nothing, you know.
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.380]   But I remember that, and I try to practice that, that you don't have to fight for everything.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.600]   But there are certain things that requires a fight.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.860]   There are certain things in life that requires to gear up and need to fight.
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.820]   Some of us, maybe, our natural inclination is to fight.
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.900]   And so, maybe we need to heed that warning, that you don't really need to fight about
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.900]   everything.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.220]   Not every opinion you have is worth getting into an argument for.
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.880]   You don't have to be right about everything.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.300]   Maybe some of you guys have a personality where you don't like to be in conflict over
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.300]   anything.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.340]   So, you have a tendency to avoid any kind of conflict, and you're never fighting over
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.260]   anything.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.780]   There are certain things in life that everybody, no matter what your inclination, what your
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.100]   personality type may be, requires that you are committed to this fight.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.900]   There's two particular things in church history that if our forefathers who went before us
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.940]   did not fight, you and I would not be here.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.260]   The first, maybe 700 to about 900 years of church history, if you look at all the church
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.780]   councils, one of the main things that they wrestled with and fought was the identity
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.780]   of Christ.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.540]   And very early on, the very first church council, one of their primary debate was, "Was Jesus
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.580]   God?"
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.500]   And there was a man named Arius who was convincing, and very convincing, articulate, smart guy,
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.660]   who was so convincing that almost the whole church kind of went over and said, "There
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.740]   was a point when Jesus Christ was created."
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.780]   Now, it was not based on Scripture, but he was basing it on logic that he couldn't be
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.780]   God.
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.220]   He was a created being.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.540]   And as a result of that, here's this man named Athanasius who was fighting against this doctrine,
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.580]   that Arius was so convincing, he ended up getting disciplined and excommunicated from
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.780]   the church.
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.740]   And almost wholeheartedly, the church almost went over, but Athanasius decided that this
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.400]   was something worth fighting and possibly even dying for.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.220]   And as a result of this man's effort, that the church began to get convinced, as he began
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.740]   to apply Scripture and exposit the Scripture that they had, he began to convince them that
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.580]   it may not be easy to understand, but it is clearly taught, and it was clearly given to
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.700]   us that Jesus Christ is God.
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.020]   It wasn't the only time.
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.260]   It would keep coming up over and over again throughout church history.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.980]   And faithful men with courage fought against this false doctrine.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.660]   And that's why we have the Trinity today.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.060]   The other doctrine that we see have been fought for so heartily, and many people even gave
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.740]   their lives, is a doctrine that we've been talking about in the last few months, the
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.500]   doctrine of justification by faith.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.260]   You and I are Protestants because men of courage stood up against the church that began to
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.820]   preach that salvation is by faith and work.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.460]   You have to believe and you have to have works in your life.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.460]   And almost wholeheartedly, there was a period in church history where they just completely
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.460]   lost this doctrine.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:14.380]   And anybody who was propagating this doctrine, they disciplined, they maybe even beheaded,
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.460]   crucified.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.900]   And they were martyred for this.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.140]   But obviously, men of faith stood up, many of them giving their lives, in order that
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.980]   we may have this doctrine and to be preserved according to what Christ has done and according
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.620]   to Scripture.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.100]   Why is this doctrine so important?
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.260]   And why has Paul been pounding this over and over and over again?
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:44.300]   So if we were to summarize, at least up to this point, chapter 10 and up to chapter 11,
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.900]   one word or one phrase that could probably sum up everything that Paul has been saying
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.540]   is that salvation is by faith alone, period.
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.540]   That's what he's been saying.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.420]   He's been saying it in 50 different ways, but his main point is the same.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.380]   Salvation is by faith alone.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.240]   Now why is this so important?
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.820]   Because if we're not careful, if we're nonchalant about the details of this doctrine, you can
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:18.060]   either be living in faith in bondage, just as if you were never saved, that you adhere
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.020]   to certain doctrines, but because you don't know the details of what it means that it's
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.700]   by faith alone, you could still be caught in your legalism and living in bondage, thinking
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.300]   that somehow your efforts somehow add to your salvation and living, again, as if you were
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.460]   never saved.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:41.060]   But the other end of the spectrum is to live with false freedom, the thinking that, "Oh,
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.300]   it's justification by faith alone, so what we do doesn't matter," and you have a false
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:51.940]   sense of security and realizing until you meet Christ that you didn't know Christ at
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.020]   all.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:08:00.340]   The either extreme, the either extreme of it could possibly mean that you didn't have
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.060]   saving faith.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.820]   You see why this doctrine is so important, that we get it right, that we do not turn
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:14.820]   from it to the left or to the right, because not having biblical saving faith ultimately
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.780]   means that you are not saved.
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.860]   So it's extremely important for us that we understand what Paul is saying, not superficially,
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.540]   not just a knee-jerk reaction.
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.060]   I've heard this all my life, so of course I'm saved, of course I'm a believer, of course
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.120]   I have genuine faith, but is it biblical?
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.300]   Is it the faith that Paul has been describing?
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.420]   Is it a cultural faith?
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:43.340]   Is it a faith that I've inherited because I was raised in a Christian home?
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.580]   Is it just superstition?
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.500]   Is it a security blanket that is like, "You know, I'm going to pretend like I have it
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:55.380]   so that after I die, at least I got a free ticket to heaven," but is it really genuine
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.520]   biblical faith that Paul has been describing?
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.620]   This morning, I'm going to be looking at these three verses, and I may not get to the third
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:08.460]   one because I didn't get to it in the first service, but again, not every sermon, I'm
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.520]   going to divide into three points, but I think that the three points helps us to follow along
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:18.260]   in the line, so I'm going to give you three things, and then I'm going to go to two today.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:25.300]   So the first one is assurance of salvation is the ultimate goal, and I'll get to that.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.940]   Paul has been doing up to this point is to give assurance of salvation.
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:39.740]   Two, in verse 12, "Same God saves with the same gospel."
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.980]   And the third point that I'm guessing I won't be able to get to is, "Same God with the same
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.100]   gospel results in the same salvation," and that's going to be the outline that I follow
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.100]   this morning.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.200]   So let's look at the first one.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.480]   Assurance of salvation is the ultimate goal.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.040]   If you're not careful, you can read all of this and come out in despair and begin to
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.280]   ask yourself, "Oh, maybe I'm not a Christian," that maybe that's Paul's goal.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.940]   Paul's goal is to shake up the church and then get people to say, "Oh, you know what?
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.940]   I'm going to leave.
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:16.440]   Maybe that's not the, you know, maybe this is really ultimately for me."
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.880]   But you have to understand that this letter is written to the church.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.920]   He's not writing to non-Christians.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.200]   He's writing this to the church, and you'll see starting from next week or maybe the week
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:32.040]   after that, his ultimate goal is try to recruit some people to take him with him to preach
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.720]   the gospel in Spain.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.900]   That's his ultimate goal.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.640]   So his goal here is not to shake up the church and weed out the church, although it may result
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.960]   in that possibly, but his ultimate goal is really to give them assurance of salvation.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:52.160]   If you look at the three verses that we're looking at, he basically says the same thing.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.640]   He's been saying the same thing, but he kind of ends with this exclamation mark.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.200]   The salvation is by faith alone, and he repeats that three separate times in three separate
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.200]   ways.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.380]   Here's verse 11, "For the scripture says, 'Everyone who believes in him will not be
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.380]   put to shame.'"
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.120]   So in other words, salvation is by faith alone.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.100]   Verse 12, "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is the Lord
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.160]   of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him."
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.700]   Salvation are for those who call on him by faith.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.700]   Same thing.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.760]   Verse 13, "For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:32.080]   So again, he's saying the same thing three separate times for the purpose of emphasis.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.000]   As I've mentioned before, anything that the scripture mentions for the purpose of emphasis,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.120]   they repeat once, twice, three times.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.480]   And whenever you see anything being repeated, it's meant to cause us to take a step back
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.680]   and say, "What is he saying?
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.860]   Why is this so important?"
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.760]   It seems so simple.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.060]   Salvation is by faith alone.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.080]   So what is there to dig?
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.240]   What is there to know?
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:03.000]   Paul has been, again, this is in summary of 10 and a half chapters.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.820]   Even though it may seem like, you know, superficious, salvation by faith, of course I know that.
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:14.440]   But if we miss the details of what it means to have the saving faith, what it means to
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.160]   confess that he is Lord and Savior, what it means to believe that he was raised from the
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.840]   dead, and how that is applied, and what that means for us as a Christian, we can completely
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.760]   miss Christ.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:34.640]   There probably is, in each one of us, a defect in the way that we believe God, in what we
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.360]   believe about God, that is causing the anxiousness.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.320]   Some things are not going right in your life, and you're not satisfied.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.240]   Now we don't always connect it to God, but majority of the time, the reason why that's
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.920]   there is because there's some kind of defect in our faith, in the way that we view God,
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.760]   in what he has promised and what he has done.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.240]   We confess it, we don't believe it.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.800]   We confess it, but it may not be accurate, it may not be biblical.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:09.320]   The whole reason why Paul has been expositing this is to confirm for the Christians what
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.320]   they believe.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.640]   That's why it says in 2 Corinthians 13, 5, "Examine yourself to see whether you are in
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.020]   the faith.
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:21.040]   Test yourselves, or do not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.560]   indeed you fail to meet the test."
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:29.160]   The reason why he says to test yourself is because this church had all kinds of problems.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.360]   There's worldliness in the church.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.600]   They were sweeping sin underneath the rug.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.960]   There were competition among brothers.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.640]   They were having communion, and they're competing with one another, and they couldn't care about
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.640]   the poor.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:46.200]   This is a divided church that's living in chaos, and he's telling them, "Possibly, are you
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.720]   living like that because you have defected faith?"
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:58.360]   So Paul is questioning not just their behavior, he's questioning, "Do you have Christ in you?"
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.200]   Now the whole reason why he's doing that, he's not saying, "I don't think you're a Christian."
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.880]   The goal of what he's trying to do is to remind them, "Do you not realize that Christ is in
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.120]   you?
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.200]   Take a close look at your faith.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:20.960]   How much of the chaos in your life, how much of the discomfort or anxiety or hatred and
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:28.280]   bitterness, wanting and not having, how much of that is because you've forgotten that Christ
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.960]   is in you, that you have Christ, and yet you're complaining and competing of trivial things?"
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.920]   And that was Paul's point.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.440]   Examine yourself to see if you're really of the faith, unless you've forgotten that Jesus
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.960]   Christ is in you.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.600]   Again in 1 John, John lays out, here's identity of a Christian.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.840]   If you are living in darkness and yet you say you have fellowship with God, you fool
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.840]   yourself.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:59.480]   That God is light and there is no darkness in Him, and that you don't fool Him, that
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.560]   is not possible.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.480]   So he lays out in detail that this is what it means to have saving faith.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.520]   You can't confess that Jesus Christ is not coming to flesh and then say that you have
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.680]   faith in God and it says you're not from God.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:18.800]   So if you look at the first four or five chapters of 1 John, it kind of shakes up the church
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.080]   and it causes us to take a step back and say, "Well, is that me or is that not me?"
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:28.780]   But he summarizes the purpose of this letter in 1 John 5, verse 13.
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:33.560]   He says, "I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.640]   you may know that you have eternal life."
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.120]   So the purpose of why John writes this letter is not to cause people to say, "Maybe I'm
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:49.040]   not, maybe I am," but to reconfirm for them their assurance of salvation.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.520]   But this assurance of salvation is not a knee-jerk reaction just because somebody doubts, which
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.600]   is something that we need to be careful about.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.920]   Because our natural reaction is if somebody says, "I'm not sure if I genuinely believe,
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:09.560]   I'm not sure if I'm genuinely saved," without knowing what the problem is, without
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:15.280]   examining their faith, our natural reaction is if that is coming from somebody who used
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.120]   to confess that they're Christian or they're a 10th church or they're a faithful member,
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.920]   our natural reaction is, "Don't ever say that.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.720]   One saved, always saved.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.760]   Salvation is by faith and not by works, so don't ever say that."
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:34.200]   And we give a superficial, knee-jerk reaction to give affirmation of faith to everybody
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.840]   and anybody.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:42.560]   He's trying to give assurance of salvation, but not a knee-jerk reaction, but a biblical
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:50.640]   faith, but a real faith, that after laying out 10 and a half chapters of this is what
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:56.760]   it means to have genuine faith, in order that if you are a genuine believer, that it would
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:04.440]   cause you to take a step back and examine your faith and to see that I am.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:10.160]   That if you've drifted away from this faith, if you maybe haven't paid attention to this
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:17.440]   faith, if you've allowed it to kind of drift out from the centrality of the saving faith,
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.800]   which is causing you to be frustrated, that you've placed your hope in anything else but
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:30.200]   Christ, it is to remind us of what it is that we have in Christ, but genuinely.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:36.640]   That's why again Paul says in 1 Timothy 6, 12, "Fight the good fight of faith."
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.480]   To fight the good fight of faith.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.640]   That this genuine saving faith is not something that just happened because you happen to choose
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.680]   to get on the right boat.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.600]   And if we're not careful, we just choose to get on the right boat and say, "Well, you
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.600]   know what?
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.280]   I made a decision to come to church and the rest of it, I just kind of coast along because
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.280]   I'm on the right boat."
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.240]   He says, "Fight the good fight of faith.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.480]   Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called."
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.720]   Take hold.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:12.000]   Take hold meaning not just to receive it, but to hold on to it for dear life.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.380]   That's what Paul was doing in Corinthians.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.600]   That's Paul's doing in Romans.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.240]   That's what John is doing in 1 John.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:24.160]   In fact, every one of these letters, these epistles are written to reaffirm for the church
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.880]   so that they may be strengthened in their genuine faith.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.200]   That they do not just coast along on this faith that they've inherited.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.500]   They do not just coast along because they've been at church for a long time.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:40.200]   That they don't just coast along just because you've been serving in a certain capacity,
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.400]   but that you have this genuine faith in Christ.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:49.920]   Again, in Hebrews 3, 14, the author of Hebrews says, "For we share in Christ if indeed we
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.800]   hold our original confidence firm to the end."
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:59.440]   The words and the language that is used here isn't by accident.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.120]   He's not just casually saying the original confidence.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:07.920]   He said, "Original confidence firm to the end."
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:15.120]   Not just starting, not just at one point, not just at the end, but firm to the end.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:21.160]   The whole point of what Paul has been saying was for the purpose of genuine faith.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:27.360]   That you would have assurance and reexamine where you are before God.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.840]   And that you would recommit and re-covenant to serve and love God with all your heart,
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.240]   soul, mind, and strength.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:38.060]   That if that's something that you did at one point in your life and you've just drifted,
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:44.220]   and you haven't been contending for your faith, the whole purpose is to give assurance to
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.560]   cause the church to recommit.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:52.640]   Again, in 1 Timothy 6, 19, it's thus storing up treasure for themselves as good foundation
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:58.120]   for the future so that they may take hold of that which is truly life, to take hold
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:02.000]   of it.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.360]   What have you been fighting for?
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.000]   There's a lot of things.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.200]   Again, as I told you, that warning or encouragement, exhortation that this older brother told me,
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.900]   and I knew it was deliberate, and I knew it was very specific to me, because I was already
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.080]   in ministry and I was passionate about everything.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.260]   I was passionate about prayer, I was passionate about evangelism, I was passionate about everything.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:35.140]   So I was getting into it with everybody and say, "Peter, choose your battles wisely."
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:40.760]   Everybody in some degree is fighting for something.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.840]   You might be fighting for your children's attention, you might be fighting with your
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:55.200]   wife to see who's right and wrong, you might be fighting to get a better job, and you might
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:01.160]   be fighting to save up enough time for your vacation.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:07.000]   Whatever it is we're fighting, every single one of us is struggling and fighting for something.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.320]   So we need to be careful that we choose our battles wisely.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:22.440]   See, where you and I live, our primary fight, at least in a tangible way, is not against
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.640]   some false gospel or false teaching.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.040]   Because you're at church, you have the scripture.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.680]   So you might hear about it, maybe possibly in the church every once in a while, you might
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.840]   hear it maybe outside the church.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.440]   Maybe you voted for Trump and you're getting persecuted somewhere.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.240]   Or somebody is saying, "How dare you believe in that?"
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.160]   I don't know if some of you guys heard the hearing a while back.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.640]   It was on the internet all over the place.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:58.800]   Bernie Sanders was basically questioning this guy for an office in the White House.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.960]   He said, "Do you really believe that Jesus is the only way and that all the religions
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.960]   are condemned?"
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:11.360]   And the guy basically answered, "I'm a believer and I'm an evangelical Christian."
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.120]   And Bernie Sanders just straight up said, "Then you're not fit to serve in the government.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.840]   We don't need people like you."
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.400]   And obviously the internet blew up.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.200]   He basically is saying, "You can't be a Christian and serve this country."
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:27.960]   As crazy as that is, that may be the environment that you are working in.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:34.280]   And so you might be fighting, maybe, but we can easily avoid that.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.960]   Just avoid all these people.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.440]   Don't say crazy things.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.760]   Don't talk about politics.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:45.040]   You can talk about religion, about Jesus, but don't try to proselytize.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.680]   So we can easily avoid those situations, which I think many of us may be doing if we're not
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.360]   careful.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:59.920]   But the day-to-day fight that you and I have oftentimes is in the church.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.760]   The day-to-day fight that you and I have, the danger that you and I live under, is within
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.520]   our own hearts to just drift.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.460]   To just drift.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.320]   You don't have to make a decision to drift.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.220]   You just don't have to fight.
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.400]   You don't have to sign a doctrinal statement saying that I'm going to agree and I'm going
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.400]   to compromise.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.400]   You don't have to do that.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.800]   Just stop fighting.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.320]   Stop contending.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.720]   Stop standing up for stuff.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.280]   Just avoid conflict.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:39.960]   All you have to do is just go along with the flow, which is our natural temptation anyway.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.560]   I mean, ever since we're young, I mean, we're a teenager, wasn't it?
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.880]   The greatest temptation is peer pressure.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.280]   Because you want to fit in.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.600]   You don't want to be bullied.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.600]   You don't want to be a weirdo.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.280]   You don't want to be bullied at work, even as an adult.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.640]   So just go along.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:06.280]   The danger, again, for all of us, the Christianity that you and I experience, is stop fighting.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.620]   Just coast along.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:15.840]   The danger that the author of Hebrews was addressing is that very thing.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:21.160]   How can we escape if we ignore, neglect such a great salvation?
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.040]   Hebrews 2.3.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.260]   How shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation?
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.280]   All you have to do is ignore it.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.680]   All you have to do is not fight.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:39.520]   All you have to do is just give yourself to raise your kids.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.160]   Now, is that sinful?
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.400]   Get a job, pay your bills.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.400]   Why is that sinful?
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.280]   Buy a house, travel a little bit, eat some, serve the church.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.040]   Why is that sinful?
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:58.200]   It may not be sinful, but if those things entangle us and we're no longer fighting
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.600]   and contending for the faith, we may have easily have drifted away.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:07.400]   And then when we examine ourselves and look at what the biblical faith looks like, we're
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.580]   nowhere near what it is.
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.840]   So the whole point that Paul has been trying to make and why he's been pounding this
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:18.160]   doctrine of justification by faith alone is not to give a superficial nod to say, it is
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.360]   not by your works that everybody is saved.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.920]   That's not the point.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.920]   The point that Paul's trying to make is that this is what genuine faith looks like.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:31.480]   It is not by what you do, but it's by genuine faith that if you confess with your mouth
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.960]   that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe with your heart that He's been raised from the
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.220]   dead, then you will be saved.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.680]   Is that true of you?
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.760]   Is that true of us?
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.100]   Is that true of our church?
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:50.440]   So the first and the most important thing that you and I need to understand, what Paul
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:57.320]   has been doing, why he's been pounding this, is to give assurance of salvation, but real
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.480]   assurance, not a security blanket.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:07.680]   Real assurance that saves us, that changes us, that empowers us.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.080]   And that's why Paul says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.120]   unto salvation."
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:19.360]   Not simply a security blanket, not simply a free ticket to save us from hell, but it
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.680]   is the power.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.880]   Do we have this assurance?
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.560]   Or is it enough?
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.720]   Is it enough just pick and choose certain things that the scripture says, and it's
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.920]   like, "Well, I feel good about it."
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:45.480]   See, I think every believer that hears what Paul says, hears what John says about all
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.040]   of this, would be shaken.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:57.600]   If you don't have real faith, what I say to you is not relevant to you.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:03.680]   So you can hear it, and say, "Okay, you know, he says that a lot, and he's saying it again."
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.320]   And it will have no effect on you, because it doesn't matter if it's true or not.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:12.080]   Because you don't believe it anyway, whether it's true or not, you don't believe it anyway,
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.080]   so it doesn't matter.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:20.160]   I can say it a thousand times, I can say it one time, it's just not relevant to you.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:30.340]   But if you do have saving faith, and you are concerned that this is true, wouldn't it cause
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:36.100]   us to take a step back and examine, exactly like Paul says in 2 Corinthians?
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:42.340]   Only people who have genuine faith would take a step back and actually examine their faith.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:49.500]   And by examining, it would cause us to question, and to recommit, and re-covenant, to make
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:57.420]   sure that when we say that we believe in Jesus, that we actually believe it.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:03.620]   That our assurance is true assurance, and not a security blanket.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:08.780]   Secondly, he says that the same God saves with the same gospel.
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:13.140]   In verse 12, he says, "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:18.380]   the Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him."
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.540]   You know, that passage here is a quote from Joel, chapter 232.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.700]   And again, let me read the whole thing straight out of the Old Testament.
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.020]   It says, "And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.380]   shall be saved."
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:33.300]   What's interesting here is Joel is referring to Yahweh.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.980]   The word for Lord is capital L, capital O, capital R, and capital D.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.580]   So you already know that in the Hebrew, when there's the word Yahweh, they translate it
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:48.020]   into Adonai, Lord, so they don't use the Lord's name in vain.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.180]   So clearly, Joel is in reference to Yahweh.
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:58.180]   But Paul here is using the same reference to refer to Jesus, that he is Lord.
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:02.860]   Now if you did not believe that Jesus Christ is God, this would have been utterly blasphemous.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:08.540]   There's a reason why Athanasius was able to convince the church that Jesus Christ is God,
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:13.900]   because of these verses and many other verses in the scripture that identify Jesus Christ
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.460]   as the God of the Old Testament.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:22.420]   So when Paul is referring to this passage, he's basically saying that that statement
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:28.220]   in Joel chapter 232 was not only in reference to the things of the Old Testament, but it
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.980]   is also relevant to the New Testament.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.760]   The same God of the Old Testament is the same God of the New Testament.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.820]   Same Lord that's saved by faith in the Old Testament is the same Lord that's saved in
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.740]   the New Testament.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:44.500]   That the same Lord saves with the same gospel.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.660]   There is no different gospel for the poor and the rich.
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.880]   There is no different gospel from the past generation to this generation.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:58.820]   There isn't a different gospel for the educated and uneducated.
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:06.460]   Now you and I may sit here in the safety of this room, you know, and we say, "Well, I
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.940]   mean, that's really not a temptation.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.220]   What are you talking about?"
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:18.340]   That temptation is all around us, to compromise, to kind of cut the edges off the gospel so
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.660]   it's not as offensive.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:25.700]   So again, there's a reason why we are eager to jump to the grace of God without convicting
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:31.300]   the sin and repentance, because it's easily acceptable.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:36.100]   If we present the gospel as the apostles presented the gospel in exactly the way that they presented
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.540]   it, exactly the way that Jesus said it, it would be offensive.
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.500]   Just like Jesus said, it would be offensive.
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:48.180]   And so we have a version of the gospel for this group of people, for this generation,
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.260]   for the educated and uneducated.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:57.060]   And again, at the core of it, we have the tenets of the gospel, but the presentation,
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:01.420]   what's being highlighted, what's not being highlighted, it all differs depending on who
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.420]   we're talking to.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.380]   And we call that contextualization.
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:11.180]   And not to say that context and contextualization culture isn't important, but there's always
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:19.340]   this temptation to alter a little bit in order that it wouldn't be as offensive.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:24.500]   That we can live in the culture and continue to pursue what we pursue and not to be rejected
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:30.980]   from our society and still follow Christ, still pick up the cross, even though everything
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.080]   in the scripture says you are light in darkness.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.500]   They didn't know me, they're not going to know you.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.380]   They rejected me, they're going to reject you.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:43.340]   But we've been trying, we try so hard to prove Jesus wrong, that it is possible.
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:50.540]   The same Lord with the same baptism, with the same preaching of the cross.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:57.220]   See, that's why Paul says in Galatians chapter 6, verse 1-6, he says, "I am astonished that
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:02.620]   you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.900]   to a different gospel."
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:11.500]   You know the gospel, the different gospel that Paul is talking about here is Judaizers.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:16.180]   Judaizers within the church did not reject Jesus' crucifixion.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:21.380]   The Judaizers in the church did not reject his resurrection.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.900]   They didn't reject his lordship.
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.780]   They didn't reject his deity.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.380]   You know what caused them to be Judaizers and perverting the gospel?
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.140]   And he says, "This is not the Lord at all.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.500]   It's a completely different gospel."
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.700]   You know why?
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:40.600]   Because they were saying that we had to maintain some of the Old Testament laws.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.860]   You still needed to observe the Sabbath.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.080]   You still needed to observe the dietary laws.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.180]   You still needed to be circumcised.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:52.140]   So basically they were taking the truth of the gospel and they were cutting off some
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.760]   of the edges.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.420]   And the reason why is because the persecution in the early church primarily came from the
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:05.100]   Jews because the first group of Christians were Jews who converted to Christianity and
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.440]   they were moving away.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:13.220]   And so in order for them to maintain their old life while embracing the lordship of Christ
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:19.620]   is to just adjust a little bit, to add a little bit of the old culture into the new culture
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.860]   and so they don't lose anything.
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:24.860]   They can still be in the synagogue, still practice some of the laws, still practice
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.060]   the dietary laws, and yet still call Jesus.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.460]   And that's the perverted gospel that Paul is pointing to in Galatians.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:36.220]   He says, let me read that again, "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.220]   called you."
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.300]   He doesn't say, "Hey, hey, stop compromising."
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:47.300]   He says, "You're deserting him in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel."
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:51.300]   That if you add to the gospel, if you take away from the gospel, he says, "It's not the
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.060]   gospel at all."
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.900]   A little perversion, a little compromise, a little taking off of the edge, in the end
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.880]   we are no longer representing Christ.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.420]   You can't be an ambassador and go to UN and say, "You know what?
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:08.580]   The president told me to say this, but I have my own opinions.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.940]   I don't think this is going to go off well, so I'm not going to say what he said, so this
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.500]   is what I think."
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.340]   Then you would no longer be an ambassador.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:21.260]   An ambassador is to call and reiterate, even with the tone, even with emotion, the exact
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:27.300]   same thing that he was ordered to do, and that's what an ambassador is.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.340]   So Paul says in verse 7, "Not that there is another one, but there is some who trouble
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.980]   you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:38.260]   But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.660]   we preach to you, let him be accursed."
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.580]   Paul says, "Even the apostles are not standing above the gospel."
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:49.460]   He says, "As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone is preaching to you a
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.700]   gospel contrary to the one we receive, let him be accursed, for I am now seeking the
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.380]   approval of man or of God, or am I trying to please man?
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:06.300]   If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ, but of man."
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:13.660]   God has given us one Lord for the Jews, for the Gentiles, for the early church today and
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:23.100]   tomorrow, that the core of what saves an individual has not changed, and it cannot change.
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.860]   And if there's anything that we're going to stick a flag on the ground and say, "Here
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:33.100]   I stand, I will not move," it is the gospel.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:39.240]   Because only by faith in Christ alone can an individual be saved.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:44.460]   And if we compromise that, if we pervert that, if we add to that, if we take away from that,
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.340]   it is no longer the gospel.
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:52.940]   There was a man that I really looked up to, and again, some of you guys may know his name,
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.660]   man named Tony Campolo.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.980]   He was a very popular preacher, in fact, probably one of my favorite preachers when I was in
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.620]   college.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:06.860]   He was dynamic, he was funny, he was powerful, and he had so many powerful stories about
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:10.980]   how he was living his Christian life, and I remember one particular story that he told
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:18.500]   often of how he invited prostitutes, and he threw a birthday party for them, and how he
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:24.500]   challenged my generation to pick up the cross and go to the streets and evangelize and welcome
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.740]   them into your home.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:29.860]   And I remember being so moved that this is the Christianity that I want to participate
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.700]   in.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:39.660]   Years later, I heard that he began to preach a gospel that wasn't the gospel at all.
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:44.780]   He began to preach the social justice gospel, meaning that Jesus' primary reason why he
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:51.740]   came is to set the captives free, and he'd identified this bondage as social injustice.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:58.660]   Injustice of poverty, injustice of this, injustice of that, and as a result of that, he was disciplined.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:04.700]   I remember J.I. Packer, Chuck Swindoll, the men who had some kind of fellowship with him,
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:09.340]   these were men of prominence, that they were concerned because here's a guy who was influencing
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.060]   our generation, and he was saying strange things.
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.500]   So they sat him aside and said, "This is not the gospel.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.860]   You're perverting the gospel."
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.600]   And so he actually publicly repented.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:23.540]   He wrote a letter, and this is before the internet, so he wrote a letter, and it got
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:28.500]   passed around, and we heard about it, and I was so encouraged by that.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:35.460]   One, that these men had enough concern to contact him and to love him enough to sit
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.620]   him down and correct him.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:42.900]   And secondly, that this man of prominence that so many thousands, hundreds of thousands
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:47.980]   of people looked up to was willing to humble himself and admit that he was an error.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:54.780]   And so we were very encouraged by all of it, but then some years went by, five, six, seven,
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:59.460]   eight, nine, ten years went by, next thing I hear is that Tony Campolo has basically
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:05.780]   left his faith, and he's beginning to preach the false gospel again, back to his origin.
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:12.700]   He was so ingrained, so desiring to wake up the church to this social gospel, he began
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.160]   to change the gospel, period.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.740]   And he began to preach again that Jesus Christ, our primary duty as Christians is to alleviate
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.240]   people from poverty.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:27.320]   And then recently, he started marching and standing with the homosexual community and
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.700]   saying, "That's not the Bible.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:32.340]   The Bible has called us to stand with them who are oppressed."
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:37.580]   And again, it kind of opened the door to all kinds of stuff.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.820]   We don't hear about him much anymore in the evangelical community because he walked away
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:41.820]   from it.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:49.540]   He's basically shunned the evangelical community, and he's no longer preaching the same gospel.
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:56.060]   Paul says to Timothy in 1 Timothy 4, 2 Timothy 4, 1 and 2, "I charge you in the presence
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:02.060]   of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:10.300]   and his kingdom, preach the word, be ready in season and out of season."
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.340]   Preach the word, be ready in season, out of season.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:17.660]   Now when Paul says to Timothy to preach the word, he's not saying, "Exposit," verse
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.460]   3, you know, "What does it say?"
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.540]   You know, obviously that could be a part of it.
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.780]   But when he says, "Preach in the word," he's talking about preach the gospel, to go to
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:31.760]   these villages and these towns and these churches and these synagogues to preach the gospel
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:38.500]   of faith in Christ, the atonement in his blood, to preach that, to preach it in season and
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.500]   out of season.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.860]   You know what that means?
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:45.980]   Whether it's popular or not.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:50.140]   Whether that grows a church or shrinks the church.
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:55.260]   Whether that causes you to have many friends or no friends.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:01.780]   Whether that promotes you to a better job or demotes you to a worse job.
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.580]   That's what it means by in season and out of season.
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:13.340]   The temptation that we have is we want to be bold when it is in season.
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:16.100]   We want to fight when it is in season.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:22.060]   Because who doesn't want to go to work and bring people to Christ and start a Bible study
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.220]   and they thank you for their salvation?
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.660]   Who doesn't want that?
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:29.500]   Who doesn't want to plant the church and see it grow and mature and people thanking you
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.780]   for preaching the gospel in season?
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:36.220]   Who doesn't want to go to foreign lands and bring non-Christians to Christ and see the
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.660]   movement of God and participate in that work?
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:41.340]   Who doesn't want that?
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:48.980]   But from my experience, there are more times when it is not in season than it is in season.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:54.220]   It is when it's not in season where we are tempted to compromise.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:58.100]   It is when it is not in season where we are tempted to quit.
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.740]   It is when it is not in season, when it is not popular, when the church is not growing
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.740]   and people are not thanking you.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:14.900]   Paul is saying, "Preach, preach the same gospel from the same Lord in season and out of season."
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:19.860]   Paul is saying that to Timothy here because it wasn't in season.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:24.060]   There was a season for Paul, which we study in the book of Acts, and we always look at
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:28.220]   the book of Acts and say, "Why can't people be more like the book of Acts?"
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:33.260]   If Christianity was like the book of Acts, Jesus would already be here.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:37.300]   Because everybody would have been converted.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.300]   Everybody would have come to Christ.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.980]   It wouldn't have taken 2,000 years.
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.940]   It was because there's long chunks of seasons where it wasn't in season.
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:49.140]   There's hundreds of years where people were not interested in the gospel.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:53.940]   Decades, years, even in your life.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:58.740]   There are some seasons in your life where you are willing to do anything for Christ,
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:08.300]   and then you hit a dry patch, which is a long period of time, and it's not in season.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.540]   And so we're looking to say, "Well, how can we change this?
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.740]   Is it a better system?
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.260]   Maybe a better man?
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.500]   Maybe a better school?
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.420]   Maybe a better system?"
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:24.500]   And we're trying to change things around so we can be successful.
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:30.180]   But the only thing that God had called us to do is to preach the same gospel from the
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:35.180]   same Lord in season and out of season.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:40.440]   If we're faithful enough, there will come a time when it is in season.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.980]   But our faithfulness is not tested when it is in season.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.580]   Our faithfulness is tested.
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:53.260]   Our faith is tested when it is not in season.
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:43:01.820]   Maybe it's not season in your life now, and you're trying to make it in season.
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:07.700]   You're looking for man to solve your problems.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.260]   You're looking for systems, possibly.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:19.780]   You're thinking, "If you change your circumstance, maybe it'll be in season."
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.380]   Let me read what he says again, verse 12.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:27.780]   "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is the Lord of
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:28.780]   all.
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:35.260]   Bestow on His riches on all who call on Him."
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:43.180]   The challenge, again, I'll get to point three next week, but the challenge for us, as we
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:49.540]   examine our faith, are you calling upon Him?
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:55.020]   And I'm not talking about, "Did you sing this morning?"
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.100]   I'm not talking about, "Did you pray before you ate?"
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:02.780]   I'm not talking about praying with your kids before you go to sleep at night and instilling
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:07.420]   in them a habit of prayer.
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:12.180]   Have you been calling upon the Lord?
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.420]   Consider the height from which we have fallen.
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:24.000]   The same desperate need that we had because you had no answer for your sins.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:33.100]   The same desperateness that you had that brought you to your knees and you cried out, "Abba,
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.980]   Father, forgive me."
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:45.220]   That same desperation that caused you to be justified in your sins is the same desperate
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:49.700]   call that will cause us to be connected.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:55.500]   No man, no amount of man's words, no amount of system, no amount of money, no amount of
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:03.420]   order can take a man's heart that's been hardened and make it into flesh other than the gospel
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.780]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:11.500]   Faith comes from hearing and the hearing of the Word of Christ, not by a system, not by
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:16.740]   change of circumstance, not by joining a group, not by finding the right church, but meeting
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.740]   Christ.
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:26.060]   And that's why he says to believe and to call upon the Lord.
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:32.180]   Have you been just wishful thinking upon the Lord?
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:38.140]   Have you just been silently hoping inwardly in the Lord?
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:42.940]   Have you been looking to other people to somehow change so that you can come to the Lord?
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:49.180]   Are you waiting for somebody to grab your hands and drag you to the Lord?
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:58.300]   The call is to call upon the Lord, to call upon the Lord, to confess Him as Lord and
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.420]   Savior.
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:04.620]   I only know one way.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:11.060]   I only know one way to reconnect with this God.
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:19.940]   I only know one way, is to come to Him in desperate prayer, just like I did when I first
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:23.100]   became a Christian.
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:25.740]   In desperateness.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.020]   Forgive me.
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:31.060]   Forgive me of my heart and heart.
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:34.140]   Forgive me of my worldliness.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.620]   Forgive me for taking you for granted.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:43.340]   Forgive me for keeping you in my back pocket and just taking it out whenever I need you.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:47.860]   Forgive me, Lord, for depending on other people.
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:52.500]   Forgive me for looking for life in vacations.
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:57.340]   Forgive me for finding hope in the future of my children.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:02.420]   Forgive me for being lukewarm and not caring.
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:07.340]   I only know one way to meet this Lord.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:13.140]   In desperateness, to call out to our Father.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:17.380]   One Lord, one faith, one baptism.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:24.940]   I believe with all my heart that the same Holy Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead,
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:27.700]   it dwells in us.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:33.780]   That the same Spirit that gave courage to the Reformers to stand up and even give their
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:41.100]   life to preserve this doctrine, is the same Lord that we are praying to today.
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:46.940]   So I want to encourage you to join me in prayer.
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:50.180]   Join me today.
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:51.180]   Join me tonight.
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:48:00.660]   On Monday, Tuesday morning, Friday night, Saturday, to call upon the Lord.
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:06.380]   I think every single one of you know, because I've had so many conversations with so many
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:11.740]   of you who are discontent with the Christianity that you see around us.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:15.980]   I agree with you.
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.660]   And then what?
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.020]   And then what?
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:25.780]   Are you going to just say it's wrong and throw up your hand?
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.860]   Are you going to just see what's going on and say, "Oh well?"
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.820]   Or is that going to drive you to your knees?
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:41.100]   The only one who can do anything about it, to call upon the name of the Lord and you
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.980]   will be saved.
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:54.540]   Let's take some time as I ask the worship team to come up to pray, to examine our faith.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:57.140]   All that you see around you.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.220]   Have you been complaining to people?
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:02.160]   Have you been looking to things?
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:08.260]   And you've been going to everything and everyone else except Christ.
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:14.780]   Yeah, you and I live in a place in the world where there's hundreds of churches, hundreds
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:20.620]   of services, hundreds of preaching, hundreds of Bible studies in small groups and short-term
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:24.580]   missions, hundreds, maybe even thousands.
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:31.900]   And yet we are so desperate for Christ.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:38.420]   Let's take some time to cry out to the Lord that He may hear us and save us.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:38.660]   Let's pray.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:50:06.640]   Thank you.
