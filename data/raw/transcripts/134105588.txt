[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.440]   At the passage that we're gonna be studying today, chapter 4, verses 14 to 21, I'm gonna
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.360]   read this verse.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.000]   Did you grab a packet for today?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.800]   Okay, there's a packet right at the table in the back.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.800]   There's no more left?
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.800]   Oh, sorry, there's no more left.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.800]   Okay.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.560]   Do you wanna make a call, please?
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.560]   Thanks, Matt.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.560]   All right.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.320]   So let me read this for us, and it says, "I do not write these things to shame you, but
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.600]   to admonish you as my beloved children.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.480]   For if we were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.520]   For in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the gospel.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.280]   Therefore, I exhort you, be imitators of me.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.560]   For this reason, I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.560]   Lord.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.400]   And he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.400]   church.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.800]   Now, some have become arrogant as though I were not coming to you, but I will come to
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.800]   you soon.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.360]   If the Lord wills, and I shall find out, not the words of those who are arrogant, but their
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.360]   power.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.480]   For the kingdom of God does not consist in words, but in power.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.480]   What do you desire?
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.280]   Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?"
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.080]   Okay, let's pray before we jump in.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.080]   Heavenly Father, we wanna thank you again for your precious word.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:45.680]   We pray that as your word continues to examine us, challenge us, and admonish us to diminish
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.360]   our pride and our hearts, to continue to seek harmony within the church.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.480]   I pray, Father Lord, that you would convict us through the spirit.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.120]   And Lord, would you help us to glean much from today's study as Apostle Paul continues
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.560]   to express his heart of ministry and love towards the church.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.280]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.560]   All right.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.560]   Man, sorry if I talk slower today.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.120]   I'm like mega dizzy and like stuffy right here.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.960]   So sometimes I get a little woozy.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.800]   Okay, in looking at the passes that I just read, now I just read it one time through,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.480]   and he's ending, he's ending his long argument about their division and the pride that they
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.600]   have.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.660]   If you look in chapter five, he's going to change the topic and say, "It is actually
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.520]   reported that there is immorality among you," and he is changing the subject, right?
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:53.360]   So in this last section, you would think typically you leave the punch to the very end.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.480]   You leave the emphasis, right?
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.520]   In terms of the argument, a closing statement, so to speak.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.080]   Now I want to ask you, what would be the main argument and reason why the church should
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.680]   no longer be divided in this passage?
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.880]   And more specifically, I think he gives it away in verse 14 through 15.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.840]   Say that one more time.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840]   You are a family.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.920]   Okay, very good.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.560]   What else?
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.280]   Any other thoughts about what this last argument can be?
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:41.960]   Okay, excellent.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.600]   So I like both of those.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   He's been giving various analogies and metaphors about who they are.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.380]   Spiritually here, he sees himself as their spiritual father, right?
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.880]   And there's a sense in which, you know, when you're teaching little kids to do something,
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.560]   you can tell them, "You need to do this because it's good for you.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.760]   You need to do this because the consequences are like this."
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.200]   Sometimes you can tell them, "You need to do this because it hurts them."
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.120]   You know, I tell Yoshi, "You have to be like this.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.240]   I know it seems unfair because otherwise you're hurting your brother."
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.240]   But there are times when I will say, "You need to listen to me because I'm Appa, because
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.100]   I'm your father."
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:30.180]   And although that used improperly would be just simply an abuse of power, but used properly,
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.860]   it makes absolute sense.
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.820]   Apostle Paul is essentially saying there's a great difference between, let's say, some
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.660]   random guy trying to write you a letter to correct you, as opposed to me, I've stayed
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.700]   with you for many years, or about two years.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.940]   I've appealed to you.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.940]   I've loved you.
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.940]   I've shared with you.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.340]   I've taught you.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.500]   Apostle Paul has sacrificed everything for this church.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.260]   And so in this last one, he's telling them, "I'm speaking to you as a father.
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.820]   I'm speaking to you as a father."
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.740]   So let's take a dive in and take a look at more closely, then as a father, what are the
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.500]   things that Apostle Paul is doing for the church and why should they listen?
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:18.020]   Well, in verse 14, we'll get these words, "I do not write these things to you to shame
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.660]   you, but to admonish you as my beloved children."
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.940]   And the first question I want to ask is, if you were to take that first verse and use
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:39.620]   that as almost like a purpose statement for the letter, how would you summarize that?
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.460]   I know it's already a short verse, and you're like, "Huh, you're almost asking a summary
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.020]   of a summary statement."
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.220]   But sometimes it's good to put things in our own words.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.420]   We do that a lot when we're studying, right?
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.980]   Because that way we're kind of grasping, "Hey, this is in many ways the purpose statement
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.980]   of the whole letter."
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.980]   Okay?
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.980]   So just try.
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.980]   Yes?
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.900]   I write this because I love you and it's good for you.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.900]   Excellent.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.220]   I write this because I love you and it's good for you.
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.220]   What else?
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.740]   Dude, I'm so sorry.
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.740]   My mind blanked.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.740]   What was your name again?
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.740]   Jonathan.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.740]   Jonathan.
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.740]   Sorry.
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.740]   I talked with him forever the last week.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.740]   I can't believe I'm like this.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.340]   Anyway.
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.340]   Any other summaries?
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:29.340]   It's to admonish as a father to his son.
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.340]   Okay.
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.940]   I'm writing to admonish as a father to his son.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.940]   Excellent.
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.940]   Okay?
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.260]   So this is the tone of the whole letter.
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.140]   I mean, as in the whole book, you know?
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:47.540]   What Apostle Paul is admonishing, correcting, but he's doing it in the context of a relationship
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.940]   where he is their father and he loves them.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.940]   Okay?
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:57.380]   So just from this short verse, what applications can we draw about correcting or admonishing
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:03.180]   someone?
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:13.020]   How about Christine Cha?
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.020]   One more time?
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.020]   Okay.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.020]   Great.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:23.540]   To do it out of genuine care and to the best of that person, right?
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.700]   To benefit that individual.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.980]   Absolutely.
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:35.020]   If you look at that, there's a little last phrase, "as my beloved children."
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:41.740]   You know, I really love it when the writers, whether it's Apostle Paul or other writers,
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.260]   they start writing to the church as their truly beloved.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.260]   You know?
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:53.820]   I remember John, as he's writing, he's an individual who writes of love a lot.
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.580]   And it's pretty astounding because the way that the writers are seeing the church, they're
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.580]   not seeing them as like, "You are my soldiers and I must break you."
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.580]   You know?
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.220]   They're not seeing them like, "You are my minions," or "You are my disciples, so do
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:13.740]   what your teacher says," which in that culture, they could.
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.620]   That's a culture where they had, what, slaves and masters.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.860]   That's a culture where hierarchy amongst older people and younger people and people of stature
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.500]   and people of low income status was really, really different.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.100]   But the way that Apostle Paul and the different authors of the Bible speak to the church is
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.700]   one of deep, deep love and care.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:40.860]   And then, you know, all the commentaries made note of the fact that that term, "as my beloved
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.140]   children," is interestingly written.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.460]   You guys have heard many, many times that there are different words for love.
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.140]   There's phileo, which is like brotherly love, and there's different types of love.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.660]   This one is the agape love.
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:09:00.140]   There is this unconditional, "I will go to any length to serve you, to do good for you,"
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.380]   in the term agape.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:07.700]   There is this commitment, unconditional commitment for your good in that term, agape.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.860]   And so, all the things that Apostle Paul says, even the things that, remember in the last
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.300]   couple weeks, he was getting all sarcastic with them.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.780]   He was like, "You guys are kings and I'm just a, you know, lollipopper and you guys are
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.260]   wise and I must be stupid."
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.980]   You know, he's getting all sarcastic.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.460]   But even sometimes that harsh tone, it exists in the care.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.140]   It exists in the fatherly love.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.140]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.140]   Okay.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.860]   What else?
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:41.380]   What else can we derive just from that short statement, or short phrase, verse 14?
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.380]   Yes.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.380]   John?
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.380]   >> Sometimes love hurts.
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.380]   >> Okay.
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.380]   Sometimes love hurts.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.380]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:57.660]   But we should still do the things that are necessary, right?
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:06.860]   So he mentions this idea of, over here, this whole idea of, "I don't necessarily want to
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.140]   shame you, but I am going to admonish you."
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.140]   You know?
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.300]   And that correction and admonishing is going to be painful.
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.820]   When he says, "I don't want to shame you," we do have to think about this principle,
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.980]   like if we're ever in a position, let's say, sometimes on the line, you're a small group
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:27.380]   leader or just one-to-one, you have a younger brother or sister in Christ that you need
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.660]   to correct, that you need to admonish, right?
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.740]   You definitely never want to shame them.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.520]   You never want to humiliate them.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.780]   You never want to make them feel like, "Oh, I'm just getting pressed so hard that essentially
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.860]   I'm broken here," you know?
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:48.380]   There's a sense in which it's not our job to break somebody.
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.700]   The breaking is going to happen by their own conviction in the Spirit to the truth of the
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.940]   Lord.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:59.300]   It's our job to give them and admonish them in the capacity God has given us, according
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.300]   to His Word.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.660]   And so he says, "I don't mean to shame you, but what I do mean is to admonish you."
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:11.020]   And that is one of the key terms that I want to talk about.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:16.540]   Admonish in the Greek is "nuthetaio," and it literally means "to put into mind."
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.620]   To put into mind.
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.780]   So I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard about biblical counseling or nuthetic counseling,
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:30.980]   and the whole premise behind that approach to counseling is to say, "We're going to reason
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:36.780]   from the Scriptures and change the way an individual thinks, what the individual believes,
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.440]   the attitude of the heart needs to change."
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.260]   That's at the base or the foundation of that nuthetic counseling.
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:49.340]   And so, from that term, there is a principle to be learned.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.980]   I loved it when an older gentleman taught me this principle and said, "You know, when
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:12:00.700]   you're trying to help people change, you have to make them see the wisdom in it.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.340]   You have to make them see the wisdom of what you're doing.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:09.060]   I mean, you can sit here and just be like, 'Come on, come on,' and really, really just
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:14.040]   kind of cheer them on and whatnot, but if they don't rationally, if they don't in truth
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.420]   see the wisdom in what they're doing, they might be performing for you, they might temporarily
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:24.140]   be appeasing you, but there's a sense in which a lasting, permanent change might not happen
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.060]   until they see the wisdom of what they do."
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:33.700]   So, with the term admonish, it has with it the idea that he purposed to bring about a
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.080]   change in their belief and understanding, right?
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.580]   And that's why you see in a letter, you see a letter where he's making arguments upon
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.820]   arguments upon arguments.
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.780]   You know what I mean?
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:53.240]   So far, again, in that first verse, we learn a lot just about, one, what did Apostle Paul
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:59.580]   purpose in his heart, and two, applicationally, how do we go about admonishing or correcting
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.580]   people?
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.580]   Okay?
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.580]   I want to ask you this question, though.
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.320]   It's a yes or no question.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:13.500]   Is it our job as a Christian to admonish fellow Christians?
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.500]   Yes or no?
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.500]   Yes?
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.500]   Okay.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:21.780]   Well, to, this is one of those trick ones.
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.900]   That's why even though it's a yes or no one, I put it in here.
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.420]   In one sense, yes, absolutely.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.260]   Galatians chapter six, verse one through two.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.940]   Brethren, even if, you know what?
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:35.940]   Let me have some of you guys read this.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.140]   I'm going to save my voice here.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.980]   Patrick, can you read Galatians six?
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.980]   Really loud.
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.980]   - Brethren, watch the law.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.580]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:59.460]   I'm going to have, how about, Mark Barless, can you read the Ezekiel passage?
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:16.420]   - When I say to the wicked, you will surely die if you do not work and speak out for more
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.880]   if he does not turn from the wickedness, or from the wicked way,
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.880]   he shall die and be forgiven, but He has delivered himself.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.080]   Again, when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits a wicked deed,
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.420]   and commits an obstacle before it, he will die.
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.840]   Since you have not warned him that he shall die in sin and his righteous deeds which he has done,
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.160]   he shall not be remembered, but his blood I will require in your hand.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:42.340]   However, if you have warned the righteous man that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin,
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.880]   he shall surely live because he has been warned, and you have delivered yourself.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.920]   Okay, so those passages are pretty clear.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.260]   Like, if you're spiritual, and someone's sinning, then you who are spiritual,
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.080]   you need to restore the person with gentleness.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.960]   In Ezekiel passage, if you see somebody and they're acting wickedly,
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.880]   you need to speak them warning, otherwise their blood is on your hands.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.760]   Right?
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:10.540]   So very clearly, those two passages teach us you need to admonish the people around you.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:15.200]   And so, I want us to think about that a little bit.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.000]   Basically, the reason why I say it wasn't as a clear-cut yes or no is because
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.380]   there is kind of a balancing of two things, right?
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:31.540]   For example, if you don't know a person, you don't want to just go to them in the vision and be like,
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.960]   "You did that wrong."
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.420]   It's like, "Who are you?"
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.540]   You know?
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.580]   And also, in humility, you realize, "I don't see everything.
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:43.540]   I don't see the person's, like, the surrounding circumstance, the person's intention."
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:49.080]   So there's, on one end of the spectrum, there is, you should be careful about how you admonish people.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.920]   But on the other side of the spectrum, if you don't admonish people,
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.580]   then you're also not heeding what God has implemented into the community of Christ.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.700]   Right?
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:04.500]   And there's a sense in which we're really not doing God and His truth,
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:10.080]   or giving God and His truth the kind of honor that it deserves.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.840]   Where we are all together so submitted to the will of the Lord,
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.340]   that we are all together and one another admonishing each other to submit unto that.
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.380]   Right?
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.660]   So, again, there is a balancing of the two.
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:26.120]   And then verse 15 and 16, to me, is that kind of balancing.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.540]   Or 15 and 16, yeah.
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.340]   Of the kind of balancing of what he's saying.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.080]   What I mean by that is this.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.460]   In verse 15, he says, "For if you were to have countless fathers in Christ,
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.040]   that you would not have many fathers.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:42.160]   For in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the gospel."
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.380]   Okay?
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.540]   Now, it could be pretty plain what he means by this.
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.200]   But let me ask you, what do you think he means by saying,
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.920]   "I became your father through the gospel"?
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.160]   Is he thinking about quality of care, like, "I care for you as a father"?
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.540]   Is he thinking about just, like, numerically,
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.000]   "There's only one dad, I'm your one dad"?
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.880]   What's he saying?
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.420]   Hmm.
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.620]   Okay, so my relationship to you is one as father to son,
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.300]   and so I have the authority over you.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.660]   What else?
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.700]   How did he become a father to them?
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.660]   Yes.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.880]   Excellent.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:32.800]   So, more specifically, I do think he does have that relationship as an apostle,
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.040]   where he has authority over the church.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.000]   Essentially planting the church.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.660]   But more specifically, he is the one who brought them to Christ.
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:44.460]   So he is literally their spiritual father, right, through the gospel.
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:49.160]   And so there's a sense here where he is talking about the various things
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.800]   that I kind of mentioned, the quality of care,
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.960]   numerically there's one father.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.960]   He's saying, "There can be a lot of people who kind of tutor you,
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.160]   but there is one spiritual father, and I became that father to you."
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.040]   Right?
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.280]   And so he's kind of saying, like, "Through that experience,
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.840]   I'm so closely tied to you."
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:13.620]   You know, there's a sense in which, can I become a father to anybody?
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.000]   In a functional sense, I can adopt and become their father.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.040]   But in a biological sense, I can only become a father by actually,
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.840]   you know, going through the natural process.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.660]   Right?
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:34.620]   And what's really interesting to me is that that tie of being a biological father
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.840]   will make fathers go above and beyond.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.200]   What do I mean by that?
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:46.040]   So, you know, when I was working at this academy back in Cerritos,
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.880]   what the academy did was they hosted a bunch of these children from Guatemala.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.500]   And these children were super cute.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.320]   They were Koreans who lived in Guatemala and grew up there,
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.160]   and they came over, and then these host families would essentially
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.120]   parrot them for almost two months.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.620]   Okay?
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.960]   Now, you know what's really interesting is a lot of the host families
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.840]   were Christian parents.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.540]   But sadly to say, do you think the host parents treated their
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.040]   biological kids the same as the Guatemalan kids?
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.500]   Mm-mm.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.240]   What's really interesting is biological children, they'll do stuff like buy them
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.200]   cars, they'll do stuff like drive them, like, everywhere and anywhere.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   They'll pay.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.400]   That academy was not cheap.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.640]   It was like 500 bucks a month.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.900]   500 bucks a month, are you crazy?
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.700]   And these were Korean parents, so they don't want to lose a dollar, you know?
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.500]   But for their biological kids, they would go above and beyond.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.940]   So what's weird to me and interesting to me is that tie and connection will make
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.460]   parents go to any length.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.460]   And you guys know that.
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.620]   Your parents will go any length.
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.620]   You need money?
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.620]   Okay.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.620]   You need this?
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.620]   Okay.
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.620]   You need that?
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.620]   Okay.
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.620]   Education?
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.620]   No problem.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.620]   That's the way biological parents are.
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.620]   You're a biological father.
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.340]   I'm connected to you in this way.
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.620]   And there's a verse that I jotted down for you there.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.820]   Mitchell, can you read that?
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.800]   Second Corinthians 12, 14 through 15.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   It speaks his heart towards the church.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.800]   Here for the third time, I am ready to come to you.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.800]   I will not be a burden to you, for I do not seek what is yours from you.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.800]   Your children are not responsible to save up for their parents, but parents for their
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   children.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   I will most gladly spend and be expended for your soul.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   If I love you more, I will be the one to love you more.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   I will be a blessing to you.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   There is a difference.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.280]   There is a difference from a tutor to a parent.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.800]   There is a difference between a babysitter and a parent.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.240]   There is a difference between a hired hand, as Jesus would say, and the true shepherd.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:07.000]   And Apostle Paul is saying that I have this heart towards you.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.800]   So earlier I asked, is it our job to admonish?
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   Yes.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.640]   But we have to always remember that job to admonish exists in the context of love.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.640]   Right?
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.720]   If we're not willing to expend ourselves and go the extra step, if we're not willing
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:28.040]   to help them by way of X, Y, and Z, and yet all we want to do is drop them the bomb and
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:32.240]   give them a rock or something and say, here, take it.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.400]   I don't think we're doing what the Bible calls us to do.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.400]   Right?
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:43.560]   So by application, that little blank is just simply, we should all have a heart of a loving
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.800]   parent.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.760]   Now obviously we're not going to be treating each other like, oh, you're my little kid,
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.640]   you know, because then that's going to be taken as very prideful too.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.800]   It's like, you're not my dad, you know?
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.200]   But there is a sense that every person that you see and you want to minister to, you want
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.840]   to look at them like a parent.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.720]   If they, whatever they need, I'm willing to supply.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.600]   If they need a rebuking, then I will supply rebuking.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.360]   If they need encouragement and soft comfort, then I'm going to provide soft comfort and
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.960]   encouragement, whatever they need.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.960]   That's the heart of a parent.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.400]   Okay?
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.400]   Verse 16.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:30.680]   In verse 16, he says, "Therefore I exhort you, be imitators of me."
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:37.240]   And so you can see him again, therefore, what is the basis of his exhortation?
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.320]   It says fatherly love.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.800]   But then he says, be imitators of me.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.960]   Okay?
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.440]   And I don't know if I blanked it out, I'm supposed to.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.240]   The imitators in the Greek is the word where we get the word mimic.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.880]   Literally copy after me.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.240]   Do what I do.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.240]   Okay?
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.640]   Which is quite profound if you think about it.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.760]   And I definitely hope that as I parent my own kids, I could tell them, do what I do.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.240]   Like, follow Appa.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.740]   Follow how Appa treats your mom.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.520]   Follow how Appa treats your brother.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.880]   Follow how Appa is hardworking.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.840]   Follow how Appa is prayerful.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.800]   I hope that my character would be one where I can tell my kids, follow Appa.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.800]   You know?
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.240]   And Apostle Paul essentially is saying that.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.720]   But I think when he says that, when he says this interesting term, mimic me, again, a
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:33.600]   lot of criticism has been given to churches and Christian faith because there's a sense
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.760]   in which some people don't like this idea of mimic somebody.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.920]   Are we producing clones?
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.920]   You know?
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.240]   Are we producing replicas?
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.800]   And we're supposed to do exactly, everybody the same way and we're supposed to follow
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   suit?
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.120]   Well, obviously this is, he's not saying in every little thing I do, you know?
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.360]   He's not saying his temperament and everything.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.120]   But in the things that are truly spiritual.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.560]   But in thinking about that, I think it teaches us something about discipleship.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.440]   Let me ask you this question.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:10.600]   By Apostle Paul saying, mimic me, what does that teach us about discipleship in general?
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:17.280]   Either like a method or a principle in discipleship?
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.360]   Yes.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.800]   Right.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.720]   Not just words, but lifestyle.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.720]   Absolutely.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:34.880]   There's a sense in which there is a difference between challenging others directly and challenging
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.800]   others indirectly.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:46.400]   And you have to realize at Berean, we give people opportunities to serve and to challenge
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.440]   others through their faith.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:53.000]   And obviously in terms of teaching, teaching the Bible, we hold that as like, you have
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.960]   to be really qualified.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.960]   But every single one of us can indirectly be discipling others.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.960]   Why?
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.560]   Through our own dedication, through our own commitment, through our own self-evaluation
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:11.520]   and through our own sanctification, we're constantly discipling others.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.520]   You won't believe how many times I've been inspired and discipled indirectly by just
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.520]   watching people.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.360]   So if you ever see me just staring at you, it's not because you have something on your
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.360]   face.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.360]   It's because I do that a lot.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.600]   I kind of watch people and like, wow.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.940]   You know, when people are doing things in the background.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.040]   Because that's the kind of way I operate too.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.160]   I always watch that.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.400]   And I get inspired.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.880]   I get totally inspired.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:41.200]   So again, Apostle Paul in his exhortation, he commands them or he exhorts them to be
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.200]   imitators.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:47.520]   And in verse 17 he says, "For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.120]   and faithful child in the Lord.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:55.480]   And he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everyone in every
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.480]   church."
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.360]   Okay?
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:06.680]   So earlier Christine Cha mentioned about the kind of aim that somebody has.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:12.800]   Apostle Paul says here that for this reason I have sent you Timothy.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.920]   I just kind of, in studying I saw different views from different commentaries.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.120]   So I put this question in there.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.000]   It's not necessarily like a profound one or whatever.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.800]   But he says, "For this reason I sent to you Timothy."
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.680]   Is this the same reason in verse 16 where he says, "Therefore I exhort you."
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.000]   Or is this a different reason?
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.880]   What do you think?
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:49.280]   Some options are, was it his fatherly love that he sent Timothy?
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.920]   Was it for the reason of mimicking Apostle Paul?
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:59.000]   Was it for the reason of practically obeying what he taught?
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:09.720]   What was the reason?
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.720]   All of the above.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.320]   I guess you can say all of the above, huh?
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.080]   I feel like your answers are typically like that.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.760]   Is it this or that?
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.760]   Both.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:19.760]   That's cool though.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.480]   You know, actually, I mean, I guess it could be.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:28.520]   I don't think we have to decide, okay, it's exclusively one or the other.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:35.320]   But does anybody have a ... Because of his fatherly love.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.320]   Any other guesses?
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.800]   Or why would you say it's because of his fatherly love?
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:28:02.360]   Well, it comes right after ... It was interviewing verse about ... Just before that, it only
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:26.600]   came after he sent Timothy because he's already about to imitate him.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.600]   And so then the most immediately preceding thing that makes sense to refer to is, I became
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.600]   your father in Christ Jesus, who you got from.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.600]   Okay, gotcha.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   Just distance.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   Okay, just distance.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:36.800]   So, Paul's a Paul in everything that he's doing, from admonishing, loving, being a father
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.880]   and whatnot, exhorting.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.600]   He's doing all those things because he's motivated by his fatherly love.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   So even in sending Timothy, can it be because he's motivated by his fatherly love?
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.600]   Absolutely.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.160]   But I guess I personally took it more on the side.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:59.800]   I basically took one of the commentaries' position and said, he says, "For this reason,
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:07.040]   I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:13.400]   you of the ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church."
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:19.320]   So I took it more to mean, Timothy is sent for a very specific purpose, to remind you
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:26.000]   of my ways, the way I did things, the way I taught you, how I taught you to obey, how
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.920]   I taught you to behave and function in the church.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.080]   So I took it to mean that when he says, "For this reason," and the reason is for your mimicking
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:38.000]   of Apostle Paul, for your spiritual growth and practicality in the expression of your
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.840]   faith being portrayed in your deeds, I'm sending you Timothy.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.880]   Now there are other portions of scripture that speak.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:58.560]   For example, in 3 John, John says, "I have no greater joy than this, to hear my children
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.840]   walking in the truth."
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:05.520]   In Galatians 4, 19, Apostle Paul says, "My children, with whom I am in labor until Christ
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.800]   is formed in you."
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:15.720]   So earlier, Christine said, "To be a father, to be someone who truly loves an individual,
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.600]   you have their spiritual best in your sight all the time."
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.200]   He's kind of discouraged because Apostle Paul is like continuing to love them and the
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:29.120]   church is continuing to doubt his apostleship.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:34.960]   But the fact of the matter is, Apostle Paul still nonetheless had their spiritual good
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.520]   in mind at all times.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.840]   And what is their spiritual good?
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.400]   To be in line with the will of God.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.440]   To mature from their sin of pride, which is one of the greatest that is taught to us in
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.480]   the Bible.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:56.040]   And so I think there's a sense in which Apostle Paul, in sending Timothy, he's still pursuing
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:02.160]   that goal of causing these Christians in Corinth to mature.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:08.080]   And so he's going to give an exhortation about that aspect, where faith needs to be mature
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.960]   to action.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.960]   Next verses.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:22.800]   In verse 18 he says, "Now some have become arrogant as though I weren't coming to you."
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:28.800]   We know that Apostle Paul was battling arrogance, you know, because arrogantly they're saying,
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.720]   "I'm of Paul, I'm of Apollos, you know, I'm of Cephas."
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:37.040]   And they're kind of having this like, "I'm better than you because of who taught me,"
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.800]   kind of thing.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:44.520]   But can you try to think of why Apostle Paul would call them arrogant?
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:50.320]   Is it because it's arrogant to think Apostle Paul won't come?
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:57.880]   Is it arrogant, you know, why call them arrogant at this point?
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:22.880]   Like, I guess, what's the arrogance that Apostle Paul is, you know, pinpointing here?
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.880]   Yes?
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:52.880]   [inaudible]
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:33:03.080]   There you go.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.920]   I think I agree with what Mitchell is saying.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.960]   What's, I guess, funny, and not necessarily funny, but what's interesting about this scenario
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:17.160]   is did the Corinthian church think they were spiritually mature?
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.160]   They didn't.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.040]   They actually thought they were the opposite.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.920]   They thought they were spiritually elevated.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.080]   And I think there's an element in which they were definitely going above and beyond, and
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:31.160]   because they thought Apostle Paul wasn't coming, Mitchell said, "They end up saying whatever
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.160]   they want."
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.160]   You know?
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.400]   So, good, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.240]   They end up saying whatever they want.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:43.480]   They end up saying stuff and there's no consequences to it because they don't think Apostle Paul
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.480]   is coming.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:49.280]   There is this attitude of, "I'm going to say and do what I want."
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.280]   All right?
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:57.280]   And I think we never verbalize that in our lives.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.280]   You know?
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.800]   Like, "I'm just going to do whatever I want."
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.160]   But we do that a lot, don't we?
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.640]   People might advise us one way or the other.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.100]   People might, you know, kind of direct us and guide us with good counsel, but a lot
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.160]   of times we do what in the end?
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:15.600]   We do what we want, even if someone's trying to teach you the other way.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   Why?
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:21.120]   Because there's this attitude in us, deep in us, an element of pride that says, "I'm
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.480]   going to do what I want."
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.480]   Right?
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.760]   And I think that's the kind of idea that he's getting at here.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:31.880]   In verse 19 through 20, oh, sorry, I wanted to tell you about the story of Eli and his
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.480]   sons.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:39.760]   The story of Eli and his sons are a pretty sad story because Eli is actually seen as
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.240]   a very good prophet.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:51.840]   But there's a marr in the story, there's a bad attribute to his character because of
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.720]   his sons.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:59.680]   And what happens is, his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, they end up doing whatever they
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.200]   want within the temple.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:06.200]   And the thing about it is, they not only just do whatever they want, they do things that
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.680]   are completely egregious to the Lord.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.980]   Things like, people come to the sanctuary to offer sacrifices, right?
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.400]   So they swindle them.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.280]   Ladies come to the sanctuary to offer sacrifices, right?
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.600]   So they have sexually immoral relationships with them.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.760]   They were opening up the sanctuary doors, the temple doors, to all kinds of sin and
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.060]   rank immorality.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:34.720]   And so, these two brothers needed to be rebuked, but their attitude was, "We do what we want."
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.720]   What's crazy about this whole scenario is, Eli is judged for that.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.920]   It's like, "Whoa, wait a minute.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.360]   Hophni and Phinehas were the two sons who were wicked."
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:50.040]   Yes, but God, if you read the story, God rebukes Eli.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:55.160]   And there's an element in which, by allowing sin and his sons to do whatever they want
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:36:00.600]   and not stemming their pride, Eli was again, guilty too.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:07.760]   And there's a sense in which we can say, when an individual sees sin, but they do not address
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:14.200]   it, there is always a case in which you honor man more than God.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.160]   Eli then might be guilty of honoring his sons more than the Lord.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:27.320]   So I bring that story up because Apostle Paul essentially says, "I'm not letting you get
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.240]   away with your sins."
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:35.040]   He says in verse 19, "But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I shall find
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.760]   out not the words of those who are arrogant, but their power.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:46.720]   For the kingdom of God does not consist in words, but in power."
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.480]   Now you see a contrast.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.960]   The kingdom of God does not consist in words, but in power.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.400]   That's a general principle.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.400]   I love it when he gives universal truth.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.680]   The kingdom of God is like this.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.960]   It's not of words, but of power.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.880]   That's really interesting.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:25.800]   What does power represent as he's contrasting these two things, words and power?
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.840]   What do you think that power represents?
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:58.680]   I guess more specifically, what is he comparing?
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.600]   Power of the Spirit to do what God wants.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.240]   Yes, Eugene.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:30.600]   [Audience member asks question]
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:56.400]   Okay.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:02.240]   So far we have one, power as in, I'm going to call that supernatural power.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.280]   Supernatural in the sense that maybe God has invested in the apostles power and authority
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.200]   to actually do something.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:15.800]   Then we also have power as in the Holy Spirit's moving in us to do the will of the Lord.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   Like that?
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   Okay.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   Good.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   Okay.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:25.540]   So in thinking about this, let's, as we take a look at this verse again.
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:31.560]   He says, "I shall find out not the words of those who are arrogant, but their power."
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:36.340]   So Eugene, I'd have to disagree with yours, but if you look at it, he's talking about
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.040]   power in them, not necessarily power in himself.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.320]   So actually I like what David said.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:51.840]   There's that repeated many times in scripture difference between power just in words as
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:58.200]   in faith that's seen only in doctrine as opposed to true spiritual power that's found in the
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.760]   transformed life.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.760]   Okay.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.440]   Let me repeat that again.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.840]   In the Bible, there is a repeated theme.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840]   Okay.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:14.160]   A repeated theme where faith that exists in words and doctrine is contrasted with the
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.280]   power of a transformed life.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.040]   Okay.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:24.280]   And so the principle, we're trying to think about this for a moment, for the kingdom of
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.680]   God does not consist in words, but in power.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.680]   Okay.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.800]   So he tells them, I'm going to examine you.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.960]   Okay.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:37.640]   I'm going to examine your words and I'm going to see if there's real power.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.080]   As in I'm going to examine both what you're saying and what you're doing.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.080]   Right.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.960]   I'm going to examine you thoroughly.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.960]   Words and deeds.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.960]   Okay.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:50.320]   And then he gives this principle, the kingdom of God, kingdom of God that relates to what?
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.320]   Genuine salvation.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:56.000]   That it relates to the eternal kingdom, the kingdom in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.160]   It consists not of words, but in power.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:04.600]   Jesus said in Matthew 7 verse 21, not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord will enter the
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:11.960]   kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my father who is in heaven will enter.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.400]   Right.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.640]   So Christ himself is giving a clear principle.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.720]   There's going to be so many of you who are going to with words say, Lord, Lord, you know,
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.400]   I'm with Jesus.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:29.600]   I'm a Christian, but he says, but they're not going to, they're going to be sorely disappointed.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.600]   Why?
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.640]   Because the kingdom of heaven does not consist of those who only have power in words, but
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:40.600]   it's going to be the spiritually transformed life of those who do the will of the father.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.600]   Okay.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:48.200]   So true spiritual power is seen not in their boastful words, but it's seen in their transformed
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.200]   living.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.200]   Why is he saying this?
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.320]   Why is he saying this?
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:58.120]   Because apostle Paul wants to see tangible change.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.740]   Okay.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.640]   Apostle Paul doesn't want to see like, here's an exhortation and then them to just agree,
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.440]   you're right, you're right.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.360]   And then they turn around and go on sinning.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.680]   Apostle Paul doesn't want to see this kind of like mental acceptance of what he's saying
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:17.360]   without the actual life transformation that he's, he's actually expecting from them.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.360]   Right?
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:23.960]   Likewise for us, there's a thing to be said like, you know, in the many ways that we grow
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:28.520]   in our Bible knowledge and the many ways that we grow in our knowledge of the Lord, these
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:36.160]   things have to have to be coupled with transformative living, like actual tangible change in the
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.040]   way that we function, think and do things in our lives.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.240]   And I want to challenge us.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:47.200]   If there's some of you who feel, who feel like you've hit what are so-called plateaus,
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:53.720]   which again, I believe technically they don't exist because in a relationship you're either
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.900]   growing really, really far or growing really, really close.
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.520]   But there are times in our spiritual lives we go to the same Bible studies and church
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.960]   services for like a number of years.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:09.240]   And there's kind of almost a sense in which, Hmm, I'm not sure if there is this purposeful,
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:14.040]   tangible, goal oriented living in my life right now.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:19.560]   And my question to you is, has anything changed in the last several years?
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:24.680]   You know, if you've heard exhortation to go, go like share the gospel at work, has anything
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.640]   actually changed?
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.860]   If you know, you've heard exhortation to diminish your entertainment consumption and spend more
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:35.880]   time and consume consuming the word of the Lord and prayer, has anything actually changed?
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.920]   If you've been exhorted and challenged to Bible studies to, you know, to reach out to
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.280]   brothers and sisters, get to know them, ask them good questions, learn who they are, and
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.480]   then minister to them if at all possible.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.640]   Has anything changed in your circle of friends?
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:53.240]   I think there's a sense in which the power, the spiritual power that Apostle Paul wants
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:58.360]   to see again is the spiritual power of transformed living.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.360]   Okay.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.400]   So I don't know.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.840]   Some of us have been really steadily growing and we've seen just radical changes in our
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.120]   lives and some of us change is slow, which is fine.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.200]   But again, I want to ask you this question.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.400]   Tangibly speaking, have things changed in the last several years?
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:19.040]   And if they haven't, then yeah, you're going to end up feeling like, man, I'm not really
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   like driven right now.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.040]   I'm not really goal.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.160]   Like there isn't a goal that I'm pursuing.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.840]   You know, there isn't an attachment of the things that I do with my life to what God
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.240]   really wants and the will of the Lord, you know?
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:37.760]   So lastly, in verse 21, okay, what do you desire?
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.960]   He's kind of asking like, what will it be?
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:40.960]   Huh?
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:47.440]   And he says, shall I come with you with a rod or with love and a gentle spirit?
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.120]   His tone suddenly changes and he speaks almost in a threatening way.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.360]   He says, what's it going to be?
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.360]   Right?
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:59.920]   And I ask this question, as he says this, as he says this statement and asks the church
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:06.080]   this question, what does this say about apostle Paul and how he viewed them?
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:17.720]   You know, we've been talking about it so far that he's viewing them as a father, you know,
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:21.960]   but just think about the question for a moment.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:30.880]   It is weird that he kind of ends the letter in this basically threat, you know?
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:31.880]   Think about it.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:47.360]   How does apostle Paul view them?
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:51.120]   You guys can leave that as one of your discussion questions, you know?
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:56.640]   But can we learn about how apostle Paul viewed his relationship with the church and how he
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.320]   viewed the church, you know?
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.040]   All right.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:09.400]   So today, really, to summarize, apostle Paul exhorts them to cease from this division and
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.280]   pride and he says multiple things.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:17.720]   I admonish you, I exhort you, I'm going to come and examine you, but in the end he says,
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.840]   I'm doing all this stuff because I'm your father, because I love you, right?
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:27.440]   I'm saying all this stuff to you not to shame you, complete opposite.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:32.160]   I'm doing the hard stuff because I completely love you as a father with a son, right?
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.600]   I think that's pretty amazing and it challenges us to think about the way we view the people
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.600]   around us.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:42.960]   It challenges us to think about the way we encourage and exhort people around us too.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.360]   All right.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.840]   Let's pray and wrap up today's study.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:56.320]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you that you have used such men as apostle Paul.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:04.760]   Lord, we have at our church many people who love the church so much more than themselves.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:10.220]   We have so many people in the church who are willing to expend themselves and literally
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:14.800]   die to themselves rather than to see the church hurt or suffer.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:20.520]   I thank you Father God that you have placed such men in the life of the church, Lord.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:26.160]   I pray Father God that we all would be challenged, that we all would be challenged to change
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.160]   in our lives.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:33.760]   God, that we might have true spiritual power and not just in word and doctrine.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:40.240]   I pray also Father Lord that you would use us to admonish, to exhort, to comfort and
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.220]   to love the people around us, Lord.
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:48.380]   As you have called the church to be truly a body that's so connected as a family, I
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:51.840]   pray Lord that that would be fulfilled in our church here.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.840]   Thank you in Christ's name.
