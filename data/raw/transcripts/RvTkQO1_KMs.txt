[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.940]   It's VDWaltz, right?
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.020]   How long does it typically take to warm up?
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.940]   - We're live now, my bad.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.940]   - We're live, okay.
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.700]   Well, hello everybody at home.
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.380]   I'm glad that we could gather together in these small groups
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.620]   to fellowship, to share in a meal and spend time together.
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.180]   It's been a great Sunday, the Lord's Day,
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.020]   having service together and then being able to,
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.900]   again, spend extended time.
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.760]   And so tonight we're gonna be spending time in worship,
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.100]   we're gonna be hearing a brief encouragement
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.580]   and spending some time sharing.
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.740]   So at this time, please join me in a word of prayer
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.140]   as we begin this time.
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.920]   Heavenly Father, we are grateful.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.880]   And God, I pray that our church,
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.520]   we would be a people so considerate and thoughtful of you.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.320]   Meaning God, that we remember and know
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.800]   truly what it is we have in Christ.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.800]   God, that above and beyond any blessing in this earth,
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.320]   we have the blessings of the Lord,
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.600]   we have the blessings of Christ and of the Spirit.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.340]   And I pray that our hearts would be thankful always
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.080]   according to your will.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.800]   And Lord, as we have time now to gather together
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.600]   in these groups, we pray that we would be very aware
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.200]   of the fact that all of this is possible
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.720]   because of our Lord.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.520]   And God, that our hearts would be overjoyed
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.760]   to be able to enjoy this time and also to remember you.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.840]   So God, we lift our heart of gratitude to you this evening.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.020]   It's in Christ and we pray, amen.

[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.080]   We wanted to be intentional
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.080]   with what we are doing this evening.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.080]   And I know, you know, you guys,
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.080]   hopefully you had a opportunity to eat your food
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.080]   and you're resting.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.080]   But again, we wanted to be intentional
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.080]   with the time that we have.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.080]   I just heard before I came up here,
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.080]   there's about 29 different groups spread out in the region.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.080]   And I know some of you guys are very sick.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.080]   Shout out to the Johns.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   Yeah, they had a home group over there
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.080]   and they had to kind of spread out
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.080]   because their family's not doing well.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.080]   And I know other people who are home
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.080]   because you guys are not doing well.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.080]   But hopefully you guys can enjoy the time together.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.080]   Let me pray for us.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.080]   And then I wanna give a short devotion
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.080]   so that we can have some time
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.080]   of intentional discussion afterwards.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.080]   All right, let's pray.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.080]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.080]   for the blessing that you've given our community
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:15.080]   that we can gather together in homes, in various places
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.080]   to share a meal, to break bread,
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.080]   to give thanks, Lord God,
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:24.080]   for your grace and love that you pour upon us.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.080]   I pray that you would bless this time.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.080]   And as we have heard your word this morning,
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.080]   and as we will be reminded again, Father God,
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   of who you are, help us, Lord,
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.080]   to truly have an attitude of gratitude
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.080]   in all that we have.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.080]   Bless this time, bless your word.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.080]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.080]   Well, Merry Christmas.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.080]   I know it's not Christmas.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.080]   I know it's Thanksgiving, right?
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.080]   I mentioned this maybe about as early as I can remember,
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.080]   maybe like 10 to 12 years ago,
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.080]   I've noticed that Thanksgiving is slowly disappearing.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.080]   And outside of the church, I'm not hearing this,
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.080]   you know, in the media or social media.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.080]   There's already advertisements going out about Black Friday,
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.080]   and I see Christmas decorations going up early and earlier.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:15.080]   But if there's one holiday that, as Christians,
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.080]   that we really need to be intentional about
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.080]   is this particular holiday, you know?
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.080]   And so I was kind of wrestling through the years,
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.080]   and especially this year, why is Thanksgiving disappearing?
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   Even though it's a major holiday.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.080]   This is not just--it's not like Columbus Day,
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.080]   we have one day and then people forget about it.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.080]   I mean, schools are off.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.080]   Some of the schools are off for the whole week.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.080]   You know, I don't know anybody who's working on Thanksgiving,
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.080]   other than, you know, some of you guys who are, you know.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.080]   But why is this--why is Thanksgiving disappearing?
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.080]   And so I've actually asked some friends,
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.080]   like, what your thoughts are,
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.080]   and why do you think Thanksgiving is disappearing?
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.080]   And so I've heard various things,
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.080]   and, you know, one of the theories that came up
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   is that maybe because of this new woke movement
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.080]   and maybe the pilgrims, you know,
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.080]   didn't treat the initial Native Americans right,
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   and maybe that's the reason.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.080]   And it could be, you know.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.080]   But if it is, there's no intentionality.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.080]   I haven't heard much about it.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.080]   But the more I contemplate, I think part of the reason
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.080]   why this day seems less and less significant,
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.080]   other than the fact that this is a day
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.080]   where there's all kinds of shopping going on,
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.080]   is that we're distracted.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.080]   You know, we're distracted.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.080]   If there's any one particular season of the year
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.080]   where we can be, you know, we can focus our attentions,
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.080]   like everything that I've wanted,
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.080]   everything that I've wanted to buy,
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   Black Friday is coming up, you know,
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   Cyber Monday is coming up,
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.080]   and then we're already thinking about Christmas,
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.080]   thinking about what am I going to get,
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.080]   or what am I going to buy people?
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.080]   And so I think that desire to get Christmas coming
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   is coming earlier and earlier and earlier,
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.080]   and Thanksgiving is just an excuse to do that.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.080]   The reason why, as Christians,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   why this day needs to be taken intentionally
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.080]   is because the Bible says in 2 Timothy 3,
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   in the last days, and I'm not going to read the thing
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.080]   for you for the sake of time,
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.080]   he says there's specific qualities
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.080]   are going to be heightened in the last days
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.080]   before Jesus comes.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.080]   And I want to highlight those three things.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.080]   Those three things he says, the lover of self.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.080]   In other words, people are going to become
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.080]   more and more self-centered, right?
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.080]   The Instagram culture, where we're kind of like
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.080]   promoting ourselves constantly.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.080]   And again, there's nothing wrong with Instagram
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.080]   in and of itself, but we live in a culture
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.080]   where self-promotion is heightened
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.080]   more than any time that I can remember in my life.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.080]   And it tells us that at the end times,
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.080]   we're going to be lovers of self.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.080]   And the second thing it says is ungrateful,
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.080]   that Thanksgiving is basically going to be weeded out.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.080]   In other words, part of the reason why Thanksgiving
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.080]   is being weeded out is because there's constantly
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.080]   things that we covet.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.080]   Whether it's physical things, relationships,
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.080]   or some goals, or job, or whatever it is,
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.080]   this bucket list that we created for ourselves,
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.080]   and we're constantly living and expecting,
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.080]   I want this, I want that, and I want that.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.080]   And it kind of weeds out.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.080]   The more you fill your head with things
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.080]   that you do not have, that you desire,
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.080]   you're naturally not thankful because you don't have it.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.080]   And so we live in a culture where we are bombarded,
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   whether it's things, whether it's experience,
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.080]   whether it's comparing, and so it naturally
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.080]   weeds out thankfulness.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   And as a result of that, it says that there's going
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.080]   to hold onto a form of godliness while denying its power.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.080]   If our hearts are filled with self-centeredness,
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.080]   with ungratefulness, naturally the end result
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   is going to be we're going to pretend,
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   we're going to go through the motions,
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.080]   we're going to sing the songs, we're going to gather together,
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.080]   and we might sit around tables and try to think about
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.080]   what are we thankful for, but it's not an overflowing
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.080]   of what is actually happening in our hearts.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.080]   And Pastor Peter mentioned this morning in Romans 121,
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   that although they knew God, they did not honor him as God
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.080]   or give thanks to him, but they became futile
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.080]   in their thinking, corrupt in their thinking,
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.080]   and their hearts became hardened.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:17.080]   If I was to ask you, what are you thankful for,
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.080]   which is probably what we're going to be doing
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.080]   during Thanksgiving, what are you thankful for?
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.080]   And you'll probably sit and contemplate and say,
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.080]   I'm thankful for my parents, I'm thankful for my husband,
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.080]   my wife, my children, and we go through this list,
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.080]   but we have to really sit down and think,
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.080]   are you actually really thankful for that?
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   But if I was to ask you, what's bothering you?
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.080]   What's bothering you?
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.080]   Most people doesn't need much prodding.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.080]   In fact, if we sit and have a conversation,
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.080]   give it five minutes, right?
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.080]   You don't have to ask, what's bothering you?
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.080]   If you're really open, right, most people,
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.080]   it's just a matter of time.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.080]   They feel comfortable with you enough to be able
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.080]   to open up themselves, and we don't have a problem
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.080]   because we already have a list that we're bothered by.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.080]   That's our natural condition.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.080]   Our natural conditioned heart is to focus on the things
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.080]   that we are not happy about, focus on the things
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   that we do not have.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.080]   And so if we're not intentional about being grateful,
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.080]   our natural inclination is to focus on the things
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.080]   that we're not happy about.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.080]   And so that's why this is so important,
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.080]   that as Christians we gather together and be intentional.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.080]   So the opposite of thankfulness is ungratefulness
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.080]   or bitterness or grumbling.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.080]   And the Bible is filled with warning about grumbling.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.080]   In Hebrews 12:15, he says, "See to it that no one fails
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.080]   to obtain the grace of God, that no root of bitterness
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.080]   springs up and causes trouble, and by it,
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   many become defiled."
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.080]   Do you notice here how he says the root of bitterness?
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.080]   He doesn't just say the fruit of bitterness,
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:01.080]   but the root of bitterness, meaning bitterness is the root
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.080]   of what causes you to be defiled.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.080]   So bitterness and grumbling in heart is the beginning
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.080]   of whatever path that you are going down.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:16.080]   And so there's a warning in Hebrews 12, 15 to watch out
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.080]   for the root of bitterness and grumbling.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:23.080]   1 Corinthians 10, 9-10, it warns us about the nation of Israel
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.080]   and their history.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.080]   We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did,
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.080]   talking about Israelites during the 40 years of wandering,
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.080]   and were destroyed by serpents, nor grumble, as some of them did,
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.080]   and were destroyed by the destroyer.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.080]   What was the cause of their destruction?
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.080]   Why was judgment upon the nation of Israel?
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.080]   There's two things that he says.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.080]   One, they tested God, right?
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.080]   They're constantly asking God to prove himself.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   If you're really God and you really care about us,
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.080]   you should be doing this, this, and this, and this.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.080]   So first thing that they were doing is they were constantly
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.080]   testing God.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   Do you really care?
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.080]   Are you really going to deliver us?
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.080]   Are you really going to care for us?
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.080]   So he said, one, they were testing God.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.080]   And second, the testing led to grumbling.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.080]   When God didn't act the way that they wanted God to act,
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.080]   they started to grumble.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:20.080]   And so the history of Israel during the desert is testing God,
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.080]   and when God didn't pass the test, they would grumble.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.080]   And as a result of their grumbling, it's as some of them did
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.080]   and were destroyed by the destroyer.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.080]   So the root of bitterness comes from testing God.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.080]   Not trusting God, but testing God.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.080]   Are you going to give me what I want?
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.080]   Are you going to answer my prayer?
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.080]   Are you going to make this situation better?
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.080]   And then obviously when things don't work out,
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:50.080]   we tend to grumble, and grumbling is what leads to destruction.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.080]   The Israelites, I think, there's many things that we can say about the Israelites,
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:00.080]   but the period of Israel in the desert, you can say it was a period of grumbling.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.080]   In Exodus 14, 11-12, as soon as God delivered,
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:10.080]   they saw God's power delivered them from the Pharaoh.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.080]   The Pharaoh is the superpower of that time,
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.080]   and this bunch of people who were just slaves,
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.080]   God shows up, performs ten miracles,
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.080]   and you would think that they would just be awed,
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.080]   like, "God delivered us from Pharaoh."
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.080]   But as soon as they get into trouble, they hit the river,
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.080]   and they see Pharaoh coming, and they get scared.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.080]   This is what they say.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.080]   They said to Moses, "Is it because there are no graves in Egypt
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.080]   that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness?"
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.080]   They already forgot about what God has done.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.080]   "What have you done to us in bringing us out of Egypt?
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.080]   Is not this what we said to you in Egypt?
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians."
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.080]   Let me stop right there.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.080]   That's a bold-faced lie, right?
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.080]   But as soon as they ran into the wall, and they got scared,
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.080]   and they tested God, and God--
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   Is he actually going to show up? Pharaoh's actually coming.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.080]   After all of that, he says, "Oh, I never wanted to come out."
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.080]   "I never asked you to deliver us," even though the Bible is very clear.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.080]   The only reason why God answered them is because they were crying out to God,
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.080]   and God had mercy on them.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.080]   But here it says, "Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians,
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.080]   for it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.080]   than to die in the wilderness."
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:30.080]   That was the beginning, beginning of God's deliverance.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.080]   They grumbled about the lack of water.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.080]   They grumbled about the lack of food.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   They grumbled about the type of food.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.080]   When they got the food, they got tired of the food and said,
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.080]   "Is this all we're going to eat?"
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.080]   They grumbled about the inhabitants of the promised land.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.080]   "You brought us out here to fight with these people?"
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.080]   Then eventually the grumbling led to the leaders.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.080]   "You led us out here?"
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.080]   Ultimately, in Exodus 16:8, Moses says,
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.080]   "All of your grumbling is not a grumbling to me or to people."
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.080]   He says, "Ultimately, it's a grumbling to God."
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.080]   In Exodus 16:8, Moses says,
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.080]   "Your grumblings are not against us, but against the Lord."
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.080]   They were known to be grumblers, constantly complaining,
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.080]   constantly testing God.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:20.080]   Again, our natural tendency is when we are not intentional.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.080]   If you're not fighting against your flesh,
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.080]   our natural intention, our natural inclination is
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.080]   we look at things and we covet.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.080]   "Oh, he has that car. How come I don't have it?"
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.080]   "Oh, their family is like this, but how come we don't have it?"
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.080]   "Oh, they're able to experience that, but how come I don't have it?"
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.080]   Then we fill ourselves with discontent,
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.080]   and this discontent leads to grumbling.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:48.080]   Then eventually, the root of bitterness of grumbling leads to destruction.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:54.080]   You guys have known or heard that somebody in California won $2 billion.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:58.080]   I'm sure all of you have fantasized that maybe I should have bought that ticket.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.080]   I fantasized.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   If I bought that ticket, I said, "Okay, basketball court's going up.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.080]   We're going to buy that building and the building next to it
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.080]   and the one after that."
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.080]   I fantasized.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:15.080]   Every time I go to India, I'm going to go first class.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.080]   Somebody in California won $2 billion,
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.080]   and as soon as they won $2 billion, you see articles coming up saying,
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.080]   "$2 billion isn't really $2 billion.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.080]   If he takes the lump sum, he's actually--
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.080]   if you calculate the taxes and if you calculate all the fees
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.080]   that they have to pay, he actually only gets--
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.080]   this is the actual number that they came up with--
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:42.080]   he only gets $300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   It's not actually $2 billion that he's going to get.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   He's only going to get $634,000,000,000.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.080]   Don't be so excited that he got $2 billion.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.080]   It's only $634,000,000,000.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:01.080]   If the tone of the article is, "They're going to take away all of that
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.080]   after taxes and after all the fees are paid,"
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.080]   can you believe that?
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.080]   It's not $2 billion. It's only $634,000,000,000.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.080]   As ridiculous as that sounds,
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:18.080]   every Christian who lives every single day grumbling and complaining
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.080]   is actually much worse than that
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.080]   because that $2 billion is temporary.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:29.080]   That $2 billion, we can live out our fantasy for a short period of time,
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   but every child of God has the Holy Spirit
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.080]   deposited in us where we are able to call
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.080]   the creator of the universe who $2 billion is chump change to him.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:46.080]   He can literally get gold coins out of the mouth of the fish,
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.080]   has become our Abba Father.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.080]   And that Abba Father says, "Call me your father."
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:56.080]   "If my words are provided to you, ask whatever you wish."
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.080]   "Ask whatever you wish," he said, "it shall be done for you."
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.080]   And that was given to us freely by the blood of Christ.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.080]   And yet we have a tendency to forget about that.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.080]   "Only $634,000,000?
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:19.080]   You mean I have to love them? I got to do this? I don't have that?"
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:24.080]   As silly as that sounds, that's exactly what it must sound like to God.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.080]   For the Israelites to be grumbling they don't have water,
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:32.080]   they don't have food, or they don't have variety of food.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.080]   See, Philippians 2, 14-16 says,
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.080]   "Do all things without grumbling or questioning."
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.080]   Do all things without grumbling or questioning.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.080]   "That you may be blameless and innocent,
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.080]   children of God, without blemish, in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation."
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.080]   You notice here the crooked and twisted generation,
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.080]   the quality that he describes is a generation that is grumbling and complaining.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.080]   He says, "You be different, be blameless and innocent,
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.080]   among whom you shine as light in the world."
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.080]   So what does shining look like?
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   Unlike the rest of the world who's constantly living their lives
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.080]   comparing and discontent and grumbling and bitter,
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   that we live as people who have been delivered
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   and won the greatest lottery.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.080]   He says, "Holding fast the word of life,
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.080]   so that in the day of Christ I may be proud
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   that I did not run in vain or labor in vain."
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:31.080]   Life has a way of sucking joy out of us.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.080]   That's why whenever you see a church filled with young people,
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.080]   there tends to be life.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.080]   At least it's perceived to be life.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.080]   You have a church filled with old people,
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.080]   there tends to be a little bit lesser life or joy.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.080]   I mean, that's the truth.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.080]   But part of the reason why that happens is because as you live,
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.080]   life has a tendency to suck the joy out of you.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.080]   You go to work, you've got a bad boss,
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:03.080]   the honeymoon period of your marriage is behind you.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.080]   And then you have kids and that initial excitement of having kids
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.080]   and now you're raising them, waking up and they're sick and they're tired
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.080]   and they're selfish and they say hurtful things.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.080]   They have a tendency to suck it out of you.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.080]   Then life eventually doesn't turn out the way you thought.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.080]   By the time you were 30, you thought you were going to be a millionaire.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.080]   By the time you were 40, you thought you were going to have kids.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.080]   By the time you're 50, you're going to have this.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.080]   That's why people go through a midlife crisis
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.080]   because life doesn't turn out the way that they were hoping,
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.080]   which is not just two or three people.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.080]   We're talking about the whole world experiences this.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.080]   So the older we get, the more discontent we get,
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.080]   the more bitter we get, the more grumbling.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.080]   So it's very difficult to get old people excited
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.080]   because we've been disappointed over and over and over again.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:58.080]   If we're not careful, that is the path that we're all on.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.080]   That is the path that we're all on.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.080]   What you see in the older generation that said,
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   "I'm not going to be like that when I get older."
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:11.080]   I guarantee you 100% that's exactly where you're headed.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:17.080]   They said the same thing when they were your age.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.080]   And the generation before that said the same thing when they were younger.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.080]   But life has a tendency to suck you in to the same path.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.080]   Everything that you've seen gone before us
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.080]   is a path that everybody else is going in.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   But the difference for Christians is that we are to go against the tide.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.080]   We are to be intentional with our life.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.080]   That's why it says, "Rejoice always. Pray without ceasing.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:41.080]   Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you."
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.080]   In Genesis 50:20, even in the most dire situation,
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.080]   Joseph says, "What you meant for evil, God meant for good."
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.080]   So the source of our joy and happiness and thanksgiving
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   is not that we have what the world has.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.080]   That through Jesus, that what they can't get by themselves,
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.080]   we can get through prayer and if we're good to God.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.080]   And He'll give us a good family.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.080]   He said, "No, that's not Christian joy."
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.080]   Christian joy is not based upon what they can have.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.080]   It's completely otherworldly.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.080]   The things that the world complains about, we rejoice over.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.080]   Things that people grumble about in the world, we rejoice over.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:28.080]   And the reason why we rejoice over it is what seems to be evil, God means for good.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.080]   What seems to be evil on the surface, God meant it for good
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.080]   because we believe in a sovereign God.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.080]   Let me wrap it up in this.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:44.080]   As we are going to break up and take some time to have discussion with our groups,
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:50.080]   what causes the greatest joy, gratitude, and worship in your life?
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.080]   I think the answer is pretty simple.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:58.080]   When we are given something tremendous that you didn't deserve,
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.080]   that's what causes gratitude.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:09.080]   And there's a reason why the Bible says that He's given to us salvation by grace.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.080]   He says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith that is not of yourself,
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   it is a gift of God."
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.080]   For what reason?
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.080]   So that no one may boast.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.080]   Because boasting kills gratitude.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.080]   Gratitude means you did it.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.080]   You deserved it.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.080]   You worked harder.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   You were more disciplined.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.080]   You were more moral.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.080]   You were more committed.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.080]   You were more sacrificial.
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.080]   And that's why you have what you have.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.080]   He says, "No."
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.080]   He said salvation was given to you by the grace of God
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.080]   specifically so that you could not boast.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.080]   So that you would recognize the tremendous gift that God has given you
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.080]   was a free gift given to you.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:56.080]   2 Corinthians 4:15, "For it is all for your sake so that as grace extends to more and more people,
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   it may increase thanksgiving to the glory of God."
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:06.080]   As grace increases, as our appreciation and love for what Christ has done for us increases,
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.080]   what does it say?
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.080]   It increases in gratitude.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.080]   So when you see somebody who is always thankful as a Christian,
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.080]   it's because they understand grace more than you.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.080]   They appreciate grace more than you.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   They recognize what they have in Christ more than you.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:30.080]   And so part of what it means to grow spiritually is to become more like that, right?
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   Recognizing that you and I have won the biggest lottery spiritually.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.080]   And for the rest of our lives that we celebrate this lottery that he's given us,
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:45.080]   that no matter what happens in this life, that we have a mansion waiting for us.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   We have an eternal home waiting for us.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.080]   No matter what happens, no matter what you're going through,
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:54.080]   what the world meant for evil, God meant for good.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:59.080]   I'm going to give you some practical things to think about.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:05.080]   You know, years ago, the first time I went to Together for the Gospel,
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.080]   some of you guys know that ministry.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.080]   They actually ended it.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.080]   They don't have that anymore.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.080]   But I remember going to that Together for the Gospel,
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   and I was really excited because it was people from all different backgrounds.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.080]   You know, all different.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   There's some Charismatics there.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   There's Baptists.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.080]   There's the Presbyterians.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:27.080]   And everybody, like we agreed on the same doctrines, core doctrines,
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.080]   but we are all from different denominations.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:36.080]   And I was so encouraged to be a part of that group because I felt like, you know,
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.080]   this is like the universal church coming together to praise God.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:45.080]   But I remember my experience very clearly because there's some guys that I would meet,
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:49.080]   and the first question that they would ask me after they would ask me, "What's your name?"
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.080]   is, "What do you think about this doctrine?
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.080]   What do you think about the doctrine of grace?
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.080]   What is your position on this, and what is your position on that?"
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:01.080]   So it's almost kind of like they're jockeying to say, "Can I fellowship with you?"
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.080]   Right?
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   "Are you with me?
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   Are you, you know?"
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:09.080]   And so everything became kind of like, "Okay, I've got to prove myself to this group.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.080]   I've got to say the right things to this group."
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.080]   But there was a group of people that I met that was there praising God, and they said,
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.080]   "Oh, Peter, you're a Christian?
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.080]   That's awesome.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.080]   Isn't this awesome?
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.080]   Isn't this great?"
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.080]   And we would sing praises.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.080]   They're the ones singing the loudest.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.080]   They're just happy to be there, and they say, "Hey, you going out to eat with anybody?
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.080]   Let's go."
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.080]   They would invite me, and they'd say, "Where do you live?"
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.080]   And I'd say, "I live in Irvine."
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.080]   And they'd say, "Oh, that's great.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   I'm going to be in Irvine next year.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.080]   I'll call you up."
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.080]   It's like, "I just met this guy."
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.080]   But they were just so excited to meet me, and they said, "Hey, if you're ever in Tennessee,
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.080]   let me know."
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.080]   And he would give me his number.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   "I just met you."
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.080]   You don't know what my doctrines are.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   You don't know what my position is.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:54.080]   But just the fact that he met another Christian, he was just excited, and I started meeting
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.080]   these guys from that same church.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.080]   And they were all like that.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:02.080]   So my first inclination is, "What's wrong with these people?"
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.080]   That was my first inclination.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.080]   Like, "Whoa, what?
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.080]   Do they not know that we may not have the same doctrines?
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.080]   Do they not know that we come from different backgrounds?
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.080]   Why are they just so excited?"
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:17.080]   Just because I'm a Christian.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:22.080]   The reason why that stood out to me is because I was not like that.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.080]   I was just like the other guys.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.080]   I was cautious.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   Can I trust these people?
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   Are we on the same page?
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:35.080]   But when I saw the joy that they had, I remember what it was like to be like that.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.080]   Just being happy to be a Christian.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.080]   And fellowship that happened because they met another Christian.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.080]   And they're just excited and generous.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:49.080]   It was as if they won the lottery.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.080]   That's how they were acting.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:56.080]   They were acting like they got something for free, and they're just eager to share it with
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.080]   everybody.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:05.080]   But as time goes by, you experience hardship and pain.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.080]   We become kind of more recluse.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:14.080]   I know now, after so many years of being a Christian, I can tell a troublemaker coming
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.080]   before they come.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.080]   Because I've had so many experiences.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.080]   The way they talk, the way they act, it's like, "Oh, that guy's going to be trouble."
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:28.080]   Then immediately my inclination is to guard my heart, stiff-arm them, just be cordial.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:32.080]   Because I can recognize them much earlier than before.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.080]   So I don't want to be caught off guard like before.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:40.080]   I tend to rejoice over what's happening at our church.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.080]   When I see fruits at our church, when our church is growing.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.080]   But when I see what's happening down there, I'm skeptical.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.080]   What's going on over there?
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.080]   Maybe they're compromising.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.080]   Maybe then the Bible's not being taught.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:56.080]   Maybe the people who are going over there are not as serious as people coming over here.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.080]   So I have a tendency to be excited about what's happening over here, but not about the
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   universal church.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:08.080]   I tend to rejoice over things that directly affect me.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.080]   But what's happening around the world, what's happening, what God is doing with other
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   Christians, other missionaries, other churches, it doesn't affect me as much.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:21.080]   So what causes me to be thankful usually is self-centered.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:26.080]   My thoughts naturally gravitate toward things that are bothering me.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.080]   I have to work.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:35.080]   Like today, I'm going to have to work to tell you this is what I'm grateful for.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.080]   Because it doesn't come out naturally.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:43.080]   But if you spend enough time with me, it will start to leak out what bothers me.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:47.080]   What kind of hardship there is in the church.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.080]   Like who's causing me trouble.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.080]   And I have to fight to hold my tongue.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.080]   I literally have to fight to hold my tongue.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:00.080]   But I have to work toward praising God.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.080]   I don't want to be that person.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.080]   And this is why Thanksgiving is so important.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:13.080]   Because if we're not intentional, that's where we naturally drift toward.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:20.080]   And when we're not praising God in our hearts, we hold on to a form of godliness.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:24.080]   We sing the songs, but it's not worship.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.080]   We share the gospel, but we're just sharing information.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.080]   But we're not sharing the life of Christ.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:38.080]   So what I want to encourage us this evening as we get into our small groups is Philippians 4, 8 through 9.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.080]   That as a church, that we fight.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.080]   We fight to worship.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.080]   We fight and be intentional about being thankful.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:51.080]   That we are deliberate about being joyful.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.080]   Philippians 4, 8 through 9.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:58.080]   Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.080]   Whatever is lovely, whatever is good repute.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:07.080]   If there's any excellence and if there's anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:13.080]   So we want to take some time to dwell on these things in our groups, home groups, in our small groups.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.080]   And there's four questions that was emailed out to you.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.080]   And so let me just review it.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.080]   And I'm going to pray or I'm going to ask the praise team to come back up.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   And they're going to sing and then we're going to end and let you go back to your groups.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.080]   What is it about your salvation that you are the most thankful for?
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:37.080]   Specifically, not just I got saved, you know, but what is it about specifically about your salvation are you the most thankful for?
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:45.080]   Number two, would people who are the closest to you describe you as a bitter or discontent person or a joyful person?
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.080]   And I'm not talking superficially.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.080]   You can always put up a good front.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.080]   But I'm talking about the people who know you behind the scene.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:42:02.080]   When you don't have your guards up, do they know you as a joyful, thankful, worshipful person or discontent, bitter and grumbling?
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:07.080]   Three, how does an unthankful spirit affect your daily life?
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:11.080]   How does it affect the quality of your worship and obedience to God?
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:16.080]   Four, how can we restore an attitude of gratitude on a daily basis?
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:22.080]   Specifically, how can we be intentional so that we can worship God in spirit and in truth?
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.080]   Let me pray for us and let me ask the praise team to come back up.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:30.080]   Then after the praise is finished, we'll release you to your groups.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:35.080]   OK, let me pray for us as our worship team comes up.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:45.080]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the time that you've given us to be intentional about Thanksgiving.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:54.080]   Lord, if our hearts have drifted and that we are externally working so hard to be righteous,
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:43:02.080]   but yet the heart of true worship has drifted from us for a long time.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:11.080]   Help us, Lord God, to be intentional, to be deliberate, to fight, Lord God, toward our thoughts, our hearts, what we feel.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:21.080]   Restore in us a joy of our salvation, that we may be people who worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.080]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:38.080]   [music]
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:52.080]   Should nothing of our efforts stand, no legacy survive.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:44:06.080]   Unless the Lord does raise the house in vain, His builders strive.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:20.080]   To you who boast tomorrow's gain, tell me what is your life?
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:34.080]   Amidst the vanishes at dawn, all glory be to Christ.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:49.080]   All glory be to Christ our King, all glory be to Christ.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:45:07.080]   His ruling will ever sing, all glory be to Christ.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:21.080]   His will be done, His kingdom come on earth as is above.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:36.080]   Who wins Himself our daily bread, praise Him, the Lord of love.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:50.080]   Let living water satisfy the thirsty without price.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:46:04.080]   We'll take a cup of kindness yet, all glory be to Christ.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:18.080]   All glory be to Christ our King, all glory be to Christ.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:36.080]   His ruling reign will ever sing, all glory be to Christ.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:50.080]   When on the day of great I Am, the faithful and the true,
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:47:05.080]   the Lamb who was for sinners slain is making all things new.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:19.080]   Behold, our God shall live with us and be our steadfast light.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:33.080]   And we shall there His people be, all glory be to Christ.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:47.080]   All glory be to Christ our King, all glory be to Christ.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:48:02.080]   His ruling reign will ever sing, all glory be to Christ.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:16.080]   All glory be to Christ our King, all glory be to Christ.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:32.080]   His ruling reign will ever sing, all glory be to Christ.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:42.080]   Alright, for those discussion questions that Pastor Peter Kim mentioned,
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:51.080]   they've been emailed out to every host of each group, but also they're posted on our generic Facebook group on the Berean Community Church Facebook group.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:55.080]   Alright, so at this time, please go ahead and go into your groups to discuss.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:58.080]   Have a great night of fellowship and discussion, everyone. Good night.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:06.080]   [no dialogue]
