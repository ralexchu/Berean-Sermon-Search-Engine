[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   All right, so if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 16, verse 25 through
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.760]   27.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.120]   I'm going to read it again just as a reminder.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.800]   Now to him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.880]   according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past,
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.440]   but now is manifested and by scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.240]   of the eternal God has been made known to all the nations leading to the obedience of
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.240]   faith.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.640]   To the only wise God through Jesus Christ be the glory forever.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.040]   Amen.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.560]   Let's pray.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.040]   Heavenly Father, we've gathered here together this morning because we want to hear from
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.220]   you.
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.940]   Not to simply study this text, not to simply meet our friends.
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.600]   We desire Father God to hear from you, to meet you, to drink of the living water, to
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.600]   eat the bread, Lord God, which is Christ.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.100]   I pray your word will be open to us.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.320]   Help us to see your spirit, your very breath.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.600]   May our hearts, Lord God, be filled with you and reminders, Lord, of the reality of the
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.040]   unseen things, Lord God, that we are hoping for.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.880]   We pray in our busyness, help us never to be distracted and to conform to the pattern
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.880]   of this world.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.200]   But I pray that preaching of your word and listening to your word would renew our minds
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.520]   that we may discern what is good and perfect will of the Lord.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.440]   We entrust this time to you asking for your blessing.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.440]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.440]   Amen.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.520]   All right.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.040]   We are finally at the last sermon of the Book of Romans.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.840]   I do not have any more after this unless I choose to do an overview survey for the next
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.840]   few months.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.880]   But, no, it is the final message.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.440]   I am kind of reluctant to get out of it because, again, Romans is, you know, I have shared
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.200]   with you many times Romans is probably the book that if I had one book that I wanted
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.000]   to put to memory and really have it regurgitating in my soul, it would be the Book of Romans
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.720]   because it is so rich in content.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.340]   Every aspect of the gospel that we hear of all our lives, whether you have been a Christian
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.320]   for a year or you have been a Christian for 30, 40 years, basically what we are doing
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.680]   every single week is reexamining, deepening on our understanding of what Paul is saying
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.280]   in the Book of Romans in different aspects.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.320]   Paul is going to conclude this letter in the same way that he started the Book of Romans.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.280]   So again, assuming that none of you remember what we talked about in Romans chapter 1,
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.360]   but I gave a brief overview last week.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.440]   So basically the content of what he says here is repeated exactly the same thing that he
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.560]   says when he opens up the letter in Romans chapter 1, 1 through 17.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.600]   It talks about God's power, the purpose of the gospel.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.820]   It talks about mystery that is to be revealed.
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.200]   It talks about sanctification.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.040]   So everything that we are talking about, he says it.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.140]   So he is kind of wrapping it up with these two book ends of this is the gospel.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.960]   And that is basically what he has been expositing the last 16 chapters.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.200]   The two things that we looked at last week was the gospel is a demonstration of God's
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   power.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.680]   So the power of God that people are constantly looking to connect with God with his power.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.920]   We want to see him doing miraculous things and if he heals or if he does something beyond
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.720]   human ability, we say that is God's power and that would help me to see and believe
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.720]   in God.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.560]   But the scripture says it is the gospel, the gospel, his death and resurrection.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.160]   That is the demonstration of God's power.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.320]   And then the second part that we talked about how Jesus is the gospel.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.960]   That the preaching of the gospel is the preaching of Jesus Christ.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.280]   That Jesus says that he is I am.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.400]   So the point of all that we have learned about the gospel is to bring us ultimately to him.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.160]   Not just through him, but to him.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.960]   You can come to church all your life and never have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.560]   Somebody can blaspheme his name and you get very offended when you say your mama is and
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.560]   then you get nervous.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.800]   But if you say God is, nothing.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.280]   Because there is no personal affection for him.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.960]   You hear people blaspheming his name and it doesn't offend you because there is no personal
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.560]   connection with this Lord.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.120]   So if we are not careful, we can be an expert of the gospel, expert of what the word of
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.640]   God says, but be completely emotionally in every practical aspect completely disconnected
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.360]   with this God.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.560]   So the second part was Jesus is the gospel.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.720]   The third, fourth and fifth, the third is the main part and the fourth and fourth and
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.160]   fifth is going to be kind of tagging along with that.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.040]   So I'm going to be spending most of my time on the third point where the gospel is the
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.680]   mystery revealed.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.000]   Gospel is the mystery revealed.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.360]   We have to be careful when we study the Bible that we don't project onto it what we think
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.360]   it means.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.480]   So this was written obviously in 2000 years ago, the vocabulary that they used at that
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.480]   time.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.440]   So in interpreting the Bible, okay, this is a pop quiz and I know you college students
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.400]   are in the middle of your finals, okay, but this is a pop quiz, all right?
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.040]   In interpreting the Bible, what is the most important part of understanding what that
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:31.520]   text means?
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.360]   I feel it, but I don't hear it.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.720]   What is the most important part of Bible interpretation to get the right meaning?
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.120]   And this isn't just the Bible, this is just common sense in anything that you read.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.760]   Context.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.000]   Yes, my son.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.800]   Context, right?
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.560]   Some of you guys don't know what I'm talking about.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.920]   He's actually my son.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.120]   Context, right?
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.360]   You have to understand what is being said in context, in context of the letter, in context
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.280]   of the culture, in context of how the person is using the word, right?
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.560]   It has to be understood in context.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.000]   The problem, the danger of interpreting the scripture where you take a passage out and
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.240]   then you say, "Well, that's what I heard," right?
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.480]   That's no different than jumping into the middle of a conversation and somebody says
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.960]   something and said, "But you said this, but you didn't hear the whole conversation.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.520]   He was just quoting somebody."
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.080]   You can take it completely out of context and it has nothing to do with what he says
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.680]   if you don't understand the context.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.200]   Well, this word here, mystery, is a contextual word.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.760]   In fact, it's a very important word.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.200]   The New Testament uses it in relation to the gospel over 26 separate times.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.720]   Jesus uses it repeatedly in the way he teaches the parables about the kingdom of God.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.120]   He says it repeatedly about the mystery of the kingdom, the mystery of the kingdom.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.640]   Paul uses it probably predominantly more than anybody else.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.920]   It's repeated again all the way through the book of Revelation that the gospel is the
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:18.080]   mystery of God, which was at one point hidden and it is now revealed.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.360]   The first thing that we need to understand before we begin to project onto it what we
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.880]   normally mean by mystery.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.480]   When we think of mystery, you're probably thinking of the genre of mystery, that you
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.480]   have a bunch of things happening and you can't quite understand.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.600]   Or you would say something or someone is mysterious.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.640]   There's something about it that you can't quite put together, that it's hard to understand.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.120]   That is not how the Bible uses the term mystery.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.240]   I think the best way for us to understand the term mystery is something that was hidden,
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.660]   but it is revealed to specific people, that it is meant for people to know, but the way
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:03.720]   that he revealed it is through progressive revelation.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:10.480]   Now since we're all movie buffs, or at least many of you, let me ask you.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.720]   I'm not talking about a singular movie.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.100]   I'm talking about series of movies that they've created throughout maybe 10 years or 20 years
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:27.720]   What do you think is the best series of movies in the last 50 years?
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.720]   What do you think?
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.280]   It has to be more than two, three.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.560]   It has to be more than one.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.200]   That's what series means in English.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   What is it?
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:44.760]   It has to be more than one.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.760]   Lord of the Rings, okay.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.760]   All right.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.760]   That's a good one.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.320]   I wasn't thinking about that one.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.320]   Something else.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.760]   That's probably on the top of the list.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   Star Wars.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.760]   The end.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.760]   All right.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.600]   That's what I was looking for.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:08.440]   So Star Wars obviously came out many, many decades ago, and it didn't start at the beginning.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:14.640]   It started, and everybody, like people who are older than me, really got into Star Wars,
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.320]   and then when the prequels began to come out, the story began to make more sense.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.640]   So you can watch it and enjoy it by itself, but when you began to understand the history
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:31.320]   and the story behind it, it really made that much more, it made a lot more sense.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.520]   And then obviously they have other movies that were coming.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.760]   And you can say, "Well, I like this one better than the other ones."
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.800]   But the storyline in and of itself, right, every one of those things fits together and
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.560]   it makes a lot of sense.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.200]   How they came about and where Darth Vader comes from and how he turned into Darth Vader
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:55.680]   and who his son is and all of these things that was left, what, a mystery in the first
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.240]   movie began to get revealed through the prequels.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:07.600]   The best way for us to understand this gospel is that God has implanted into human history,
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.000]   and that's what we've been studying in the book of Revelation.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.920]   He's been planting in the history all these things that in and of itself for the nation
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.600]   of Israel made a lot of sense.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.840]   This is what it meant to be holy, this is what it meant to be atoned for, but the ultimate
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:28.140]   purpose behind it was meant to be revealed in the future in Christ.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.360]   So it wasn't that the gospel was left a mystery and something for us to unravel like Rubik's
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.640]   Cube and if you're really good at it, you can figure this out.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:43.000]   God deliberately left imprints of what he was about to do.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.760]   And so when Christ came, all of a sudden it became a reality.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.980]   In fact, Jesus himself in Matthew 13, 10 through 11, before his death and resurrection was
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.840]   teaching about the kingdom through parables and the disciples asked him, "Why do you
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.640]   teach them in parables?"
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.640]   This is what Jesus said.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.920]   The disciples came to him and said to him, in Matthew 13, 10 through 11, "Why do you
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.120]   speak to them in parables?"
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.160]   Jesus answered them, "To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.960]   of heaven, but to them it has not been granted."
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:18.620]   So for those of them who believed, he said the parables actually made more sense.
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:24.960]   Just like we use illustrations today, we would give a teaching to really help us understand.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.240]   Just like what I use Star Wars as an illustration, to help us to understand what does the Bible
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.440]   mean by mystery.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:38.200]   But to those who don't believe, the parables actually make it harder.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.200]   He said he left it like that.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.400]   And he said he spoke in mystery for the purpose of revelation.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:49.360]   Romans 11, 25, "I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery," talking
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.680]   about the gospel, "so that you will not be wise in your own estimation that a partial
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.440]   hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in."
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:05.800]   In other words, because of Israel's sin, this mystery that he gave the nation of Israel
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:13.880]   that began to get revealed to the Gentiles, that the Israelites were experiencing this
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.800]   continued hardening until the fullness of time of the Gentiles, which is the period
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.800]   that we're in.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:25.480]   To clarify even further, 2 Corinthians 3, 14-18.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.560]   Paul says of the nation of Israel, "But their minds were hardened, for until this very day
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.880]   at the reading of the old covenant," which is talking about the Old Testament, "the same
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.720]   veil remains unlifted because it is removed in Christ."
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:43.760]   In other words, the answer was in Christ, but because they refused to receive him to
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.880]   them, the gospel remains a mystery.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.320]   It is veiled.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:58.200]   Verse 15, "But to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:03.880]   But whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away."
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.840]   Now let me stop here for a minute.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:12.680]   So the way that the mystery was revealed wasn't simply through careful study.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.240]   Who reveals this?
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:23.400]   According to what we read, who reveals this mystery and the reality that is found in Christ?
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.400]   God does, right?
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.280]   It wasn't simply, "Oh, they didn't study enough," or "They didn't read enough books."
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:33.080]   He said, "Because they refused Christ, there's a veil that remains even to this day.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.600]   But whenever a person turns to the Lord, veil is taken away.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.480]   Now the Lord is the spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.520]   But we all with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, being transformed
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.920]   into the same image from glory to glory."
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:55.040]   So in other words, when the veil was taken away, and when he began to behold his glory,
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.880]   we began to change by seeing that glory.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.200]   You understand?
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.400]   Right now, he described not only justification, but also sanctification.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.360]   So glorification, justification happens when the veil is torn.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360]   Right?
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.320]   Did you see that?
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.480]   So the mystery that was behind the curtain, all of a sudden, we saw it, and it made sense.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.160]   All of what we've been studying in Leviticus began to make sense that Christ fulfills this,
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.880]   and he tears the curtain, and now we behold the glory.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.080]   And then sanctification is continuing, right?
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.640]   Continuing to see this glory that's been revealed.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:39.960]   So now we are transformed to his glory as we gaze upon his glory.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.160]   Does that make sense?
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.560]   So how does sanctification happen?
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:52.800]   A greater and greater revelation of that glory, of this mystery that God begins to reveal.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.920]   Let me look at another passage.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:00.640]   First Corinthians 2, 6-10.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:06.240]   "Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature, a wisdom, however, not of this age,
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.400]   nor the rulers of this age, who are passing away."
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.880]   Let me stop right here.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:15.120]   He's talking about now not the Jews, but the rest of the world who do not believe.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.520]   And he says this wisdom that he is preaching is not a wisdom of this world, meaning you
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.720]   can't study this.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:28.680]   You can't have the revelation of God simply because you read a lot of books or attended
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.880]   churches, because it's God's doing.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:38.360]   "But we speak," verse 7, "God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.720]   before the ages to our glory, the wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:48.240]   With all the knowledge and education and access they have to information, it's that none of
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.320]   them could figure out, for if they had understood, if they would not have crucified the Lord
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:58.200]   of glory, but just as it is written, 'Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:04.000]   and which have not entered the heart of man,' all that God has prepared for those who love
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   him.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.280]   God revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depth
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.280]   of God."
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.240]   It is not by human wisdom.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.120]   It is not by human effort.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.820]   It is not by us simply trying.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.280]   He says it is by God.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.720]   When we believe and we begin to behold his glory, and that's exactly what the scripture
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.720]   says.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:34.720]   "The God of this age blinded the mind of the unbelievers so they do not see the glory of
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.600]   the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:44.120]   So salvation is the blinders being taken away so that we may begin to gaze upon his glory.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:51.600]   That's why Jonathan Edwards says, "The greatest evidence of the salvation is this renewed
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.660]   affection for God's glory."
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.100]   You can love the church, the people, the mission.
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.220]   You can love the gathering.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:07.800]   You can love whatever it is that the church is involved with and yet have no affection
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.060]   for the glory of God.
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.120]   There is no beholding his glory.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.580]   That's what Jonathan Edwards means.
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:25.420]   But the greatest evidence of your justification is your renewed affection for Jesus Christ.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:33.620]   See, in the earthly kingdom, they only believe what they can see.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.360]   If I don't see it, I don't believe it.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.120]   But in God's kingdom, we can only see what we believe.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.260]   Let me say that again.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.760]   In the earthly kingdom, they only believe what they can see.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.460]   But in God's kingdom, we can only see what we believe.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.300]   Let me give you an example.
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.940]   You listen to that and say, "Well, that sounds like a cop-out.
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.220]   That sounds like something you say to somebody when you don't have an answer."
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.220]   Right?
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.220]   Maybe.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.460]   But let me give you an example.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:08.180]   Have you ever had a funny moment with maybe a close friend of yours?
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:13.540]   Maybe you went to missions and you came back and said, "Oh my gosh, it was so hilarious.
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.540]   It was so funny.
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.660]   We cracked up for 10, 15 minutes and people were telling us to be quiet because we just
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.300]   couldn't contain ourselves."
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.460]   And then they asked you, "What happened?"
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:29.900]   And then the moment you begin to share the story, there's a confusion that comes because
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.220]   it's not funny at all.
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.620]   And even as you're telling it, you can tell that this is not funny.
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.740]   I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.640]   And the only explanation you can give is, "You had to have been there."
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.260]   So it wasn't simply the story.
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.400]   It was the expression.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.460]   It was the context.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.340]   It was things that led up to that.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:55.860]   And all of that contributed to why probably at that moment it must have been funny.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:00.780]   But when you try to recreate that by telling somebody, you just can't recreate it.
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.140]   That's something that happened at that moment.
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.860]   And all that led up to that and all that was around that.
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.740]   And the connection maybe between that person.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:16.460]   In the same way, when we try to reveal the gospel, the Bible says it is veiled.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.780]   And it is open to those that God chooses to have it open.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:29.900]   And so once God opens our eyes, all of a sudden it makes sense.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:37.100]   You know that missionary who went out to India and found out that, I think, Jonathan Chow,
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.300]   there's been a lot of stories and there's been a lot of confusion as to what to make
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.700]   of it.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.780]   And the sad thing is even some of the Christians were looking at that and saying, "Oh, what
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.620]   was that guy doing going to India?"
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.020]   You know, that's how we got the gospel.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:55.620]   Some crazy person or people decided to risk their lives and translate the Bible into English
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.060]   and get the gospel over to us.
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.660]   And that's how we got the gospel.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:06.260]   You know, what he did was very common in the context of the gospel history.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.460]   See, the world doesn't understand it.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.020]   If you're not a Christian, that makes absolutely no sense.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:19.020]   Why would a young man who has a very promising career, educated, intelligent, why would he
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.020]   do such a stupid thing?
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:28.060]   Go to an area of the world to preach this silly message and give his life.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.060]   He must have been crazy.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.300]   There's something about him.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.020]   And so they're trying to figure out what led him to do that.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.860]   Oh, he was so adventurous and he just didn't care about...
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.700]   And they're doing their best to try to understand.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:46.380]   But if you genuinely believe what the gospel message says, and that's the reason why you're
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.020]   here, there is no need for explanation.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.020]   You know why he did it.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:56.340]   In fact, not only is it not confusing, it's challenging that that person was willing to
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:01.140]   give his life to share the gospel to the unreached people.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.460]   No matter how much you try to explain that, that's not something you can explain until
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.900]   they actually see for themselves.
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:07.900]   There's people at our church.
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.820]   I remember early on when we used to go out to China.
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:15.060]   I remember some of the parents, when we used to go out to China, and at that time, China
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.660]   was not as comfortable as it is now.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.220]   It's become very modern.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.900]   And at that time, there's a lot of stories about underground church leaders getting jailed.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.380]   And I remember early on when we were going there to teach English, we would pay a lot
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.100]   of money to go there to teach English, pay a lot of money to run the camps so we could
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.100]   share the gospel.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:36.340]   And I remember some of the parents who weren't Christian at the time saying, "What are you
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.100]   guys doing?
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.740]   If you go to Japan or Korea, you can make a lot of money in the summer.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:47.500]   Why would you pay money to go to a place in the world and work for them for free and come
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.740]   back with nothing?"
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:57.300]   I'm not going to tell you who they are, but eventually, one of the parents became Christians
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.180]   themselves.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.740]   And then they came to us.
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:05.340]   They came with us at one point to China to do missions, to do the same thing.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.020]   Something they could not figure out.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.740]   They couldn't understand.
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:13.140]   Until the veil was torn, they began to see the mystery revealed.
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:17.340]   All of a sudden, not only did it make sense, they participated.
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.820]   They began to support.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:20.820]   That's what he means.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:25.340]   That at one point when it was hidden, now it is open for people to see.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:33.340]   And it was not only was it hidden, he deliberately put it into the Old Testament to cause a stir.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:38.340]   Kind of like the way the movies are made today.
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.300]   Today's theme is movies.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.540]   I guess this is not a movie.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.540]   It's a TV series.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.500]   Remember a while back, there was a TV series called 24.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.860]   You guys remember that?
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.100]   I don't like watching things for a long period of time.
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.300]   If it's like one ends, then I want to be done with it.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.040]   I don't want this lingering on and on.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.340]   But this thing, everybody at church got into it and I got curious.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.340]   I said, "What is this?"
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:08.600]   I watched, me and Esther watched it, and we got hooked.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.600]   The first one.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:15.620]   And the reason why is because at the end of everything, at the end of whatever the series
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.660]   is, how would they always end?
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.820]   Some crazy cliffhanger.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.940]   He's about to save the president and then if he doesn't do this one thing, the bomb
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.500]   is going to blow up and the clock ticks.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:37.180]   10, 9, 8, 7, then whatever else comes after that.
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.940]   And then it would go black and then say next week.
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.260]   So you have to go back to see, did he save him, not save him?
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.540]   And every one, it would end like that and it would hook you.
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:53.420]   Even if you got bored in the middle, at the very end, it would always hook you to make
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.060]   you come to the next week.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:58.100]   We got caught up in this and by the time we got to the third series, we said, "We got
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.100]   to stop.
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.700]   This is a lordship issue.
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:05.700]   We're spending way too much time with this."
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:09.420]   And just how many presidents are going to die?
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.220]   How many times is he going to save the world?
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:17.780]   But the genius behind what they did was to kind of hook you to make sure.
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:24.800]   Well, the Bible says that that's exactly what God was doing in the Old Testament.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.300]   He was implanting.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:32.460]   He was waiting for the perfect time to reveal, but he was trying to stir up, get people ready.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.060]   I mean, wouldn't that make sense if your son is about to come and give his life, the greatest
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:43.860]   thing that happened in human history, depending on what it is, you're going to spend a lot
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.820]   of time preparing.
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.140]   Those of you who got married and you're preparing for a wedding, and I know we have a bunch
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.580]   of couples now, or if you're having a kid and you know that the kid is coming in the
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:59.940]   next six months, as the time ticks, depending on how important this is, you're going to
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.140]   spend more time, more money, more energy preparing to make sure.
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:10.060]   Well, that's exactly what God was doing with Jesus.
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:14.460]   All through Israel's history, in everything that he did, everything that he did in the
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:20.380]   Old Testament was to point to and to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:25.700]   1 Peter 1, 10-11, it says, "As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:30.220]   would come to you, made careful searches and inquiries."
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:34.520]   Even as they were prophesying, what is God doing?
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.340]   They were beginning to ask questions.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.340]   What is this?
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.580]   How is this going to be revealed?
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.860]   Can you imagine Isaiah prophesying, Isaiah 53?
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:51.300]   And as he was prophesying, the Messiah is going to be slaughtered like a sheep?
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.740]   He's not going to open his mouth?
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.620]   All our iniquities are going to be laid upon him?
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.740]   What does this mean?
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:57.740]   That's exactly what he says.
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:02.020]   He said, "God gave these revelations, but even as it was coming through the prophets,
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.340]   they began to ask the question, 'What is this?
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.340]   How is this going to happen?'"
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.480]   Verse 11, "Seeking to know what person or time of the Spirit of Christ within them was
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:15.540]   indicating as he predicted the suffering of Christ and the glories to follow."
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:21.740]   He said that this mystery that was coming through the prophets was so spectacular that
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:26.220]   even caused them to ask questions.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.100]   They began to search and they began to look with envy.
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.220]   And that was God's intention.
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.220]   That was his intention.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.900]   So you can enjoy the New Testament independent of the Old Testament, just like you can watch
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.020]   Star Wars, the first one, without seeing the other ones.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.260]   But when you study the Old Testament, when you study the book of Leviticus and Israel's
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:49.740]   history and the prophets, all of a sudden you begin to see the depth of what God has
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:55.380]   been doing in history to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:01.300]   Colossians 2, 2-3, "Even in Paul's prayer, Paul's pray that their hearts may be encouraged,
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:06.100]   having been knit together in love, attaining to all the wealth that comes from the fullness
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:10.620]   assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is,
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:17.940]   Christ himself, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:25.580]   All the treasures, all the wisdom, all the knowledge is in Christ.
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:33.620]   So this mystery that is revealed isn't simply a part of human history.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:41.540]   Anything that you and I have been fooled to believe can be found in this world because
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.700]   of the lie, because of our sins and our lust.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:52.380]   He says it is found in Christ because he is the author of life.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:57.660]   All things were created by him and for him and is sustained through him.
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.900]   Jesus is the gospel.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:08.980]   So when this mystery is revealed, it is not simply a way to get to heaven.
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:14.740]   Every longing and desire in sinful man is found in Christ.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:15.740]   That's what he means.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:20.980]   All the treasures, all the wisdom, all the knowledge is found in Christ.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:27.420]   It is this mystery that he kept hidden and is now revealed.
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:33.620]   That's why nominal Christianity isn't Christianity.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.460]   Nominal Christianity is not a sub-level of Christianity.
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.260]   It is not a different part of Christianity.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.980]   It is not Christianity.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:48.300]   You can't behold this glory and walk away and say, "Well, you guys are fanatics.
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.540]   I'm just going to be average."
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:58.580]   It's not possible because it betrays what you profess to believe.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:03.460]   Either you beheld his glory and it changes everything about who you are or you didn't
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.580]   behold it.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.820]   You can love the church, you can love the people, you can love the teaching, you can
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:13.860]   love the purpose, but that's not Jesus if it doesn't change everything about who we
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.860]   are.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.860]   2 Timothy 3.7, always learning.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.340]   He's talking about the end times, these false prophets.
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:26.180]   They're always learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:31.460]   C.S. Lewis says it this way, "I believe in Christianity as I believe the sun has risen.
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:38.620]   Not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else."
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:45.780]   Beholding God's glory, I'm sure many of you can testify the same thing.
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:50.260]   Once you met the Lord, whether it was an instantaneous meeting of the Lord or whether it was a gradual
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:58.420]   unveiling of this mystery, once you met the Lord, your purpose looked different.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.540]   Your values began to change.
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:05.500]   Even why you choose a major starts to change.
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.500]   What you want from a marriage changes.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:13.140]   How you raise your kids, it changes because your perspective changes.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:17.720]   What you consider to be successful changes.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.900]   What makes you laugh changes.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:26.220]   The kind of people that you want to be around, it changes.
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:33.540]   How you view eternity, how you view your retirement, how you view life, how you view singleness,
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:39.460]   how you view marriage, it all completely changes because through the lens of Christ, everything
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:40.460]   changes.
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:44.880]   It's kind of like the light got turned on.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.580]   Before we met Christ, we were kind of functioning in the dark and we were feeling, it's like,
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.420]   "Okay, this looks like a table."
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:56.320]   You would go to the dining room table and it looks like, "Oh, this feels like a chair."
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:02.340]   But all of a sudden, when the light gets turned on, all of a sudden you see what it is.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.540]   Your whole world changes when the light gets turned on.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:10.580]   See, that's Christianity.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:16.420]   But again, the danger that you and I are in, in a post-Christian culture where there is
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:22.020]   a lot of description of what the world is supposed to be like, and a lot of people who
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:31.940]   are living in darkness can tell you and say the right things and yet have never changed
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.260]   their values.
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:38.260]   They just added Christ to whatever it was they were pursuing before because they never
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.580]   met the Lord.
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.780]   Jeremiah 29, 13, it says, "You will seek me and find me when you search me with all
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.540]   your heart."
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.340]   God is not playing hide and seek.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:55.140]   He says in the scripture, he left all these imprints and for those who are searching,
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:59.020]   like the prophets, when these prophecies were coming, they said, "What is this?"
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.740]   And they began to search and they began to search him with all their hearts.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.620]   God began to reveal it to them.
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:09.900]   But the people who are just kind of nonchalant, satisfied with their life, he says, "No,
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.580]   if you search me with all your heart."
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.700]   He left imprints and it will remain an imprint.
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.460]   It will remain a mystery.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:24.420]   He allows the veil to remain because you are not interested.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:29.900]   You know, a while back, and I don't even know the author, but I didn't even want to look
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:30.980]   it up.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:35.500]   You might have heard it where this guy wrote a book because he's not that into you.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.820]   It's a dating book, it's not a Christian book.
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:42.260]   So basically in that book, he describes if he does this, right?
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.740]   Like if you dated him and you came back and he does this, it just means he's not into
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.740]   you.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:47.740]   Don't pursue him.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.060]   Don't get hurt because he's just not into you.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.820]   And I remember hearing certain things.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:55.620]   If he met you, no matter what he said, if he leaves and he doesn't call you back in
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:59.740]   the next five days, he's just not into you.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:04.020]   Or he goes out and then he asks you to split the bill and you pay your half and I pay mine.
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.460]   He may not be that into you.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.540]   He doesn't introduce you to his friends.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.420]   You know, he always kind of meets you sideways, but when you say, "Hey, where are your friends?"
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.100]   He never wants to introduce you to your friends.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.100]   He's not that into you.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:20.060]   So he's got all these lists of things that no matter what he said to you, his actions
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:24.700]   prove he's not that into you.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:34.100]   In our faith, we nonchalantly put the minimum effort in pursuing Christ and constantly wonder
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:38.460]   why God feels so distant.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.140]   Could it be you're not that into him?
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.580]   You're not that interested?
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:51.220]   You haven't made up your mind that he is everything.
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:56.140]   Maybe that's the reason why he always feels so distant.
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.700]   You want the world and him and God made it very clear you cannot serve mammon and God
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:04.380]   at the same time and you're trying so hard and it just isn't working because you're really
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.720]   not that into him.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.960]   You want the benefit of Christianity without having Christ.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:16.780]   You want holiness without his presence and it doesn't happen.
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:23.180]   See God left it a mystery to draw those who are hungry to him and when they came, he tore
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:28.480]   the veil and he began to see and everything started to change.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.300]   It was manifested by the scriptures of prophets according to the commandments of the eternal
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:36.580]   God through his word, primarily through Christ.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:41.020]   Hebrews chapter 1, 1 through 2, God after he spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:48.540]   in many portions and in many ways in these last days has spoken to us in his son whom
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.580]   he appointed heir of all things.
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:56.380]   The primary work of the Holy Spirit is to bring this mystery to us and make it known.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:01.700]   A lot of times we think of the Holy Spirit as being emotional in the middle of worship
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.500]   like God touching us and bringing tears and yeah, we're not saying that that can't be
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:10.060]   the work of the Holy Spirit but according to Jesus, the primary work of the Holy Spirit
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.940]   is to make the revelation of Christ clear.
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:20.180]   John 14, 26, but the helper, the Holy Spirit whom the father will send in my name, talking
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:24.100]   about the Holy Spirit, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.500]   I said to you.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:32.900]   His primary work is to make the revelation of Christ clear so that when the word of God
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:41.260]   is taught that you understand it and then when you heard it that you would meditate
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:46.420]   on it and it would actually cause you to bear fruit, that you don't just hear it and then
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.340]   when you're out the door you forget about it.
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.700]   He said the work of the Holy Spirit causes it to stick into your mind and in your heart
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:56.140]   and it begins to challenge you and change you and sanctify you.
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.140]   That's the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.340]   So a lot of times people think like well because we're not emotional, we're not raising our
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:05.420]   hands and enough people are not crying, this Holy Spirit is not working.
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:11.340]   That's not what the Holy Spirit, the Bible says the Holy Spirit does primarily.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:15.240]   Let me get to the fourth and fifth point because it's kind of tagged and I'm not going to spend
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.180]   as much time on this.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.380]   Considering all that we know about the gospel and that's pretty much the summary of what
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:26.140]   Paul has said, in light of that he says this gospel is a mystery to be preached.
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:29.140]   It has been made known to all the nations.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:37.260]   So faith, Romans 10 17 comes from hearing and hearing by the word of Christ.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:46.500]   So first application of that is that the preacher upon this pulpit must preach his word.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:51.440]   My goal here is not to try to fill this room with as many people as possible.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.940]   My hope and desire is more and more people will come and hear the gospel.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:37:00.740]   But my primary purpose is to make his voice clear.
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:05.740]   Not my voice, not my experience, not the wisdom of this world, but this mystery that's been
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.940]   revealed to the world to proclaim it.
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:11.260]   That's the primary purpose of this pulpit.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:16.140]   But it doesn't end with this pulpit because you have family and friends and strangers
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:20.020]   around you that I will never reach.
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.020]   I don't know them.
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:22.260]   I don't know who they are.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.700]   And even if they came here, I preached to them from a distance.
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:34.820]   In light of this mystery that's been revealed, the gospel is to be preached.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.560]   First Corinthians 1 21, for since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:43.540]   come to know God, God was well pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.540]   save those who believe.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:52.700]   Our job, we don't have the power to save people.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:57.340]   If we just apply the right technique, if we have the right discipleship, if we're organized
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:02.300]   certain way that somehow we can add to whatever Christ was doing.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.180]   He said no.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:09.100]   The foolishness of the preaching of the cross is what brings them to Christ.
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:16.560]   So our primary purpose outside of these walls is to make sure that everybody at least understands
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.980]   this mystery, at least cognitively.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:24.860]   That nobody around you dies not knowing what the gospel is.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:32.520]   They may die rejecting the gospel, but they should not be dying not knowing the gospel.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.300]   Because he says if you know this mystery, and that's why it's called euangelion, the
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.100]   good news.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.580]   You can't hear the good news and just keep it to yourself.
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.400]   Because it was a mystery that was revealed and once it is revealed you are to spend the
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.940]   rest of the time telling as many people as possible.
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:58.780]   This gospel is to be preached, to know him and to make him known.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.780]   Whose motto is that?
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:00.780]   Does anybody know?
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.780]   Navigators.
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:07.180]   If you've ever been involved with Navigators campus ministry, it's to know him, make him
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.180]   known.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:12.420]   I've always coveted that because I wanted that to be ours.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.020]   Too many people know it so I can't take it.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.420]   To know him and to make him known.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:22.360]   That pretty much summarizes our calling.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.340]   You can't make him known if you don't know him.
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.000]   If you're not continuing to pursue him, you can't make him known.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.180]   But those two aspects have to go hand in hand.
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:34.420]   Our goal has to be constantly to know him, to understand this great mystery that has
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.500]   been revealed in depth.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:43.220]   And then the more we know, the more we are to proclaim and to teach.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:47.900]   Everything else is a distraction.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.180]   Everything else is a distraction.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.980]   Distraction doesn't mean it's sin.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.580]   But it can lead to sin.
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:04.260]   All our hobbies, all our desires, all of these things, they're not necessarily sinful.
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:10.700]   But it's a distraction because it takes us away from our primary calling, to know him
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.540]   and to make him known.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.780]   That's what he means when he says, "Whether you eat or drink, do it all for the glory
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:17.780]   of God."
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:22.940]   You know, so sometimes we compartmentalize God and so we have God things that we do and
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:27.740]   then we have the non-God things that we do and then somehow these things never overlap.
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.300]   Right?
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:34.060]   I mean, God didn't just purchase a part of your life.
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.300]   The scripture says we all belong to him.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.420]   Everything that we do, eat or drink, is for his glory.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:43.980]   Fifth and final, the gospel is to be obeyed.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:48.540]   You can't obey something that you don't believe.
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:52.660]   And here's the fundamental thing that I want to, again, encourage and challenge you.
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:58.300]   Because we're afraid to ask the question if we really believe.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:03.960]   Because if the answer to that is, "Oh, maybe I don't," means maybe you're not saved.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.260]   So that's not something that I want to even entertain.
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.860]   So we look at our life that doesn't make sense.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.820]   It doesn't make sense with what I'm reading in scripture.
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:21.260]   But when we take that, "Maybe I don't really believe," and we're trying to make sense
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:27.020]   of a life with no affection for Christ, no desire to evangelize, no desire to read his
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:34.220]   word, no desire to obey, pursuing the things of this world, and yet we can never question
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.240]   whether I really believe.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.580]   So we're trying to make sense of this.
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:46.660]   Where in the Bible it says, "If you believe, then go."
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:50.140]   So the fundamental question always is that.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:53.820]   Do you believe in that God?
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.540]   Do you believe in that God?
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:03.380]   Because when we reorient ourselves based upon our faith, what we believe, it causes us to
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.380]   rethink.
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:11.940]   If I believe that this world is temporary, why do I love it so much?
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:16.780]   If I believe that all the money in the world and all the acclamation in this world, all
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:22.060]   of it is under judgment of God, why do I cherish that so much?
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:26.300]   If I believe that the world is condemned and if they die without knowing Christ, and condemnation
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:32.140]   is waiting for them, why am I not motivated to teach them, to preach to them, to bring
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.140]   them to Christ?
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:36.340]   Why not?
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:41.580]   Is it because I don't believe, or am I so distracted with the things of this world that
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.700]   is not on my radar?
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.300]   Whatever it is, it is not normal.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.620]   It is not consistent with our faith.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:57.020]   He says to bring obedience, the mystery of the gospel is ultimately to bring us to obedience.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.580]   Let me wrap it up this way, because that's exactly what he says.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.100]   That's how Paul started this letter in Romans chapter 1, 5.
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:06.780]   "Through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:10.420]   all the Gentiles for his name's sake."
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.820]   Matthew 28, 20.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:17.380]   Baptize them, go, make disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:20.380]   Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.380]   So the end goal of discipleship is obedience.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:26.860]   The end goal of preaching the gospel is not simply to say, "Here's believers, here's the
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:32.660]   non-believers, here's the atheists, and here are the theists."
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.020]   It's to bring us to obedience.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:40.940]   So let me wrap this up, because the way he wraps it up is ultimately pointing to God.
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:44.980]   "That has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience to the faith, to the
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.660]   only wise God through Jesus Christ be the glory forever.
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.660]   Amen."
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:57.100]   And all of this culminates in human history, ends with this, "To the only wise God through
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.780]   Jesus Christ be the glory forever.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.700]   Amen."
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:09.960]   The goal, ultimate purpose of the revelation of this mystery is for his glory.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:15.060]   And it all points back to Genesis chapter 1 and 2.
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.140]   God created the universe, what?
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.220]   To reflect his glory.
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.980]   He made man in his own image.
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:26.260]   And then when man rebelled against God, we can no longer bear his glory.
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.020]   And that's exactly what it says, right?
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.020]   All have sinned and fall short of what?
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.480]   God's glory.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:35.080]   So when we are restored, that glory is restored.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.580]   So how is that glory restored?
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:38.020]   How did we lose it?
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:44.140]   We lost it because mankind decided that he wanted to be the object of worship.
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:52.580]   And you can summarize all of human rebellion as pursuing his glory.
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:56.140]   Isn't that why we covet?
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.940]   Isn't that oftentimes the source of our depression?
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.660]   Isn't that the source of contention?
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.740]   Isn't that the source of frustration?
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:14.300]   Isn't that ultimately the source of lying and slandering and oftentimes murder and theft?
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:21.260]   Because we're pursuing our own glory and somebody else and something else or some circumstance
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.540]   is getting in the way.
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:30.500]   So when we pursue our happiness, when we pursue our own glory, it leads to the exact opposite
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.500]   of what we think it's going to achieve.
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.740]   And that's what Jesus said, "If you seek your own life, you will find death."
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:46.140]   But if you die in the name of Jesus, you will find life in him.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:51.900]   You and I were not made to be worshipped.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:46:00.420]   As much as that sounds attractive, to be the center of attention on a pedestal with people
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:04.020]   clapping hands and saying, "Wow, you're so awesome."
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:11.940]   As much as that may be appealing to us, we want to play football, we want to be the captain.
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.540]   We want to be a multimillionaire, drive nice car.
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.540]   We want to be the tallest, we want to be the most handsome, we want to be the most talented.
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:21.980]   And we bring that even into the church.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:26.300]   We want to be recognized, we want to become leaders.
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:34.020]   All of that at the source is human rebellion, wanting to be worshipped rather than be worshippers.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:39.220]   The gospel, the mystery that is revealed, it flips that script and turns it back to
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.780]   what God intended.
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.420]   We put God on his throne.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:50.100]   That's the end goal of human history, is to put God back on his throne and take ourselves
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.340]   off.
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:54.060]   And we think, "Oh, that's kind of egotistical.
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:47:00.900]   I mean, of course we all want to be the center of attention."
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:08.060]   Think about how freeing it is if you didn't have to worry about your hair.
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.060]   Something as trivial as that.
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.500]   It's like, "No, no, no, I don't want to."
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:16.540]   If you didn't have to worry about other people, think about how much time, energy is spent
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.100]   to make sure that your hair is a certain way every morning.
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:22.180]   It'd probably save you at least 30 minutes.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:27.820]   So some guy is just kind of like, "I'm sick of this."
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:33.160]   I think about something as trivial as your hair and how much time and effort goes into
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:39.940]   making sure your hair is a certain way, combed a certain way, your skin, your pants.
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.940]   Is it tight enough?
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.380]   All right.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:51.180]   I made myself laugh.
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:48:03.980]   Imagine how much time and effort goes into wanting attention a certain way.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:08.580]   Imagine being freed from all of that.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.500]   Imagine being freed from all of that.
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.860]   How that would affect your marriage.
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.920]   How that would affect your friendship.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.860]   How that would affect your work.
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:25.260]   And how that ultimately affects your life.
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:30.620]   Don't you think what Jesus says, "He who knows the truth, they are disciples of mine."
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:31.620]   Right?
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:35.980]   "And they shall know the truth and the truth shall set them free."
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.020]   What is he setting us free from?
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.940]   From the sin.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:46.020]   The sin of rebellion against God to glorify himself.
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:50.560]   So what's going to save us from this desire to be glorified?
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:55.940]   Is to reveal a glory that is so much better than us.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:00.180]   So much better than what we can possibly imagine.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:05.300]   That we don't trick ourselves to pursue that.
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:12.700]   That we notice something so much more than us that all of a sudden we just forget.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:18.000]   Isn't that what Paul means in light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ?
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.920]   Everything else became rubbish.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:24.820]   And the reason why it's not rubbish is because we keep going back and looking at it and forgetting
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:29.600]   who Jesus is.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.280]   That's the point of the gospel.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:37.620]   That's why he had it hidden and then all of a sudden now it's revealed.
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:41.920]   So that those who have seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ would want nothing
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:47.280]   more than that glory every single day.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:51.160]   To the only wise God through Jesus Christ be the glory forever.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.160]   Amen.
