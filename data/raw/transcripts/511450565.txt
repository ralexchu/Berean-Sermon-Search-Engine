[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.240]   Alright, as we start our introduction to 2 Thessalonians, the inductive Bible study,
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.880]   you probably already have done your homework, you had your discussion, and so I wanted to
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.520]   clarify that the Bible study going forward, this recording will not be the Bible study.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.760]   This recording is just going to be highlighting, maybe giving some pointers, just kind of help
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.960]   wrap things up, but if you rely on this to do your Bible study, you're not going to be
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.560]   able to participate in what's happening in the home groups or the small groups.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.400]   We want the church to be able to be truly Bereans, not Berean as members, obviously
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.320]   we're talking about Acts 17 and 11 where they examined everything to see if they were from
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.800]   God's Word, to test everything.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.160]   And so in order to do that, we can't just accept doctrine and say what's biblical and
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.920]   not biblical because it makes sense to us or doesn't make sense to us, or you trust
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.940]   one leader over another leader.
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.520]   Our confidence really needs to be from God's Word, and the only way to ensure that is if
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.320]   every Christian knows what the Word of God says.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.080]   And so we want everyone to come to Bible study, committed to do inductive Bible study, not
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.760]   to attend Bible study, but to committed to study and to be able to dig and ask questions.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.520]   So again, it may be a little bit more tedious, it may require a little bit more work on your
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.920]   part, but again, God has invested and ordained His very breath, according to God's Word,
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.600]   into His Word.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.640]   So it is not possible to know God without committing to know His Word.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.240]   There's so much you can learn from sermons, from experience, when you don't fully grasp
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.300]   His heart in what He intended in His Word.
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.720]   And so again, all of this is to just encourage you.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.520]   So if you're in the habit of just attending Bible study, to really commit to do the inductive
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.840]   Bible study.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.320]   So let's look at first, just again as a wrap up, and I'm not going to be pointing to every
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.440]   single part of the text, but just kind of give you a highlight.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.840]   You know, we talked about in 1 Thessalonians, it's good to know the background behind Silvanus
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.020]   and Timothy.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.920]   So don't skim over the introduction, because there's a lot in there that kind of helps
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.000]   you to understand the mindset of what's going on.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.520]   So knowing Paul, Silvanus, Timothy, their relationship, who they are, how old are they,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.080]   why did they join?
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.800]   Silvanus joined for the second missionary journey along with Timothy, but Timothy was
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.760]   a lifelong companion ever since he met him.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.960]   And Silvanus was a peer of Paul that was sent with him to give the letter to the Gentile
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.680]   churches that they didn't have to be circumcised to become Christians.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.520]   And then the greetings, "Grace to you and peace."
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.680]   Again, we learned last time that the term "grace" was a common greeting from the Greek
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.480]   world, and "peace," "shalom," was a common greeting from the Jewish world.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.760]   So Apostle Paul has created a unique greeting with a combination of the Gentile world and
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.680]   the Jewish world, "grace" and "peace."
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.640]   But along with that, even the greeting in itself contains the gospel message, because
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.640]   the Jews were constantly looking for peace, for "shalom" from God, and the only way
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.640]   to get that was from grace.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.540]   And so even in the very introduction, "grace and peace to you," is pretty much a simple
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.360]   summary of the gospel.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:08.360]   In verse 1 and 2, asking a lot of questions is helpful.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.960]   What I highlighted here is the preposition "in" and "from."
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.400]   This is something that I noticed that even as I was preparing this video, I looked at
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.600]   this text so many times throughout the years.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.360]   I've probably done inductive bio-study in 1st and 2nd Thessalonians probably over a
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.320]   dozen times.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.480]   But for whatever reason, I've always asked the question, "to the church of the Thessalonians,
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.040]   in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.440]   And then he says the same thing again, "grace to you and peace from God the Father and the
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.000]   Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.320]   And why is it here, "in God the Father" and here, "from God the Father?"
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:54.160]   And I realized that what he was saying here is not Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, who
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.560]   is "in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.160]   He was actually saying, "to the church of the Thessalonians, in God our Father and the
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.160]   Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.200]   So again, I don't know if you missed this, but I definitely did.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.320]   That he's basically saying that the Thessalonians who are "in God the Father," and then he's
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.320]   saying "we're bringing grace to you from God the Father."
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.560]   So even in the introduction, Apostle Paul basically is acknowledging that all of this
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.960]   is because of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.480]   He's sending greetings from God the Father to the church who is "in God the Father."
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.440]   And this sovereignty of God, that all of this is happening because of what God is doing
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   in their midst.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.400]   And that's why it leads to the second part of it, where he's compelled to give thanks.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.640]   So again, it may be a simple introduction, but even in the simple introduction, it kind
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.760]   of gives us the theological mindset of the author and how that affects his perspective
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.160]   on all these different things.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:05.160]   All right, in verse 3 and 4, I did the sentence structure for you.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:12.320]   And again, get in the habit of dividing each verse into main parts of the speech and what
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   are supporting phrases.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.960]   And it'll kind of help you to focus in on the study.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.400]   So if you look at verse 3, it says "we ought always to give thanks," which is the main
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.680]   phrase here.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.240]   And then why does he give thanks?
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.900]   Because if your faith is being enlarged and love for each one of you grows ever greater.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.000]   So that's the main thing.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.600]   So you could make this sentence without these fillers, right?
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.960]   Where like, who are you giving thanks to God?
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.080]   Because it's fitting and because of faith, love toward one another.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.760]   So you can see the main parts of the speech, right?
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.640]   And then focus on these as supporting what he's saying.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.920]   So giving thanks because of their faith and because of love.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:04.920]   And same thing with verse 4, it says "we speak proudly of you for their perseverance and
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.680]   their faith," right?
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.000]   And so here it describes their perseverance and faith in the midst of persecution and
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.280]   affliction, right?
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.160]   Here it says "we speak proudly of you to the other churches."
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:25.640]   So after you've done that, it's easier to focus your attention and ask good questions
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.960]   because the verse kind of like, instead of seeing one big blob of two, three verses,
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.040]   you can see it in the sentence structure of what's going on.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:40.040]   So here, you know, we talked about, at least in our Homegroup Leaders group, "ought always
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   to give thanks."
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.840]   And again, it's good to be in a habit of having several translations open.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.720]   So you can see that there's something going on in the text, and that's kind of like your
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.000]   first line after you've done the sentence structure to see what's going on.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.440]   The word "ought" here talks about, has an idea of being compelled or obligated to give
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.960]   thanks.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.480]   And he's compelled and obligated to give thanks to God because it's only fitting.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.440]   It's the right thing to do, right?
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.720]   And you know, we can say it's easier to do that because Thessalonians was a model church,
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.720]   right?
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.040]   And he says he's giving thanks for two reasons, because of their faith being enlarged and
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.680]   because of love.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.640]   And that's basically what he is saying here.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:35.400]   But if you look at 1 Corinthians 1, verse 4, Apostle Paul also has a couple of verses
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.040]   where he gives the same kind of phrase here about the Corinthians.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.600]   And so if you know anything about the Corinthians, it was, Corinthians is probably one of the
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.880]   harshest letters that Apostle Paul wrote.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.940]   And even there, he begins by being thankful.
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.920]   And I think this idea is related to what he says in verse 1 and 2 in the beginning, when
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.280]   he recognizes that the Thessalonians are in God the Father, that he is being sent from
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.520]   God the Father and the Son.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:09.080]   And so he sees God who's working behind the scenes, even when there is struggle, persecution
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:15.320]   and affliction going on, that his thankfulness is not necessarily just because he sees that
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:21.440]   they're responding well, but he sees evidence of God's grace and his love in them.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.680]   And that's why he feels compelled and it's only fitting for a Christian to have a thankful
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.440]   heart because Thanksgiving obviously is directly related to our ability to worship.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.280]   An individual who is not thankful is an individual who cannot worship, right?
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.200]   So here he says he's obligated to give thanks.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.080]   And it's only fitting to do that because the faith is greatly enlarged, that it's growing,
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.080]   right?
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.160]   They didn't just have faith and have the same faith for 30, 40 years, but faith can, if
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.640]   it can grow, it can probably decrease, right?
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.280]   The effects of the faith.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.320]   So he says their faith is being enlarged, right?
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.380]   And their love for one another is also growing.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:07.140]   So there's progress from the first Thessalonians that when he writes, right, he was very thankful
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.140]   for them.
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.540]   But when he writes second Thessalonians, he says he's compelled to give thanks because
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.380]   he sees progress in them.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.020]   Even though they were a model church, they were growing continually.
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.160]   And he speaks proudly of them among the other churches, right?
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.900]   So his Thanksgiving wasn't just like obligation only.
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.140]   He was being forced to say something they didn't really mean.
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.340]   Or else he wouldn't be speaking proudly of them in other churches.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.460]   Now we've already done an overview of second Thessalonians and we know that there were
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.620]   problems in this church, right?
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.940]   There's false doctrines being penetrated.
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:48.460]   Some people were not living disciplined lives and so they need to be disciplined.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:56.360]   There's concerns about the persecution and encouragement to persevere.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.060]   And so it wasn't like the second Thessalonians didn't have problems.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:07.200]   But Apostle Paul was able to fix his eyes on God's sovereign plan that he has them completed
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.720]   and he sees God working in them.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.540]   And that's why he's able to be thankful.
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.220]   And remember that when he was writing this, he was in Corinth.
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.440]   So if you know anything about Paul in Corinth, he was beaten up.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   He was tired.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.060]   He was burned out.
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.660]   And Jesus actually had to tell him to continue to do the ministry.
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:29.040]   And that's why he kind of stayed in Corinth for a long period of time because it was sort
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.540]   of a way for him to recuperate.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.480]   And so he was not in the best of condition in Corinth.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:39.340]   So when he is writing this letter, humanly speaking, you would think that there's a lot
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.140]   of frustrations and things being poured out in these letters.
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:47.640]   But again, Paul is genuinely thankful because he sees God's sovereign hand in what's going
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.640]   on with them.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:55.380]   And then so again, here, just like in verse three, he gives thanks because of their faith
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.380]   and love.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.980]   And here he says, I'm proudly speaking of you, bragging of you to the other churches
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.500]   because of their perseverance and the evidence of their faith in the midst of persecution
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.340]   and affliction, which they endure.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.580]   So again, there's a lot more stuff going on in here.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:16.980]   But I think just to kind of give you an idea of how to break down the verse, and I know
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.780]   you've already had the discussion and this is more for, you know, hopefully going forward,
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:26.160]   you would apply this to the next passage in verses five through ten.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:33.780]   So I kind of wanted to give a summary of what's going on here in the next slide.
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:38.860]   It's good to get in the habit after you've done your studies, you've asked questions,
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:46.380]   observations, and cross-references and application, you know, to kind of wrap up the study into
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.540]   the highlights of what you learned here.
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.300]   I put four down that I briefly discussed.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.940]   The relationship between Paul and Silvanus and Timothy as co-workers of the gospel.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.100]   That was, again, something that we paid attention to in verse one.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:05.740]   Paul's view of God's sovereignty in his work and in the work of Thessalonians, where I
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:11.980]   talked about in and then from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, and how that perspective
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.940]   really resonates in everything else that he sees and what he's thankful for.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.940]   Thanksgiving that is compelled by what he sees God doing in their midst.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:25.180]   So not necessarily because of human work, but he's thankful to God for what he's doing
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.180]   in their midst.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:31.740]   And then fourthly, growing faith, evidence by perseverance and through affliction, an
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.020]   increase of love for one another.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:41.220]   And so basically, these are the four main points and application in my life should really
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.180]   be coming from these main points, right?
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:49.460]   So the fact that Apostle Paul always had companions working, who are my co-workers and what is
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.940]   my relationship with them?
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.700]   God's sovereignty, right?
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.740]   Am I absolutely convinced of his sovereignty?
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:01.420]   Is this just a doctrinal statement or does that actually affect the way I perceive everything,
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.720]   good and bad?
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:09.180]   When it's hard, when it's easy, do I actually believe that God is fully in control?
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:14.500]   And does that show in the way that I talk, in the way that I view things, the way I hope
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.740]   for, what makes me sad, what makes me happy?
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.900]   How does God's sovereignty affect all of that?
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.180]   Thanksgiving.
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:30.540]   Is my life and my speech being compelled by Thanksgiving because I believe that God is
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:34.140]   sovereign and what is happening?
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:39.620]   And then the evidence of faith, like, am I persevering in affliction?
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:45.100]   Am I just putting up with it or do I genuinely see God's sovereign hand in the affliction
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.780]   that is happening?
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.540]   Is there an increase in love?
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:56.580]   Not just to tolerate difficult situations or difficult people, but is there an urging
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:01.220]   or compelling or movement toward greater love in my life?
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:08.340]   And so those are things that for application, once we've done the study, like, how do we
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.340]   apply these things?
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:23.860]   So again, like I've always said, right, application without interpretation is abortion.
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:29.540]   Interpretation without application is abortion because then you haven't completed your study.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:36.580]   And then application without interpretation will be a miscarriage.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.940]   And so that's what my professor would always say in our hermeneutics class.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.500]   And so we want to make sure that every study is concluded by application.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:50.940]   So this is something that I strongly encourage you to do for every study.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:59.460]   I just wanted to give you a quick guide for the study of verses 5 through 10 for the coming
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.460]   week.
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.020]   It's a little bit lengthier than most other verses that you're going to be looking at
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.380]   throughout the study.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:12.540]   So whenever you do a large chunk like this, it's helpful to, again, to break it down into
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.380]   sentence structure.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.500]   And what are the main points?
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.020]   What are supporting clauses?
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.780]   And make sure that once you outline it like that, it'll give you a clear direction of
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.640]   what's going on in the text.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:31.300]   So one of the main things that I encourage you to do is to get a good summary of this
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.300]   text.
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.300]   What's the main point?
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.300]   Right.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.460]   What are the major points and what are the sub points?
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.980]   And then once you've identified that, then you can go back from verse to verse and then
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.900]   ask the question, do the observations cross references.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:49.980]   But when you have a larger text that you're dealing with, before you do verse by verse,
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.780]   make sure you get the complete thought flow that's going on in this text.
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:59.900]   So again, once you've identified that, I think the other study that you will do in more detail
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.440]   will be helpful.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.280]   So that's the first thing that I encourage you to do.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:11.980]   And no matter what you do, you can't speed up your devotion.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.220]   You have to commit to do it.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.940]   You can't just look at this text and sit in front of it for 10 minutes and hoping that
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.740]   you'll be able to get all these insights.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:26.420]   So especially in the Bible study, the more time you put into digging and meditating on
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.940]   the text, more insights you'll get.
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:34.300]   And I encourage you to do this early on because sometimes you'll read through it and then
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.740]   you'll have it in your head.
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.020]   And then as you're driving, you'll have a thought that's connected to something that
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.900]   you read.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.220]   And it'll make a lot more sense the more you take time to meditate on it.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:50.180]   So I encourage you to start this sentence structure and get the main overview and do
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.980]   it early so that you'll be able to get as much out of this text as you can.
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.580]   Because this has so many good things in this text and I don't want you to miss out on it
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.580]   by skimming on it.
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.580]   Okay.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.580]   Okay.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.080]   Thank you.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
