[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Alright, so Leviticus chapter 15.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:29.240]   Alright, so the purpose of all the laws regarding the bodily discharge that we're talking about
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.440]   in chapter 15 is summarized at the end of the chapter in verse 31.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.200]   So in 31 it says, "Thus you shall keep the people of Israel separate from their uncleanness,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.920]   lest they die in their uncleanness by defiling by tabernacle that is in their midst."
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.320]   So there's two things that are told us here, to keep the people of Israel clean.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.700]   Again this is not just a summary of chapter 15, but all the chapters that we've been talking
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.760]   about uncleanness.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.580]   So how many chapters we're talking about uncleanness up to this point?
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.400]   You remember?
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.980]   What chapter did we start with the uncleanness?
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.520]   Chapter 11, right?
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.000]   Chapter 11, anybody remember what chapter 11 was about?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Food and animals.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.560]   All you have to do is flip through your Bible, okay?
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.080]   The food and animals, which are unclean foods and which are unclean animals.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:41.060]   And then chapter 12 was about uncleanness and childbearing, right?
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.120]   And then chapter 13 and 14, we were just there, about leprosy.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.200]   Chapter 13 is about diagnosing leprosy and then chapter 14 is about restoration back
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.480]   into society if it gets healed.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.880]   And so chapter 15 is a summary, is the last part of the series on the uncleanness.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.800]   What makes you clean and what makes you unclean?
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.400]   And so he spells out the reason why all of this was given is to keep Israel clean, right?
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.760]   And again, the idea of cleanness is to be set apart, to be different from the rest of
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.760]   the world.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   We're going to get into that at the end of the Bible study and why this is so significant,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.760]   right?
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.120]   And so he spells out at the very end, in conclusion of chapter 11 through 15, that the first reason
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.580]   given why all of these is given is to keep you separate, make you clean.
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.800]   The second reason is given, the second part, is to prevent death by defiling God's holy
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   tabernacle.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.240]   Remember when we started the book of Leviticus, right?
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.600]   Remember in Exodus, God establishes a tabernacle, but he's up in the mountain?
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.280]   Book of Leviticus, God comes down and he's speaking from the tabernacle, but they can't
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.160]   come in because it's not established yet.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.300]   And then we go to Numbers, God calls them into the tabernacle.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.080]   So the whole purpose of this tabernacle is so that God's holy presence can dwell with
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.960]   his people.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.600]   And if the people are not clean, if they are not covered and they're not clean, what would
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.740]   happen to them?
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.980]   They would die, right?
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.220]   So basically what he is saying here is that the purpose of these laws is so, one, so that
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.520]   they would be kept clean, and secondly, so they would not die in their uncleanness when
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.620]   in the presence of God.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.620]   Understand?
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:33.420]   Okay, so that's pretty much the summary of the last four chapters that we were looking at.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.940]   So just as a quick review, chapter 11 through 15, it varies in seriousness and duration.
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.420]   All of the laws were to describe or teachings about how to identify what is clean and unclean,
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.940]   but they are all varying in seriousness and duration.
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.220]   So the first one, we start in chapter 11, the uncleanness that is talked about with
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.140]   the animals are permanent, right?
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.220]   The food and the animals.
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.080]   So this was a regular part of who they were, and it was a permanent part of their lives,
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.740]   so this never changes.
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.100]   These animals who are declared unclean are unclean permanently, and these certain things
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.300]   that he says are clean are clean permanently.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:25.220]   The second one, that's with chapter 12, again, depending on what was going on through childbirth,
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.060]   it could last up to 80 days.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.600]   It was not permanent, but the duration was a bit longer.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:43.820]   And then chapter 13, the skin disease, could be permanent because there was no cure for it,
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.540]   and the duration could have been permanent, ultimately leading to death, unless God showed
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.700]   mercy and the skin disease gets cured.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.160]   And then the final one today in chapter 15, that it deals with uncleanness associated
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:04.180]   with discharge, associated with reproduction, which only lasts one day or up to seven days.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.620]   So considering all the different laws that were given to us starting from chapter 11,
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.380]   chapter 15 is probably the lightest of all the laws, and the consequences of it is probably
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.100]   the lightest.
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.560]   Because if you were defiled in any way, the duration in which you were to be isolated
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.220]   or to be unclean, most of the time would have been just one day.
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.140]   You would have just washed your hands and washed your clothes, taken a bath, and you
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.500]   would have been considered unclean until the rest of the night, and then tomorrow morning
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.940]   you would be considered clean, unless you had some abnormal discharge, and that would
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.300]   take you about seven days, and the eighth day you would be restored.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.780]   And same thing with the women.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.140]   Now again, all of this is going to mean something at the end, but for the time being, just as
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.900]   a summary of what is stated in chapter 15.
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:04.980]   So out of all the four different types of uncleanness, this is probably the lightest.
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.620]   The seriousness of the leprosy that we looked at in verse 13 and 14 points to the need for
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.620]   justification.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:19.240]   Remember we talked about how other than the mercy of God, there was no cure for leprosy?
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.460]   And every part of the law of leprosy, the ugliness of what it brought and the damage
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:32.380]   that it created, the isolation, and ultimately they were cast out outside the camp, and all
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:39.060]   they had to do, were able to do, is either wait for the disease to take its course and
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.460]   then slowly deteriorate and die, or somehow by the mercy of God, God would bring healing
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.460]   and then they would be restored.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.620]   So all of it, chapter 13 and 14, is a point to our utter helplessness without God, ultimately
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.340]   points to justification.
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:01.980]   Today in chapter 15, the uncleanness is not as serious, the remedy is less rigorous, has
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.820]   no need for isolation, and it's only temporary.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.700]   None of the stuff that's mentioned here is permanent.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.580]   It reminds God's people of the consistent need for purification, which points to, ultimately,
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.260]   sanctification.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:24.420]   So chapter 13 and 14, if we were to spiritualize and say, "Well, what does leprosy and all
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.140]   the laws of that point to?"
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.820]   Ultimately, it points to justification, that we're utterly helpless until God steps in
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.140]   and does His work.
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:41.380]   Chapter 15 points to a constant need for purification, again, which Jesus mentions in chapter 13,
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.740]   10, with the disciples, "The one who has bathed does not need to wash except for his feet,
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.380]   but is completely clean, and you are clean, but not every one of you."
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.380]   Obviously, he's talking to Judas.
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.460]   So if you are a genuine believer, meaning that you have bathed, and you don't need to
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.460]   continually bathe, but you need to wash.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:07.340]   And so when Jesus said that, it clearly points to this aspect of purification, that need
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:12.540]   to constantly go, but doesn't need justification.
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:17.540]   On 15.3, "Already you are clean, because the word that I have spoken to you."
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.580]   I'm talking about their salvation.
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:26.020]   So the way God describes salvation as clean and unclean, clearly pointing to the laws
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.580]   in the book of Leviticus.
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:35.740]   Again, all of this is just a summary of what is stated in chapter 15.
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.380]   In the four central sections of chapter 15, there is the definition.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:44.580]   Again, this is a rough outline of hopefully what you read before you came here.
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.580]   There's definition of the types of contamination, and there's four types that he talks about.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.340]   There's descriptions of the consequences, if these things are happening, what you need
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.420]   to do, and an explanation of how to appropriate right of purification.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.460]   So it falls into largely three parts.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:08.940]   Definition, description of consequence, and how to remedy that.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.220]   And the remedy was pretty simple.
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.220]   Washing and then waiting until evening.
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:22.100]   They needed to wash, they needed to wash their hands, they needed to take a bath, and they
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.060]   needed to wash their clothes, and then they needed to wait until evening, if somehow they
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.540]   were contaminated.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:35.900]   So again, out of the four different rituals, this one was probably the lightest.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.100]   It doesn't mean that it wasn't important, in fact it has huge consequences, which we'll
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.100]   talk about later.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:46.260]   But I want you to understand, remember, the book of Leviticus is written in what kind
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.260]   of form?
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.820]   What do you call that?
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.500]   Chiastic form, right?
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:59.180]   Chiastic meaning you have point one, two, three, and then where's the main point?
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.900]   In the middle, and then it mimics the first part of it in the opposite direction, the
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.700]   second part, right?
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.340]   And the punchline is in the middle.
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:15.300]   So remember the chiastic form, chapter 1 through 15, is in reference to what?
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.780]   Tabernacle, right?
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:24.780]   Cleanliness of tabernacle, sacrifices, the priesthood, and then all of these rules are
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:29.060]   about how they ought to or not enter into the tabernacle.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.640]   Now we're going to see all of this in the reverse order.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:38.120]   Chapter 17 and going on, it's going to be talking about how to be clean, but this time,
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.840]   instead of talking about how to enter the tabernacle, it's talking about daily life.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.320]   Do you understand?
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.680]   So it's going to mimic, the subject is going to be mimicked in the opposite order, except
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:54.440]   the point of chapter 1 through 15 is from the perspective of the tabernacle.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.760]   How you ought to be clean in order to participate in the community in the tabernacle, and then
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:05.800]   chapter 17 to the end of the book is going to be talking about purification and cleanness
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.640]   in the daily life of the individual.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.760]   You understand?
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:19.520]   Now why I'm telling you this, because up to this point, he doesn't talk about if you became
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.500]   pure willfully, what happens.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.840]   It just tells you if you are impure, this is what you need to do in order to come back
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.960]   into the tabernacle.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.360]   As we go and we mimic the same subject in the opposite order, he's going to be talking
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.760]   about when you break this command, what the consequences are as far as sin is concerned.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.400]   Does that make sense?
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.920]   Because this side is just talking about society.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.400]   These are the laws that you ought to keep.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.560]   This is what happens if you don't keep the law, or if something happens to you that you
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.060]   need to go through this and be cleansed.
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:00.180]   On this side, there's personal responsibility.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.800]   If that went over your head, just keep it in your mind, and later on when we get to
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.840]   it I think it will make more sense to you.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   Okay?
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.840]   Yes?
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:15.640]   Alright, some of you.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:21.280]   Chapter 15, and the whole book of Leviticus is written in the chiastic form.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.720]   Chapter 15 itself is written in the chiastic form.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:32.240]   The first two cases concern continuing occasional omission of the male, then an end is followed
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:38.880]   with the last two cases that reverses this order dealing with female, meaning verse 18
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.840]   is at the center of the chiastic structure, which is highlighted in the sexual relations
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.920]   between man and woman.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.200]   To give you a quick outline, that's what the outline looks like.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:56.440]   The beginning of chapter begins with chapter 1-15 talking about the abnormal, not normal
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:02.560]   discharge from the male, and then 16-17 talking about not because of any kind of disease,
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.160]   but the normal discharge of semen, and then it talks about verse 18.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:16.880]   Again, it connects the man and the woman in verse 18 with sexual relations and the fluids
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.480]   that come from that, how that makes them unclean, and then it reverses the order with the female,
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.400]   with the normal female discharge, with the abnormal female discharge.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:31.720]   Talking about menstruation in verse 19-24, and then abnormal menstruation in verse 25-30.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.120]   Okay?
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.320]   Following?
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:41.680]   So the point of this is verse 18.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:47.960]   So everything that is taught centers around what is being taught in verse 18.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:56.680]   So we are supposed to read chapter 15 understanding the main point of all of these laws is to
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:02.680]   give us a clear understanding of sexual relationship between man and woman.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.680]   Okay?
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.680]   I thought you'd be more excited about this subject.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   Alright.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.680]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.680]   Okay.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.040]   So I'm going to come back and repeat this so that you'll have a better understanding,
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.920]   but this is one of those chapters that if you just skim through it, I mean there's so
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.960]   much contained in chapter 11 through chapter 15 that if you skim through it, I guarantee
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.640]   you your understanding of the gospel is going to be superficial.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.800]   I'm sure many of you have already caught that, that so much of the language and so much of
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.120]   the teaching in the New Testament comes directly out of the book of Leviticus, and there's
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.280]   bits and pieces of the gospel that you probably didn't understand until you start talking
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.480]   to a Jehovah's Witness or somebody starts challenging your view of the gospel, and then
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.760]   you realize you don't have a good answer, right?
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.960]   Because you don't fully understand.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.280]   You just kind of accept that God loved you and died for you, you know, and then he was
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:02.000]   buried, he was raised, great, I love him, I'm going to go to heaven, which is all true,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.160]   but until you actually challenge that, well, what does it mean?
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.160]   Why did he have to die?
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.920]   Why the shedding of blood?
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.920]   Why the death?
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.360]   What does the resurrection mean?
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.460]   What does it mean to be clean or unclean?
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.440]   So all of this language that's embedded and used repeatedly in the New Testament, you
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.320]   probably just kind of heard it, and you've heard it so many times, you just kind of assumed
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.100]   you knew, but if you go witnessing and talk to non-Christians on a regular basis, I'm
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:31.040]   pretty sure you're very familiar with a lot of the stuff that I'm already saying, because
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.840]   a lot of times if you talk to people with different religion or a false gospel, you're
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.120]   going to get into these subjects.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.120]   But if you're living in isolation and you rarely share the gospel with anybody, you
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.960]   probably have holes all over your understanding of the gospel, but you just don't know where
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.360]   they are, right?
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.920]   And that's why the book of Leviticus is so important, because it gives you a deeper understanding
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.720]   of what you already profess to believe, right?
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:04.760]   Again, I say this over and over again because I know how easily we can get lost in the book
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.720]   of Leviticus, thinking like, "Oh, what is the point of this, about this discharge?
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:16.760]   Oh, we learned about menstruation today, men in their semen secretion, that's what we learned
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.760]   about today."
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.880]   But what is the point of this, right?
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:27.240]   Again, remember I talked about in my sermon a couple weeks ago why sexual immorality was
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:34.000]   so emphasized in the New Testament, considering there's murder, stealing, robbing, I mean
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.960]   all sorts of horrendous things that human beings could commit against one another, why
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.640]   this sexual relationship, sexual deviation is highlighted in the New Testament to be
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.080]   one of the greatest sins.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.920]   We're going to get to that, right?
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.600]   But just to give you an outline of all of this.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:03.520]   Now, I forgot to mention, all of this ultimately points to what is clean and what is unclean.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:13.480]   We talked about food, giving birth, disease, and then now sexual relations.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:20.640]   All four of these things are a part of everyday part of human life.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.800]   These aren't things that you just see rarely, these are things that majority of it you wouldn't
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.160]   be able to survive without it.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.400]   Food and even disease.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.640]   This is normal part of living in a fallen world.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.520]   Giving birth, we wouldn't be here without that.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.580]   Sexual relations is obviously what leads to all of that.
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:51.960]   So all of these laws that govern what's between in human existence, what is clean and unclean,
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.640]   are the essentials of human life.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:02.000]   So when you think about, as a Jew, when these commandments were given, what is clean and
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.760]   unclean, these are not deviations from human life where you went somewhere and you went
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.960]   up to the mountains or you ran into something or some strange jellyfish bit you in the arm
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.640]   or something and then you became unclean.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.760]   We're talking about essential things that you can't survive with that would make you
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.080]   unclean.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   So think about it as a Jew who was in that system, who was taught that for hundreds of
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:35.640]   years, where they were concerned about where they went to.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.560]   If they went into a house, do they have pork in here?
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.800]   That would make them unclean.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.920]   If there's a woman during menstruation, that's unclean.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.800]   Do they just have sexual relations?
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.920]   Then I can't sit on this bed.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.120]   The guy who was unclean was just in here and he touched this table.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.480]   By touching that table, it makes me unclean.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.040]   We're hungry, I need to eat this.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.760]   But then you're in a Gentile home, they don't distinguish between clean and unclean.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:08.960]   So if they bring something on the plate that is considered unclean, you would become unclean.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.960]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.080]   Think about it as a Jew.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:20.760]   If this was part of your daily diet and basically your core of your existence and it says that
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.200]   if you do this, you become unclean, if you do this, you're clean and you had all of these
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.760]   elaborate systems to get by.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.200]   It wasn't just kind of like you became unclean and you said, "Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   have touched that.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.640]   I won't do that again."
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.960]   Every time you became unclean, even this, even though this was the lightest of the commandments,
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.480]   you had to wash your hands, you had to take a bath, you had to go put all the clothes
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.960]   in laundry, and you had to wait till evening.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.880]   And no one could touch you that day.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.480]   And this is the lightest of all the commandments.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.200]   But the minimum requirement was you take a bath, wash, change your clothes.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.960]   And again, we're not talking about people today where you have all different kinds of
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.440]   wardrobes and if you get one dirty, you just put one in the laundry and put another one
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.440]   in.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.960]   Majority of the people only owned one item of clothing.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.520]   So if they became unclean, what happened to them?
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.560]   You sat around naked, basically.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.360]   I mean, you sat around naked or you put a blanket over, you have to sit there in isolation
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.440]   because nobody can touch you, right?
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.440]   You can't sit anywhere.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.200]   No one could be in the room because wherever you sat, they're going to become unclean.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:36.440]   So imagine the psychology of a Jew during the time of Christ.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.480]   Now you understand why the Jews didn't want to go through Samaria.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.240]   You understand?
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:48.240]   If they went through Samaria and they ended up touching something of the Gentiles, it
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.240]   would have made them unclean.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.800]   They couldn't worship God.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.320]   They became hungry and they needed to go.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:58.340]   They go to a restaurant and then something is served and they didn't distinguish between
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:03.000]   clean and unclean.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.680]   It naturally separated Israel from the rest of the world.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:16.280]   It naturally separated Israel from any other nation because Israel was the only country
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.860]   that practiced this to this extent.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:24.280]   Remember what God told Israel when they go into the Promised Land to do what?
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.240]   To be separate.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.680]   To be separate.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   To be holy.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   To be set apart.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:37.560]   And all of these rituals that God gave them forced them to be if they obeyed it.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.760]   Keep that in mind.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:48.400]   Chapter 15 described four cases of secretion from the reproductive organs that resulted
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.000]   in ritual uncleanness.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Two of these cases arose from disease and two from natural causes.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.680]   So this is just again another summary of this chapter.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.680]   The first description of the discharge seemed to refer to either diseased flow of semen
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.160]   and many commentators believe that it was a description of maybe gonorrhea, sexually
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:12.640]   transmitted disease, or a discharge of pus from the urethra.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.720]   In either case it was abnormal.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.600]   This was some kind of disease that this person had.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.580]   The second case deals with a non-disease voluntary emission of semen.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.200]   So that can happen through a sexual contact.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.700]   It could happen through masturbation.
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.760]   It could happen through wet dreams.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:38.080]   Whatever it was, was a normal secretion of semen would have been considered unclean.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.720]   That's the second part.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.960]   The third case deals with the woman's menstrual cycle, which was normal.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.000]   Any healthy female would have experienced this monthly.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.860]   So every month, once a week, for seven days, she would have had to have been in isolation.
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.800]   And any bed that she slept on, anything that she touched became unclean.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:02.240]   And one of the things it says is that if a man and a woman is having relations and she
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.240]   happens to start her period, he also becomes unclean for seven days.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.040]   And he also needs to be in isolation.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.280]   But again, you see that in reverse order.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.000]   And then, fourthly, the case involved a woman who experienced continuing menstrual problems
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.620]   beyond her normal period.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.920]   Her purification ritual was the same as the one prescribed for a man with an abnormal
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.160]   discharge.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:33.920]   So we see the case of this in the book of Mark and Luke, right?
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.600]   So Mark chapter 5, and I'll just read this passage.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.880]   And there was a woman who had a discharge of blood for 12 years.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.040]   So again, think about that.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.120]   If she had a discharge of blood that she couldn't stop for 12 years, think about what her life
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.960]   was like.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.560]   Her presence would make other people unclean.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:00.100]   So it may not have been as uncomfortable as leprosy.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:04.360]   She was not forced to live outside the camp, but might as well have because she couldn't
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.360]   be around anybody.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.160]   And this was going on for 12 years.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:12.440]   So she probably hid it as much as she could, right?
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.880]   She had this problem for 12 years and who had suffered much under many physicians and
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.400]   had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.040]   So again, we can understand why she spent every single penny that she had to fix this
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:31.420]   problem because she wouldn't have been able to be around people.
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.480]   She couldn't be in the home.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.660]   Her family couldn't be around her, right?
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.660]   But nothing worked.
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.920]   She had heard the reports of Jesus and came up behind him in a crowd and touched his garment.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:47.320]   So imagine how scandalous that would have been for a woman who was bleeding for 12 years
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.080]   to come and not to be in the presence of that crowd.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:56.140]   So the fact that she was there, anybody who was around her would have become unclean.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:02.680]   So because of her, all of them would have had to at the minimum wash their hands, wash
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:07.560]   their clothes, and then be in isolation for the rest of the day because she came into
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.280]   this crowd, let alone her touching, right?
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.760]   So she comes in, she deliberately comes and touches Jesus' garment.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.560]   She said, "If I touch even his garment, I will be made well."
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:24.080]   So she was desperate that even though this was unlawful for her to do, she did it anyway.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.080]   And immediately the flow of blood dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.300]   of her disease.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.400]   And Jesus perceiving in himself that power that had gone out from him immediately turned
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.960]   about in a crowd and said, "Who touched my garment?"
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.120]   Let me stop right there.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:43.600]   So in every other instance, right, if she touched the other person, what happens to
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.640]   the other person?
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.720]   They become unclean.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.520]   For the first time, she touches Jesus and what happens?
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.680]   She becomes clean.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.800]   She dries up.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.320]   Every other human being, even by touching the table, sitting on the table, and that
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.520]   person coming and sitting at that table will become unclean.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.520]   It was transferable.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.660]   At least the uncleanness was transferable.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:14.160]   Only by touching Jesus was this curse reversed.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.680]   Do you see that anywhere else in the Bible?
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.840]   Yeah, something even more sacred.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.960]   Blood.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   Right?
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:32.200]   One of the most sacrilegious things that they were told not to do is to drink the blood,
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.320]   eat the blood of the animal because the life of the animal is in the blood.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   Right?
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.640]   It was one of the most sacrilegious things.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:44.760]   I mean, you talk about if this made you unclean, drinking blood, right, would have been blasphemous
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.880]   before God.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.560]   But Jesus says in John chapter 6, "If you do not drink of my blood and eat of my flesh,
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.640]   you have no relationship with me."
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.360]   In every other instance, they would have been stoned to death.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.400]   But Jesus says if you drink of me, the curse actually gets reversed.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.560]   Right?
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.760]   So think about this in the context of sin.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.860]   Right?
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:13.880]   In every other instance, our sins bring out the sins of other people.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:19.000]   In every other instance, our defilement defiles other people.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.460]   That's typically what happens.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:25.760]   If you're selfish, you end up, you and I typically trigger the selfishness of other people.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.600]   And that's the curse of mankind.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:35.120]   Because you and I live in a society where under the curse and condemnation of sin, you
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:42.560]   are born a sinner, and then you sin, and your sin causes other people to sin, and we trigger
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.700]   back and forth.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.920]   And this is the state of mankind.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:54.580]   And only in Christ, only in Christ, when we touch him and when we drink of him and eat
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.560]   of him, the curse is reversed.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.340]   And so now, instead of sin being infectious to other people, what happens?
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:08.560]   The love of Christ begins to infect other people, which is the core of the gospel message.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.200]   Do you understand?
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:17.520]   You understand how profound this foundation is to the understanding of the gospel message
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.000]   in the New Testament?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.920]   Because everything about this Levitical system was to teach about the element of what sin
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:32.540]   is doing to mankind and its society, to its family, to its husband, to wife, to children,
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.960]   to generations, to the society, to the nation.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.560]   And all of a sudden, Jesus comes in and he absorbs the sin.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.160]   Instead of reacting to the sin, he draws near, and he who knew no sin became sin.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:51.520]   He absorbs sin, and in his resurrection, he actually reverses the curse.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.840]   Instead of him becoming unclean, we become clean because we touch him, because we eat
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.840]   of him.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.840]   Right?
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:04.060]   I mean, again, as difficult and as hard as Leviticus is, Leviticus is so profound because
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:09.700]   it gives us a deeper understanding of what you and I already confess.
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:15.420]   And again, after he says that, the disciples said to him, "You crowds of press are around
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.620]   you, yet how can you say who touched you?"
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:21.860]   And he looked around to see who had done it, but the woman, knowing what had happened to
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:26.120]   her, came in fear and trembling, fell down before him and told him the whole truth.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.900]   You can understand why she was in fear.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.340]   If the disciples knew what she was doing, she could have easily been stoned.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.220]   And he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well.
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.540]   Go in peace and be healed of your disease."
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:45.380]   So again, the Levitical law gives us a better understanding of that miracle.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:49.860]   Why were these things considered unclean in the first place?
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:54.760]   In Genesis 3, verse 16, the curse of sin reaches into the relationship between a husband and
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:30:00.880]   wife and all sexuality is fallen.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.560]   Sexual perversion is at the core of human rebellion.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:14.240]   So it wasn't just, you know, in our culture we talk a lot about homosexuality because
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:20.960]   it's being pushed as an agenda, but all sexuality has been perverted.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:31.080]   We can't fight homosexuality while watching perverted heterosexual porn because it's both
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.080]   sinful.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:38.280]   Now homosexuality is highlighted in the scripture as being greater sin, but all sexuality, all
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:48.120]   sexuality that you and I experience is perverted because we don't simply have desire for husband
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.320]   and wife.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.520]   So at the fall, sexuality was at the core of human existence, at the core of giving
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.000]   glory to God has been perverted.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.800]   All of it, not just homosexuality.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.540]   Even heterosexuality has been perverted.
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:10.040]   So one of the things that this points to is that human sexuality in and of itself is at
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.140]   the core of human rebellion.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.260]   Remember the context in which this is given?
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:22.020]   This is before they enter into the land of the Canaanites and he told them to be separate.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:27.360]   The Canaanite worship, at the core of it, practiced prostitution and orgies as a regular
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.360]   part of their worship.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:33.820]   And this was not just at this time, but even at the time of Christ when they said, "I don't
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.820]   worship."
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.540]   A good chunk of the idol worship involved orgies and prostitution.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:43.560]   And so we see that clearly being stated in the book of Corinthians, right?
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:48.100]   How they're going to the temples and how a lot of the stuff that Paul mentions there
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:54.140]   are cultural things prohibiting visitation of prostitution because that was a regular
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.300]   part of the Canaanite or the pagan worship.
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:04.700]   So by God making restrictions on these things, automatically prevented Israel to associate
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.520]   with the pagans.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:14.460]   Their dietary laws, their sexuality, all of it automatically would cause them to be set
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.660]   apart.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.780]   None of these discharges made a man or woman sinful, only ceremonially unclean.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:27.140]   He doesn't say that because of the secretion and because you had sex that somehow you became
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.220]   sinful.
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.220]   That's not what it's saying.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:34.580]   It's saying you became ceremonially unclean, ultimately pointing to a specific teaching
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.580]   in the scripture.
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:41.060]   It's not that there was anything inherently wrong with the discharges, but because these
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:46.540]   two are connected with the symbol of life and redemption.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:50.780]   I think I mentioned this either in Bible study or on Sunday sermon.
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:58.100]   I think it was in the Sunday sermon, how what you and I consider to be sacred, right?
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:03.700]   We have so many children being born and new life coming into the world as a source of
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.140]   great joy in a lot of families.
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:13.020]   We would consider if there's anything sacred in our culture, at least from our perspective,
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.980]   is a child being born into this world.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.340]   Because they're innocent, they're pure, at least that's from our perspective.
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:26.260]   But in God's perspective, and in the spiritual reality is, another sinner is coming into
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.340]   the world.
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:34.140]   Until he is atoned by the blood of Christ, he's also another sinner, another human being
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:39.980]   that will rebel against God by his own nature.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:46.100]   As innocent as it may, again, in comparison to us, if we believe in original sin, which
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:52.660]   the Bible clearly teaches, every human being born into this world is another human being
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.740]   that's going to rebel and curse God.
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:34:00.300]   It is not pure, it is not sacred, spiritually speaking.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:06.100]   Now, I want to spend a little bit of time on this passage, Genesis 6, 1-5, because I
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:12.340]   remember doing a paper on this when I was an undergrad Bible major at Biola.
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:16.180]   Who are the Nephilim, who are the sons of God and daughters of man?
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.940]   So much has been written on this subject.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.380]   End conclusion, nobody really knows.
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:27.300]   But I have my own theory, and I want to share my theory with you.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:32.780]   It's not heretical, but to me, it makes the most sense out of all the different things
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.980]   that I've read.
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.900]   In Genesis 6, 1-5, it says, "When man began to multiply on the face of the land, and the
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:44.620]   daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive,
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:48.220]   and they took as their wives any they chose."
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.700]   So let me stop right there.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:53.380]   So the question is, who are the sons of God and who are the daughters of man?
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:59.980]   So some of the theory is the sons of God were specific angels that were sent down to earth,
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.980]   and we don't know who they are, we don't know why they're here, but somehow these celestial
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:10.820]   beings were interacting with human beings, like females, and as a result of that, it
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:17.700]   created this either super race or this race that was in rebellion against God.
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:22.860]   So that's one of the common theories of how they interpret this passage.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.460]   And the Lord said, "My spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh, and his days
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.780]   shall be 120 years."
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:33.180]   So let me give you my theory and how I understand this.
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:38.540]   I think the description "sons of God" and "daughters of man" is just talking about human
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:39.540]   beings.
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:45.420]   You know, in Corinthians it says that the glory of man is God, and the glory of a woman
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:51.320]   is man, and other parts of the Bible it describes women as daughters of man, and then there's
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:56.460]   other parts of the scripture where it just describes men as sons of God, right?
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:02.940]   And so I don't necessarily think that this is in reference to celestial angelic beings.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:09.100]   I think it's just a description of how they were having relations and mankind was multiplying.
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:14.720]   So there wasn't something specifically sinful about this celestial being and this human
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.820]   being getting together and having relations.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:24.740]   I think it's just a description of the multiplication of sinners.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.380]   If you've never read this passage before, you're probably like, "What is he talking
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.380]   about?"
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:32.220]   But if you've ever read this and you've asked this question or you've wrestled with this,
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.020]   you know, hopefully you know what I'm getting at.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:40.940]   I think Genesis chapter 6, 1 through 5 is just a description of mankind just growing
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.160]   in number.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:46.140]   And basically what they're saying is as they were multiplying and filling the land, what
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.340]   does it say?
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.940]   Wickedness was increasing as mankind was increasing.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.100]   And I think that's all it is saying.
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:59.180]   It's not talking about any specific sin of the celestial being and human being.
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:03.100]   It's just man and woman having relations, they're multiplying like crazy and the more
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:08.940]   they multiply, there was more sin, more wickedness.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:13.180]   Now you can challenge me, but that's my theory on this.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.620]   It's not heresy in one way or the other, but to me that makes more sense.
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:20.220]   To me it seems more consistent to what other parts I see.
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:27.740]   Now why I'm bringing this up is because whether this passage is actually saying this or not,
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.940]   that's exactly what's described in scripture.
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.980]   That as man increased, wickedness increases.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:43.460]   You ever wonder why the people out in the farms in the rural areas tend to be nicer?
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:48.860]   Why the people, like anywhere you go, you know, if you go to Beijing, people tend to
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.620]   be a little bit more testy and impatient, but if you go to the countryside, they're
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.300]   a bit more patient.
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.800]   If you go to Seoul, people tend to be testy and more impatient.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.380]   If you go to Jeju-do, the countryside, people tend to be more patient.
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:09.820]   If you go to New York or parts of California, people tend to be more impatient and irritable,
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:16.060]   but if you go to the Midwest, generally tend to be a bit more patient.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:26.140]   My theory is if you're around with a lot of people, you're facing a lot of sin, because
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:32.140]   the more people you're around, there's more selfishness, there's more gossiping, there's
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:38.180]   more reasons to have problems, there's more reasons to be irritated.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:45.780]   So if you look at people who have jobs, whose job is to regularly deal with people, they
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.460]   tend to be more irritable.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.420]   This is my theory.
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:54.220]   That's why the people at DMV are always irritated, because they're dealing with people all day
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.220]   long.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.220]   And that's just my observation.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:59.740]   It's just that anybody who has jobs where they have to deal with people all day long
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:05.700]   tend to be more irritable, and people who tend to just kind of be in isolation, maybe
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.700]   less.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:14.100]   Again, this is just my theory, but I think, again, what I see in scripture is that when
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:18.940]   the Bible talks about everybody getting together and we're going to have peace and all this
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.940]   stuff, I think that's a bad idea.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:28.380]   Because if you gather a lot of sinners together, eventually there's going to be a lot of sin
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.660]   that you have to deal with.
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.140]   True?
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.580]   Okay.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.380]   I bet money that you're going to agree with me one day, right?
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.940]   The more you experience people, the more you will agree with me, I think.
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.180]   That's my guess.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:50.420]   So the increase of people is, all of this points to increase of sin.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:55.740]   And so this particular law, it was a constant reminder to the nation of Israel, wherever
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:59.380]   there's human beings, there's uncleanness.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:06.020]   And there's a lot of human beings, there's greater uncleanness.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.940]   And this is, again, embedded into the culture.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:12.780]   Biblical principle to glean in the New Covenant.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.860]   All things are lawful, but not all things are helpful.
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:21.740]   So this law wasn't telling us that it is sinful, but the clean and unclean pointed to what
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:25.100]   isn't sinful, but still unclean.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:29.660]   Again, I might be milking it here, but in 1 Corinthians 10, 20-24, it says all things
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.860]   are lawful, but not all things are helpful.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.620]   All things are lawful, but not all things build up.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:40.380]   And the one seeks his own good, but the good of his neighbor.
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:46.380]   So it doesn't say that because of these things that you became, you sinned and you needed
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.060]   to do all of these things.
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:55.940]   But there was a constant reminder to the nation of Israel that they were unclean.
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.620]   And there is no way.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:07.500]   If you are at home, even now, if you have a female in your home, seven days out of the
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:12.380]   month, your whole house has to get shut down.
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.060]   It's a constant reminder.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:21.180]   If you have a daughter, and their periods don't line up, it could be two weeks out of
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.380]   the four months, your house has to shut down.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.740]   If you have four, okay, you get my point.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:31.180]   It was a constant reminder that you were unclean.
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:38.180]   It was a constant reminder that uncleanness is not something that you could escape from.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:43.300]   Again, the second principle.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:50.420]   We have corruptible bodies, but we will one day have incorruptible ones.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.660]   What he says in chapter 15 are things that you could not avoid.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:42:00.700]   Every human being was in constant, constantly having to cleanse themselves, wash their hands,
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:04.540]   take a bath, to be ceremonially clean, to be able to approach God.
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:13.020]   Meaning that this law constantly reminded every Israelite that their bodies were corrupted.
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:18.420]   And that's why the Bible talks about that the perishable body will be put on imperishable,
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.900]   mortal body put on immortality.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:23.500]   When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and mortal puts on immortality, then shall
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.740]   come the passing that is written, "Death is swallowed up in victory."
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:33.860]   Until death comes, there will always be impurity in our body.
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:40.020]   And third, finally, bad company corrupts good morals.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:47.700]   So if you read chapter 15, you know how easily this uncleanness was transferred.
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:51.900]   By shaking somebody's hand if you didn't wash your hands, by sitting somewhere where they
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.660]   were sitting, touching something that they touched, it was easily transferable.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:01.740]   And that's why the best thing to do was for them to be in isolation.
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:06.940]   Again, something that mirrors that in the New Testament says bad company ruins good
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:12.540]   morals in 2 Corinthians 6.14, which says not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:16.980]   what partner has righteousness with lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.740]   Again, he's not saying that don't be around non-Christians.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:25.500]   He's talking about unequally being yoked where you're partnering together for something.
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:31.740]   And obviously, the immediate application of that could be dating or being married to an
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.400]   unbeliever.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:49.500]   But the reverse of that, he says in verse 17, "For the unbelieving husband is made holy
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.980]   because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband.
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:56.820]   Otherwise, your children will be unclean, for as it is, they are holy."
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:01.780]   So just as much the scripture warns us about not being unequally yoked, and bad company
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:06.620]   corrupts good morals, the reverse of that is an individual who has been sanctified in
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.940]   the name of Christ, that their presence sanctifies others.
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:13.540]   Now the word sanctify here doesn't mean that that person is saved.
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:19.040]   That there's a heaven and hell, and then there's an intermediary place for people who are married
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   to believers.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.220]   That's not what that's talking about.
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:27.460]   He's talking about common grace, that because of a believing person in that home, that the
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:33.060]   other people in that home are nearer to what purifies them, which is the gospel, which
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.540]   is Christ.
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:40.900]   So if we are aromas of Christ, meaning that if you are an unbeliever or believe in an
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:46.820]   unbelieving home, Paul's telling them do not leave, because your presence sanctifies the
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:51.020]   people in that relationship.
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:57.820]   So the only thing, in every other aspect, if you're unclean, you make them unclean,
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:03.340]   their uncleanness makes you unclean, but the only part, only thing that reverses that is
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:05.700]   the blood of Christ.
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:11.420]   So if we've been touched by the blood of Christ, our presence in this world is to reverse this
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.060]   curse.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:18.980]   Instead of their uncleanness making us unclean, and uncleanness making them unclean, he says
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:26.140]   the blood of Christ that touched us, now we act as an agent of purifying the world.
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.700]   So that's why the Bible describes us as the salt of the earth.
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.940]   We are the light that has come into darkness.
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:37.100]   We are no longer spreading disease.
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:41.540]   If we are the light, we are spreading light into a world that keeps getting darker and
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:46.020]   darker and darker, and that's the principle that we see in this teaching in Leviticus
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.020]   15.
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:55.380]   So the three discussion questions for today, what are some things that would be considered
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:58.460]   lawful or not sinful, but are not helpful or profitable?
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:02.980]   What are some biblical principles that should help us be guided in how to handle these things
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.200]   in Christian life?
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:10.100]   So 1 Corinthians 10, 23-33 is where that phrase comes from, lawful but not profitable.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.340]   So you may look at that as reference.
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.980]   Number two, what are some things that you do or don't do that is a constant reminder
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:22.220]   to you and to the people around you that you are set apart for God, that you're not like
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.220]   the non-Christians?
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:29.580]   Not simply what you say, but what are some things that causes you to stand out at your
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.220]   work?
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:35.500]   Three, what is the greatest thing you've learned from the study of Leviticus?
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:40.100]   This is just kind of in prep for a summary, just so that you have some time for discussion,
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:42.060]   digest, and to apply.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.300]   So up to this point, all the way up to the beginning of chapter one, what are some things
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:50.420]   that caused you to, the greatest thing that you say that you've gleaned from the study
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.820]   of the book of Leviticus, and how did you apply that in your life?
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:53.820]   Okay?
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:47:01.780]   All right, let me pray for us, and then I'll have you guys get into your small groups.
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.580]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you for this evening.
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:12.980]   We thank you, Lord God, that even though this material is difficult to understand, help
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.540]   us, Lord God, to glean from it what you have desired and how you've embedded this into
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:23.220]   the culture and the mindset and the society of your people, the Israelites, and how that
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:26.940]   prepared them to understand the depth of your gospel.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:31.940]   Help us to glean, Father God, what it is that you have given us, and that in view of this
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:37.020]   great mercy that we truly would live appropriate, reasonable lives.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.020]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:38.020]   Amen.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.200]   - We pray, amen.
