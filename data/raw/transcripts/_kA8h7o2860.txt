[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   This hymn, "Great is Thy Faithfulness."
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   [Music]
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   [Music]
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   There is no shadow of turning with thee.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Thou changest not, thy compassions they fail not.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   As thou hast been, thou forever will be.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   All I have needed thy hand hath provided.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Summer and winter and springtime and harvest.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Joined with all nature in manifold witness.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   To thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Great is, great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Morning by morning new mercies I see.

[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   [Music]
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Pardon for sin and a peace that endures.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Blessings all mine with ten thousand these I celebrate.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.

[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Good morning. Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Let me get to our announcements before we get started.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   First of all, today at 2.30 we have a members meeting that's taking place.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Again, at 2.30. It's just enough time for you to go and grab lunch and then be back in this room.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   We're going to start right at 2.30, so try to be here a little bit earlier than that so that we can pray right at 2.30 and get started.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   And the meeting is going to go about an hour, so about 3.30.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   So those of you who have schedules afterwards, so that you can plan accordingly.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   This coming Friday and Saturday we are having our mini Biblical Counseling Conference.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   And so, again, if you haven't signed up, please do so as soon as you can.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   We're going to start Friday, one session, and then there's two sessions on Saturday morning.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   And then we are going to finish with lunch that's going to be provided.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   And then there's going to be some discussions going on during the lunchtime.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   And then so, we should be done around 1 o'clock.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   So those of you who are planning for Saturday, so you'll have some idea.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   And so, if you haven't signed up, please do so as soon as possible.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And because of that, we are not having our regular Bible study.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   We don't have Wednesday Bible study. We don't have home groups this week.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   And nor do we have the Zoom meetings for the home group and the Bible study leaders.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And so, please sign up for that again Friday and then half day Saturday this coming weekend.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Trunk Formation. This is a replacement for Halloween that we do at church.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   The theme of it this year is Sola Fide.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   It happens to be on Sunday, October 31st. And they're asking for about 10 more volunteers to set up for the games and stuff that they will have in their car.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   So those of you who have been here before, you know what we're talking about.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And they said they need about 10 more.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   So if you are able to do so, to volunteer your car, just a simple game or what have you,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   so that the children can kind of walk around and participate in that, please let them know.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And if you want to donate candy or prizes for the children, you can also do that.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   And there is a drop off place in the cafe that you can just drop it off.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   OK, so if you are able to do that, please let Esther Leong know.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   And again, the information is on the app or on the website or maybe on the Facebook.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   So it's going to be from five to seven o'clock.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   So that Sunday they're going to be setting up and then the event's going to last for a couple hours.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   So if you're able to do that, please let them know.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And then one last thing before our Bible study lab.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   So if you are currently in our weekday Bible study and you feel like you need some help
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   in how to do inductive Bible study, you feel lost each week.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   And so this class is really for you on November 7th at 2 p.m. for three sessions.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Pastor Mark is going to go through how to do inductive Bible study.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   So if you are new to the church and you want to jump into the next session
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   that will start mostly sometime in January, this is a class that you want to take
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   because it will help you to be able to do your study for the next session of Bible study.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And even if you're in it and you feel like you'll benefit from this, please sign up for that.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   One last thing, and I'm going to have to keep reminding you.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   On November 7th, we are going to have Orphan Sunday,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   meaning that we're going to be having various ministries that's going to come
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   and represent either foster care and compassion
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   and different ministry that's going to come.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   And so we're going to have a special guest speaker come and speak on that subject.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   And we are planning to take offering because we do have adoption fund that we have at church.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And for the members of the church who are planning to adopt,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   when you're done with the process, there is a scholarship that the church provides.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   And we are going to be taking offering for that.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   So I just wanted to give you a heads up because it's a few weeks away.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And so just to prepare and to pray that you can contribute to that and to encourage other families.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   That even if you're not going to be able to do that,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   you can encourage other families who are praying about that to adopt.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   And then we can come alongside and assist them.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   So that's taking place on November 7th, just to give you a heads up.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And then this morning, after our offering and praise, our brother Colson Wakamoto,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   he's going to come and give his testimony.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   He will be baptized this morning.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   So let me pray for us and we'll give you a minute to give the offering.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   For those of you who brought physical offering, we have an offering box in the back.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   And you can visit that after the service.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Okay? All right, let's pray.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for the privilege that we have to be able to come and worship you.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Help us, Lord God, to truly be Christ-centered in all that we do.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   In our giving and our praising, that all that we do would be an overflow of your mighty grace that you've given us.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   So we pray, Father God, that you would lead us, guide us, that even in our giving,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   may it be done in a way that honors you as an act of worship.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   May it be multiplied, 30, 60, 100 fold, that Christ may be exalted,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   that the world would know, Father God, there is hope in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   We give this offering to you as an act of worship.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   [Music]
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.760]   Good morning, my name is Colson. I'm a junior in the college ministry and this
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:49.920]   is my testimony. I was born in Korea and adopted into a Christ-loving family when
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.000]   I was around six months old. So as I look back, God's plan for my salvation
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.760]   started right off the bat, but I was blind and my heart was too hardened to
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.600]   realize it. I spent my whole life going to church, but the whole time I was just
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.320]   going through the motions. I was even baptized when I was in fifth grade, but I
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:11.320]   was way too young to realize what it truly meant. As I got older, I had all the
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.880]   head knowledge that someone who grew up in the church should have, but it wasn't
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.000]   for the right reasons. I knew all the right answers and what to say during
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.760]   discussions and Bible study, but of course the knowledge I gained was for my
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:25.680]   own self-righteousness, so that I could look like a good Christian to others, but
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.080]   it wasn't for God's glory. I knew about all about God on the surface, but I
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:34.440]   didn't have a personal relationship with him. Because of this, I struggled with
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.360]   surrendering my life fully to Christ and giving up all I have to him. I would
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.360]   still go to church on Sundays and Bible studies on Fridays, but throughout the
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.280]   week I took the mask off and lived as if there was no God. To me, Sundays and
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.760]   Fridays were times to see my friends, not a time to worship Christ. I lived very
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.440]   selfishly regarding my free time, and I wouldn't ever do devotions or read the
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.800]   Bible on my own. Prayer was a rare thing in my life, and I only really prayed when
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.160]   I felt like I needed to. To me, God was like a genie in a bottle. My pride also
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.880]   got in the way, as I felt like I needed to do something in order for me to be
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:12.040]   saved. I never doubted that God existed or thought the Bible was false, but I was
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.920]   much more interested in the empty promises of the world than giving my
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.960]   life to Christ. One of the biggest turning points in my life, and one of the
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.600]   things I am most thankful for, is when God led me to Berean. That's when I truly
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.760]   started to learn about who God really is and what that meant for me. Because of my
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.240]   pride, as I learned about the attributes of God, one of the things I struggled
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.760]   with the most was God's abundant mercy and grace. How could a perfect and holy
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.640]   God love a sinner like me? I always thought that I didn't deserve God's love
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:44.440]   and that there was no way I deserved to be saved. And the funny thing was, I was
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:48.960]   absolutely correct. If God saves me, I have to do or give him something in
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.600]   return, I thought. Again, my pride wouldn't let me get over the fact that there was
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:57.200]   nothing I could do to help even a tiny bit with my salvation. It didn't happen
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:01.400]   overnight, but my mindset started to shift as I realized how broken I was and
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:06.240]   how much I needed God. In return, all I can give back is praise and gratitude.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:11.120]   His love for me has inspired an overflow of worship and adoration, as well as
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:15.040]   longing to learn more about Christ and his word. Experiencing God's love drove
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.160]   me to do daily things that I've never thought about doing before, such as
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:23.120]   spending time in his word and worshiping on my own time. I spent more time praying
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.240]   throughout the day as I felt more natural to go to God, even when I wasn't
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:30.840]   in a dire situation. Doing these things no longer felt like something I had to
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.680]   do, but rather something I was lucky to be able to do, which filled me with joy.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.760]   Over the summer, some of the college ministry did a Bible reading plan of the
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.320]   Old Testament. It was a fast-paced test of obedience, but it really helped me get
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.360]   a better grasp of who our God is. His incredible patience stuck out to me as I
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:51.740]   read about Israel sinning against God time and time again. The God of Israel is
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:56.680]   the same patient God that waited for me to surrender myself and let him in. It
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:00.740]   isn't from the Old Testament, but a verse I find really encouraging is 2 Peter 3
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:05.480]   9. The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some count slowness, but is patient
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.360]   towards you, not wishing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:13.360]   This verse really showed me God's goodness and that he will never give up
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:18.320]   on you, for he doesn't wish for anyone to be subject to his judgment in wrath. I've
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.800]   been rejecting God through my whole life, and he's been waiting for me to let go
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.440]   of the world and completely surrender to him. I've accepted that I'm completely
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:30.880]   undeserving of God's grace, but I rejoice now because I know God and I'm able to
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.960]   have a relationship with him.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:45.960]   [Applause]
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:41:05.960]   [Applause]
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:18.960]   [Applause]
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:24.120]   All right, thank you for your testimony, and we're really looking forward to this
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:31.760]   day because Colson is a friend of my children and a co-worker at Cluck Kitchen.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:36.640]   So I'll give you a pluck to Cluck Kitchen. And so I remember they've been
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:42.480]   trying to, you know, share with him and just through the months and through the
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:47.760]   past just kind of hoping and praying, so I watched that process. And then when I
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.360]   heard that Colson was gonna get baptized, we were all excited. I know the parents
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.920]   are here and the family members here. We're all excited to be able to
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.600]   participate in all of that. Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:10.160]   chapter 13. We're gonna read one verse this morning. Yeah, one verse. And I'm
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.840]   gonna just give you a heads up. There's things that I'm gonna say this morning
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:19.640]   is going to offend some of you. And so this is not going to be one of those
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:26.400]   light-hearted messages, but I wanted to take this time to address certain things
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:30.400]   that are going on in our culture that is important and we wanted to make sure. And
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.800]   I'm sure it's not anything new to you, but I think it is important for us to
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:41.400]   address this going forward and knowing that there is a fight for biblical
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.160]   marriage in our generation that we really need to be aware of and to
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:50.120]   participate in. So let me read this text and then we'll jump in. Verse four.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.720]   Marriage is to be held in honor among all and the marriage bed is to be
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:43:00.680]   undefiled for fornicators and adulterers God will judge. Let's pray.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:07.840]   Heavenly Father, we pray for wisdom. We pray for truth. We pray for love. We pray,
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:13.440]   Father God, for your Holy Spirit to guide us. And I know, Lord, that your Word will
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:18.540]   cut us. It will judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart. But we pray,
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:23.760]   Father God, that as your Word guides and leads us, that ultimately it would bring
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:29.680]   us to true life. Asking for your grace, asking that you would protect our church,
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:34.840]   this generation, Lord God, that we may be the light that you've called us to be. So
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:42.080]   we pray for your Spirit's guidance. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. I think you will all
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:53.360]   agree that some of your best memories from your childhood will probably be
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:59.840]   from your family, interaction with your parents, with your siblings, families get
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:03.640]   together with uncles and aunts and grandparents, and so you have a lot of
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:09.120]   great memories of that when you're young. But also some of your most painful
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:14.560]   memories also come from your childhood because maybe your parents didn't have
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:19.640]   the godliest marriage or maybe, you know, a lot of you came from broken families.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.880]   And even if they didn't, weren't broken, they didn't have the healthiest, godliest
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:29.360]   of marriages, so you have very painful memories from that. And this is obviously,
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:33.360]   this is not unique to the church, people who are in the church. We live in a
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:38.520]   generation where supposedly more than 60% of marriages end in divorce, so
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.960]   there's a lot of pain that people are living through and baggages that they
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:48.200]   have, and so part of the reason why there's the counseling, psychological
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:52.160]   counseling has kind of taken off is because so many people are in pain and
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:45:00.520]   as a result of that. They did a study and they said that 50% of people believe that
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:06.440]   marriage isn't that important to the health of society. 50%. Two-thirds of
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:12.280]   people who are in the age of 19 to 29 believe it's not even necessary. Since it
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:17.360]   causes so much pain, why do we even need to do that? Only 36% of the people
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:23.480]   believe that marriage is even necessary. So more and more people in our
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:27.560]   generation are coming to their own conclusion that if it's going to cause
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:32.160]   this much pain, why have it? And you see celebrities coming out and openly saying
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:37.920]   that it is a dead institution. It is a construct of society that no longer
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.640]   works. So, equal habit, if it doesn't work, move on, find somebody else, and that's
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:50.080]   kind of like the culture that has been readily accepted. There is nothing to me
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:57.760]   that is as clearly, that causes the church to be separated and defined and
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:04.360]   different than the biblical teaching of marriage and sexuality. If there's any
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:10.520]   one thing that the world will look at and say, "Wow, those people are weird." At
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:16.680]   least in our generation, it's this human sexuality and the biblical
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:23.800]   definition of what a marriage ought to be. Especially now. If you haven't noticed
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:28.760]   it, I'm pretty sure it is coming. That because if we are to remain faithful to
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:35.240]   what the Bible says, what marriage is and what human sexuality ought to be, that
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:41.600]   persecution is already here and it's only going to intensify. Because this one
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:47.440]   thing is going to separate us clearly in the eyes of the world. And all the
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:53.560]   more why we need to make sure that what the scripture says, that we do not
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:47:00.280]   compromise, no matter what consequences may come. We're not here to appease the
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.480]   world, we're not here to make sure that that the people in the world feel
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:07.000]   comfortable here, we're here to exalt Christ. And so we need to make sure that
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.760]   what Christ says is what is being taught in scripture in the church. So this
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:16.160]   morning there's two parts of this sermon. The first part is, it says in verse 4,
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:20.080]   it says, "Marriage is to be held in honor among all." What does that mean? What does
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.960]   it mean to honor marriage and why is this so important? And then secondly, it
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.000]   says, "Marriage bed is to be undefiled. For foreign occasions and adulterous, God
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.080]   will judge." What is the application of that? Practically, how do we honor
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:40.400]   marriage in a practical way? So first of all, marriage is to be held in honor
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:45.520]   among all. So let me start out by saying among all is not just talking about
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:50.360]   those who are married, those who are of age. Among all includes everybody, young
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:56.120]   and old. That you and I need to understand that all human relationships
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:00.880]   stem from the marriage between husband and wife. So there is no relationship
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.880]   between father and son or daughter, brother, sister, grandparents, uncle. All
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:11.280]   human relationship started by the relationship between Adam and Eve. So if
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:15.240]   the relationship between Adam and Eve is not honored, everything else that comes
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:20.800]   from that is also going to be distorted. You cannot fix the human relationship
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:25.480]   until we fix the relationship between husband and wife. And so when it says to
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:29.440]   honor marriage by all, this is not just for those people who are married. This is
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:34.760]   something that married or not, young and old, single or not, that we need to
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.800]   recognize what the scripture teaches about this subject. The word for honor is
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:44.480]   the same word it describes the precious stone in 1st Corinthians 3.12. In 1st
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   Peter 1.19, that word for honor is translated precious as the blood of
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:56.360]   Christ. 2nd Peter 1.4, it says the promises of God is also precious and to
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:02.740]   be honored. It means that we recognize the value of what this is. Why is this so
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:07.160]   precious? Why is that word that describes the blood of Christ, the
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:13.120]   church of Christ, the promise of God, and that we ought to honor the marriage in
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.880]   that light? First of all, the Bible makes it very clear. Marriage is not a social
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:24.880]   construct. It was created by God. Okay, let me say that again. Marriage is not a
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:29.720]   social contract that we are to say, "It doesn't work because it's broken that
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:33.680]   we're not going to do this anymore." It was God-ordained. When was it ordained?
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:39.880]   From the get-go. In Matthew 19, 3 to 6, there's some Pharisees who came to Jesus
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:43.920]   testing him and asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:48.120]   at all?" And he answered and said, "Have you not read that He who created them
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:55.040]   from the beginning made them male and female?" From the beginning. It wasn't
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:58.600]   hundreds of years later. It wasn't thousands of years later. He said, "From
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:02.320]   the beginning when He created them male and female, He said, 'For this reason man
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.760]   shall leave his father and mother to be joined to his wife and the two shall
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:10.520]   become one flesh.'" So they are no longer two but one flesh. "What therefore God has
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:15.600]   joined together, let no man separate." So in every wedding ceremony you will hear
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:21.440]   at the declaration of your covenant union what God has put together, "Let no
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:28.480]   man separate." So the first reason why we honor marriage is God created this, God
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:33.720]   ordained this from the beginning. From the get-go. And every other human
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:37.600]   relationship. He didn't create Adam and Eve and then uncles and then children
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:43.560]   and all at once. He created man and female. All of the relationships came
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:48.960]   from these two people, from this marriage. Genesis 2 18 says, "Then the Lord God
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:53.440]   said, 'It is not good for man to be alone. I will make him a helper suitable for
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:58.820]   him.'" So this text specifically is the purpose of why He created Adam and the
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:03.980]   purpose of why He created Eve. He created all other creation and then He
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:09.020]   ends up by saying, "It is good." And then He creates Adam and He said, "It is not good
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:12.560]   for him to be alone." So we have to understand that when He says it is not
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:17.540]   good, He's not talking about morally not good. The word good here can also be
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:23.500]   understood not complete. God created him and it was not good because what God had
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:29.420]   ordained him to be is not complete. Because God's call for Adam was to
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:35.060]   remember twofold. To be fruitful and multiply, right? And then to subdue the
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:40.660]   land. To be the ruler of the land. Those are the two creation mandates. But in
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:47.060]   order to do that, He had to create Eve. And so He says, "I will make him a helper
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:51.540]   suitable for him." Suitable. You know, it's interesting the word suitable means
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:57.220]   someone who is opposite or corresponding. Someone who will complement. You know, it's
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:03.300]   interesting because just by observation, most people who end up being attracted
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:08.060]   to one another are usually opposites. And I'm not saying that's 100%. Right? You
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:12.180]   may be sitting next to your husband and wife and my guess is 90% of you, your
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:18.460]   wife is a bit different. Right? So if you happen to be very quiet, your wife may be
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:23.820]   extra. Maybe you're the extra and then your wife is a quiet one. And I'm not
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:28.020]   saying that that's true of every relationship. I'm saying it just for the
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:32.820]   most part, when we say opposites attract, that's probably describes most
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:37.980]   people. Not 100%, nothing is ever 100%. What's interesting is the way he
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:43.780]   describes Eve is that she would be the corresponding partner. A complement. Not a
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:48.180]   supplement. Not the same person, but somebody who's going to complement. And
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:53.100]   so he made Eve to be a couple, even physically, so that they would physically
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:58.780]   fit each other. So that what he cannot do, that he needs her to be able to do that.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:04.020]   Both physically and spiritually. But here's the problem. That was God's
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:09.340]   ordination. He created Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply. He needed Eve to do
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:13.860]   that and to subdue the land. So he was, if you look before the fall, they're
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:18.380]   laboring together. They're naming animals and they're working. But you know what
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:23.140]   happens. Sin comes in. They rebel against God and the first thing that happens is
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:27.580]   Genesis 3, 7. Then the eyes of both of them were open and they knew that they
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:33.900]   were naked. Right? Now, even if you're naked, it doesn't bother you if you're by
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:39.940]   yourself. Right? Why were they hiding? And they sewed fig leaves together and made
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:44.940]   themselves loin covering. So who were they covering themselves so that to hide
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:51.580]   their nakedness from? Each other. It wasn't like, "Ew, disgusting." There's no mirrors back
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:56.860]   then. Right? They recognized their nakedness and they hid from each other.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:03.700]   So from the get-go, there was shame. And so this husband and wife relationship,
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:08.220]   they hid from each other. See, one of the most key things that we cover in
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:12.220]   marriage counseling is biblical communication because nobody is
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:17.940]   completely, 100% honest. And it shows in the way that we communicate because
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:23.660]   before I say anything to you, I calculate in my head, "If I say this, what are you
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:29.100]   gonna think? How will you respond? What will you think of me if you say this? Or
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:32.460]   maybe you said something that hurt me, so now I'm gonna say this to hurt you." So
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:36.780]   everything that comes out of my mouth comes through some kind of filter. So
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:41.380]   nobody is ever completely honest. And where this first comes in is a
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:44.340]   relationship between husband and wife. That's what it says. They hid from each
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:53.180]   other. So from the get-go, the marriage relationship was tainted. Genesis 3.16.
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:55:00.300]   He says, "Because of the sin, the curse on Eve was, 'I will greatly multiply your
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:07.620]   pain in childbirth.'" Remember, this was the reason why Eve was created, so that she
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:11.240]   could be a suitable helper, so that they can be fruitful and multiply. But here it
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:17.660]   says, "You will be fruitful and multiply, but it will be painful." And pain and
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:21.220]   childbearing is not just referring to the actual birth itself. It's talking
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:25.980]   about the whole process of giving birth, raising children. And again, those of you
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:30.260]   who've raised children, you know, right, the hardest thing that you do in life is
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:37.020]   to raise a sinner, right? And we pray for salvation because it's really for our own
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:45.440]   benefit. Because it's hard raising a sinner, right? Even after they're saved. In pain, you
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:49.180]   will bring forth children, and then yet your desire will be for your husband, and
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:52.820]   he will rule over you. You notice that? She was there. She was created to be a
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:57.500]   suitable helper, to be fruitful, multiply. She was there to help him, but instead
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:01.500]   there's contention in this relationship. Desire will be for your husband. And the
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:07.420]   word desire here is a kind of word where she's trying to challenge him,
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:13.060]   and he said, "But he's going to rule over you." Instead of being a complement, they
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:21.460]   became the adversary because of sin. So she's still carrying out the creation
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:25.940]   mandate, but as soon as sin comes in, the very thing that they call them to do, it
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:31.900]   becomes contentious in the home. Genesis 3, 17 to 19, "Cursed is the ground because
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:36.340]   of you," and this is the curse to Adam, "in toil you will eat of it all the days of
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:40.540]   your life." Remember, he was called, he was created to take care of the land. He said,
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:44.380]   "You're going to take care of it, but you will eat of it in toil. Both thorns and
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:47.740]   thistles it shall grow for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. By the
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:54.580]   sweat of your face you will eat bread." The curse of the fall is not our job,
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:59.380]   because God gave him a job before that sin came in. But what happened was your
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:03.500]   job became painful, and it produced thorns and thistles, "Till you return to
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:07.100]   the ground, because from it you are taken, for you are dust, and to dust you shall
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:16.140]   return." What God created was good. Sin came in and tainted everything, and it
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:20.820]   started with the relationship between husband and wife. There's a reason why in
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:25.700]   our generation, in order to attack the work of God, the first place where it
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:30.020]   attacks is the family, because if the family falls apart, then the relationship
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:33.540]   with husband and wife, then the children fall apart, and if that falls apart, then
[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:37.500]   the relationship between siblings fall apart, and if that falls apart, then all
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:42.060]   the other relationships that is, that hinges on this relationship, also begins
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:49.700]   to unravel. So when he says to honor the marriage bed, and to honor, honor marriage
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:55.020]   itself, it really is at the core of the reversal of this curse, because curse
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:58:02.380]   first came in, in the marriage. That's why in Ephesians chapter 5, 22 to 32, you know
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:06.340]   the passage where it says, "Wife, be subject to your own husband as to the Lord, for the
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:09.580]   husband is the head of the wife, and as Christ also is the head of the church, he
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:12.700]   himself being the Savior of the body," and he says, "submit to your husband as a
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:18.220]   church does to Christ," and then in 25 to 28, it says, "to the husbands, to love them
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:23.740]   sacrificially, as Christ gave himself for the church." When he says gave himself,
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:30.180]   he's not simply saying he prioritized her, he's saying he died, and so what he's
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:35.180]   calling the husband to do, is to sacrifice who he is for the sake of his
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:42.020]   wife. You'll hear this sermons about this at weddings, you know, and anniversaries,
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:46.460]   because it's a beautiful passage about the biblical mandate of marriage, but
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:50.380]   here's how he sums it up in verse 31, "For this reason a man shall leave his father
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:53.860]   and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh,
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:58.420]   but this mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:04.740]   church." So he says that this illustration is that Christ and what he
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:08.340]   did for the church is not to uphold the marriage, but the marriage is to uphold
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:14.780]   the gospel, because where the curse came in, and the ramification of the curse
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:19.820]   came in between husband and wife, the reversal of the curse is going to also
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:25.700]   begin at husband and wife, and that's the reason why that one of the
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:30.780]   qualifications of elders that's repeated in every list, is that he needs to be
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:35.020]   able to manage household well, that this man needs to, there needs to be evidence
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:40.300]   that there is regeneration in his life first at home, between husband and wife,
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:47.260]   and with their children, so that once there is evidence of genuine salvation,
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:53.060]   reconciliation with God at home, then that man could be a leader at church. So
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:57.480]   the proving ground where regeneration, reconciliation happens first is at home.
[00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:05.980]   Is he a leader at home, and if so, then can he lead at church? Marriage is the
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:14.640]   epicenter of the enemy's attack. It has always been, but especially now. Marriage
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:19.900]   is where the greatest sanctification takes place. Now, if before you're
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:23.640]   married, you can kind of stiff-arm some people. I mean, you shouldn't do that, but
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:27.620]   you know, everybody practices that, "That person, I like him." You know, "We're gonna be
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.840]   acquaintances, we're gonna be best friends, you're the person I'm gonna
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:36.280]   tolerate." And so there's a lot of sinfulness in us and selfishness in us
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.080]   that we kind of pick and choose who we're comfortable with. When you get
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.860]   married, right, and you say, "Well, you know, we got to know our wife, and we got to know our
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:48.760]   husband." Yes, that's true, but every, no matter how well you know your husband and
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:54.600]   wife, there are hidden sins in everybody that you're not gonna see until you get
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:01:00.880]   married. There's selfishness that we hide. Of course we hide it, right? You know, we
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.140]   come out, when we go date, I mean, if that guy comes out with, you know, ripped
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:08.800]   jeans, and he just doesn't care, like, right off the bat, don't give him a
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:15.320]   chance, right? This was not important to him, right? At first date, if he doesn't
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.480]   put out his best foot, he doesn't put his best shirt and best pants and come out,
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:26.320]   already that tells you something, just, "Eh!" Move on, right? But we do the
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.560]   same thing when we first get married, because we want to give our best, and so,
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.000]   you know, if you have a bad temper, you hold it. If you're selfish, you know,
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   you're very generous, right? Sooner or later, our fallen nature is going to be
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.600]   exposed. But when you're married, a married couple, you can't go anywhere, right?
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:49.280]   When you're dating, you get mad, and you go to your corner, and you cool off
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:54.560]   after, you know, maybe a few days, and then now you're back to your, the person that
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.120]   you want to present, and you bring them back, but when you're married, you don't
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:06.120]   have that opportunity. So, God uses that to sanctify us, because as they, as you
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:12.240]   see their sins, your sins are going to be exposed, right? Our sins get exposed by
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:16.800]   other people's sin. So, when you see their sins, you're going to respond in a
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.480]   sinful way, and when your sin gets exposed, like, we are to be sanctified. And
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:26.040]   so, marriage is a place, because it's the most intimate relationship we have that
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:30.800]   we cannot hide from one another, God uses that to sanctify us. So, it is the
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:35.080]   greatest place of sanctification. Marriage is where the greatest practice
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:40.040]   of agape love is to be practiced. There's a reason why he says to love your
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.300]   neighbor, because neighbor is the person closest to you, and there's nobody
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:48.000]   closest to us than our husband and wives. And so, we are to practice that
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.120]   unconditional sacrificial love, even when they don't deserve it, especially when
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:56.120]   they don't deserve it. We are to practice the love that he
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:01.280]   practiced in us. So, where the rubber meets the road in the practice of this
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:07.320]   love is in marriage. It is the proving ground for leadership in the church,
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.520]   which I've already mentioned, and then, fourthly, it is where the future
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:15.160]   generation comes from. So, if you want to attack the church, and you want to make
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:19.080]   sure that it ends in this generation, ruin the family, and then the next
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:24.600]   generation, it would be it. So, there's a reason why our enemy, who prowls around
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:31.700]   like a roaring lion, when he is wanting to attack, where he's going to
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:36.480]   attack first is the home between husband and wife. And so, if you bring defilement
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:42.320]   into that, all the other relationships are going to unravel. And so, this is why
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:47.800]   this is so important, and this is why I'm taking this morning to cover this issue,
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:54.520]   because we need to recognize what we're up against. We need to make sure that our
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:59.920]   idea of what is right and wrong, what is good and bad, is not coming from the
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:04.560]   culture. That it's not coming from what is popular in our
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:10.680]   generation. First of all, how do we do this? He says, "By keeping the marriage
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:17.660]   bed undefiled." And he's talking about sexual purity. Undefiled. You know, the
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:25.280]   term sex has become a dirty word, right? So, if I say sex, my guess is, automatically,
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:35.880]   there's a little bit of discomfort. Sex. Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex. Just in case nobody
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:44.320]   heard it. Sex. Sex. Anybody sleeping? Sex. Okay, so.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:53.360]   This is good for him. Let him pay attention. Okay. You know, first service, we
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:59.760]   had small children all over the place, and parents were squirming. But the term
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:06.120]   sex, in and of itself, is not a dirty word. It's not a dirty word. God gifted that to
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:10.800]   Adam and Eve. He said to be fruitful and multiply. He created Eve, and so how were
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.000]   they going to obey this biblical mandate? Through sex, between husband and wife.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.440]   But the reason why the term makes us feel uncomfortable is because almost
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:24.680]   everyone in this room, when we think of sex, we think of the perversion that is
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:34.920]   outside of what God intended. Let me give you an example. I got water here.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:42.240]   Drinking water. I need it, right? Now, you can't live without water. And I got some
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:49.760]   dirt. And I got this from this plant underneath here, right? Now, in and of
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:54.560]   itself, it's great. In fact, you know, you need, in order for this plant to survive,
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:06:02.080]   it needs the dirt that God created. It needs the water that God created. That
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:08.720]   was, I was just thirsty. In and of itself, like, it needs it, and if I pour both of
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:13.200]   it into the pot, what does it do? It causes the plant to grow. It produces
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:17.920]   life. But in the moment that I take it out of its ordained place and I pour it in
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:27.080]   here, I can't drink it anymore. It's useless. See, the problem is not sex.
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:34.560]   God created sex to produce life when it is practiced in the ordained manner that
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:39.240]   God has given as a gift to husband and wife. But when you take it out of the
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:50.000]   context, it is useless. Now I can't drink it. I got to pour it back in here. Because sex was for the
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:58.240]   purpose, again, and there's a reason why God made it enjoyable. It's not dirty. He
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:06.160]   made it so that you would enjoy it in obeying God's creation mandate. But the
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:11.960]   problem is that we've all been introduced to the defiled idea of sex
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:18.040]   in this world. And so what ends up happening is, when we think of sex, we're
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:21.800]   not thinking about the biblical gift of sex. We're thinking about the perversion
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:29.040]   that you and I all have been introduced to. Francis Schaeffer says that people
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:33.720]   drift along from generation to generation and the morally unthinkable
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:38.560]   becomes unthinkable as the years move on. Let me say that again. People drift along
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.120]   from generation to generation and the morally unthinkable becomes thinkable as
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.320]   the years move on. Some of you who are younger may not have the benefit of
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:51.200]   knowing what it was like 30 years ago or 40 years ago. But those of you who are a
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:58.120]   bit older, you know exactly what he means by that. What was unthinkable, even in the
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:03.600]   non-Christian world, has become not only thinkable but openly practiced.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:10.200]   And sad to say, it is starting to penetrate even inside the church. What is
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:16.200]   unthinkable has become thinkable and actually is being practiced. You know
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.880]   what's interesting is, here the word fornicator, and then there's another word
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.080]   for adultery, says they will be judged. And the specific nuance of this word
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:28.320]   fornicator is pornos, where we get the word pornography. And that word basically
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:34.120]   means to sell, to sell cheaply. And so that word was used specifically for male
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:39.120]   prostitutes. But the idea of this word is to take something that is
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:44.720]   valuable and cheapen it. That you know, you see the certain shows, you know,
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.640]   antique roadshow, and then you'll see somebody who picked up this painting for
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:53.360]   $15 and then they go and get it, you know, assessed. And they say, oh this was from
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.880]   Monet that they lost so many years ago. It's worth $15 million. But they, he
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:04.280]   found it at a garage sale. Because owner had no idea of its value. That's that
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:11.960]   word. Pornos. Pornos. Is to take something that is so valuable and to cheapen it.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.880]   Because we don't understand the value of what it is that God has given us. The
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:21.800]   word adultery basically means to live by your flesh. Just to give in to your
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:32.000]   impulse, to instinct. You know, we could think, humanly speaking, when we commit
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.320]   sexual sin, it doesn't hurt anybody. When we slander people, we hurt them.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.680]   When we steal, when we, you know, when we do these things, we actually hurt people. But
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:44.200]   you know, if we're, if we are impure and we're hooked on pornography, watch things
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.720]   that we shouldn't watch, right, it doesn't hurt anybody. Because it's just me being,
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:54.760]   doing it privately. But here's what it says. In 1st Corinthians 6, 18 to 20, it
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:59.040]   says, flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body,
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:06.720]   but the immoral man sins against his own body. I've said this before. It is
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:12.120]   ridiculous that some people of prominence are saying that God screams
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:16.000]   social justice, but he whispers sexual immorality. Look at what he says. All
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.080]   other sins commits outside of the body. He's, he is separating the sexual immorality
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:27.680]   with all other sins. But the immoral man sins against his own body. So the
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:32.640]   scripture screams sexual immorality. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:37.800]   Look at the scripture. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:42.360]   Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own, for
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:47.920]   you have been bought with the price, therefore glorify God in your body. What
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:57.000]   is the most precious thing in this building? Guitar? The synthesizer? Is that
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:04.320]   outdated term? Keyboard? The drums? Our AV system? What's the most precious thing in
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:11.800]   this building? It's you. It's me. Because the Bible says that we've been purchased
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.480]   by the blood of Christ. That may cost two, three thousand dollars. I don't know how
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.560]   much it costs. The drum, a couple thousand dollars. Maybe ten, fifteen thousand
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.880]   dollars for the AV system. But every child of God was purchased by the
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:28.440]   precious blood of Jesus Christ. The Son of God had to come and give himself to
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:33.760]   purchase us. And the Bible says that we no longer belong to ourself. This is his.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.760]   And so when we think that we're not hurting anybody, the greatest crime, the
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:46.000]   greatest sin, is to defile what God had declared to be holy. He didn't just say
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.960]   we were holy. He died on the cross and shed his blood, absorbed our sins to make
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:59.160]   us holy. So to think that somehow the sexual sin only bothers us is because we
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:05.960]   don't understand what it is that we have in Christ. To keep this marriage bed
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:13.960]   undefiled begins before we get married. And even after we get married. What we do even by
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:19.680]   ourselves. Saving ourselves for marriage. You know what's interesting about this
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.600]   word marriage? It's not just in reference to two people who are married. The
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:28.160]   marriage of institution. The specific nuance of this word is the marriage
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:34.720]   ceremony. It's the day that you get married. He's saying that do not defile the
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:39.240]   marriage ceremony. Meaning when you come together, that you come together prepared,
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:47.960]   undefiled. The way that dating happens in our generation is completely pagan.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:55.160]   Let me say this again. If you follow the pattern of this world and you date like
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:01.800]   everybody else dates in our generation, it is completely pagan. We're Bereans
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:05.680]   because we want to examine the Word of God that everything that we do that
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:12.680]   we're following what the scripture tells us to do. When it comes to this, we have a
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:18.560]   tendency to have no intention to buy the car but you're in the car, you're
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.600]   decorating the car, you're cleaning the car, you're investing, change the tires and they
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:27.040]   say, "Are you gonna buy the car?" I said, "No, not yet." So you start the engine, you put it
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.400]   on drive and then you put one foot on the brake and then the other foot
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.680]   revving it up as hard as you can. "Are you gonna drive the car?" I said, "No, not yet."
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:42.120]   And that's kind of how we date. That we act like we're married and then
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:46.140]   when we get physically intimate, it's like, "Oh, we made a mistake." But everything
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:51.560]   that you did led to that. It says in Psalm 8, 4, "I want you to swear, O daughter of
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:57.680]   Jerusalem, do not arouse or waken my love until she pleases." What he means by
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:02.320]   that is that not to arouse. Don't do things to arouse this passion
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:08.120]   until it's time. What's the time he's referring to? The marriage. So that night
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:13.040]   when the husband and wife comes together, it was meant for that. He says, "Do not
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.440]   defile the marriage bed. Keep it holy, undefiled, until God ordains it." So when
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:22.480]   two people come together for the purpose of marrying, we're not there to celebrate
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.280]   the love of these two people even though that's what brought them there.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:31.440]   Ultimately we come to the Christian wedding, is coming to the altar and
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:37.400]   asking God to bless this covenant. That's why every once in a while, it's like, "I'll go to
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:42.960]   Vegas and let Elvis Presley, you know, ordain our marriage." You could do that
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.800]   legally and the world will acknowledge you, but that's not a Christian wedding.
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:51.920]   You can go to a courtroom and then the court was some, you know, some clerk
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:56.080]   just signs the paper off and says, "Yes, legally in the world you're married." But that's
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.880]   not a Christian marriage. Christian marriage is coming before the Lord and
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:05.840]   asking the Lord to bless this covenant. And so when a pastor says whatever
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:12.640]   God has put together, let no man separate. God puts it. So if we want
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:17.080]   God's ordination, we don't come with a paper that the world signs and say, "Hey,
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.280]   the world says I'm married, so I need you to acknowledge this." No, every
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.800]   time two Christians come together at the altar, that's where the wedding takes
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:30.040]   place. That's where the union takes place. And so he's saying, "Do not arouse or
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:38.560]   awaken my love until she pleases." I want to read this song from this great
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:47.760]   theologian, Beyonce, of our generation. Put a ring on it. I didn't realize
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.760]   that this was a song for sacredness of marriage until I read the lyrics.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.640]   You guys all seen the dances on YouTube and stuff, but here are the
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:04.560]   lyrics. "All the single ladies..." I'm not gonna sing it. I'm not gonna ruin
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.360]   the whole message because of this. "All the single ladies, all the single ladies,
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:13.400]   all the single ladies, all the single ladies, now put your hands up. Up in the club. We
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:18.440]   just broke up. I'm doing my own thing. Decided to dip and now you want a trip
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:26.040]   because another brother noticed me. I'm up on him, he up on me. Don't pay him any
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:31.800]   attention. Just cried my tears for three good years. You can't be mad at me.
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:36.880]   Because if you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it. If you liked it,
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:40.600]   then you should have put a ring on it. Don't be mad once you see that he want it.
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:46.720]   If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it. Oh, oh, oh."
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:56.600]   There's two parts of two deep theological truths in this song.
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:08.640]   One is, if you wanted her, you should have put a ring on it. If you want to possess
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:14.440]   her, if you want to have her, marry her. That's what he's saying. That's what she's
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:21.440]   saying, right? So, sacredness of marriage. The other side of it is, if you've
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:27.280]   already given yourself to him, why does he need to put a ring on it? If everything
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.520]   that was reserved for marriage was given to him outside of marriage, why does he
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:35.720]   need to get married then? So, this song really is about the sanctity of marriage.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:42.840]   Because that's what marriage was created for. When it says, "Do not arouse
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:51.960]   until it is time," meaning that we ought to stay pure until we are married.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:58.520]   Thirdly, we need to uphold the marriage, honor the marriage, by upholding biblical
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:09.800]   marriage between man and woman. You know, it's disturbing because 30-some years ago,
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.640]   when I started preaching, I would go to a church, and it doesn't matter what church
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.280]   I am, I could talk about homosexuality being against the scripture, and I would
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:25.480]   almost get an over...of course. Even at school, even at a secular setting, I would
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:30.440]   rarely get any kind of pushback. Now, sometimes, even when I'm at a Bible
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.760]   church, I would say something like this, and somebody would come up to me and
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:41.600]   say, "How can you possibly say this?" Let me make this absolutely crystal clear.
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:47.640]   The Bible is not ambiguous about the subject. It is not ambiguous about the subject.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:52.080]   Genesis 127, it says, "God created man in his own image. In the image of God, he
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:58.080]   created him. Male and female, he created them." More and more people in our culture
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:06.240]   are saying, "Male doesn't mean male. Female doesn't mean female." And so, more and more
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:11.080]   people who are sympathetic, I understand, and I know that you have people in this
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:16.520]   room, you could be struggling, maybe with same-sex attraction, maybe you have
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:20.360]   brother or sister or cousin or somebody that you know, you're really struggling
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:25.880]   with this, and because of your sympathetic heart, you want this not
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:33.040]   to be true. I understand your heart. You cannot compromise what the Word of God
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:37.480]   clearly says. The Bible has not been written so that you need to go to
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:43.280]   school, and you need to learn deep theology, and then to come out, it says,
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:50.960]   "Male doesn't mean male, and female doesn't mean female." The Bible was
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:57.200]   written so that a child who reads it comes out and says, "Male and female." And more and
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:01.760]   more people are coming out and saying, "No, no, no. Gender cannot be identified by human
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:06.400]   parts. It's happening what's inside." So male isn't male, female isn't female.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:10.640]   Leviticus 18, 22 says, "You should not lie with a male as one lies with a female.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:15.960]   It is an abomination." It is an abomination because it challenges God's
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:20.560]   purpose in creation. The very reason why you and I were created is to be fruitful
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:26.040]   and multiply. So if Satan's going to attack, he attacks that. Once you attack
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:33.880]   that, you cannot obey the biblical mandate. Romans chapter 1, 26 to 27, "For
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:37.080]   this reason God gave them over to degrading passions. For their woman
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:42.080]   exchanged a natural function for what is unnatural. And in the same way also men
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:45.600]   abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.160]   one another. Men with men committing indecent acts and receiving their own
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:59.240]   persons the due penalty of their error." This push to erase gender identity is
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:07.520]   not new. From the beginning when Satan decided to challenge God, he began to
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:15.560]   attack the marriage. What's happening now is not new. It just happens to be more
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:18.840]   prominent and because we have media it's being spoken of and and there's
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:23.680]   pressure coming and for sure persecution is coming because of this.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:29.800]   Bible is not ambiguous. 1 Corinthians 6, 9 through 10, "Do you not know that the
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:33.800]   unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:40.200]   fornicators, adulterers, nor idolaters, adulterers, nor effeminate or homosexuals."
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:47.320]   You know the word effeminate basically means a man who acts like a female.
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:53.160]   Specifically is referring to male prostitutes. But an individual who has
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:58.360]   feminized himself to act like a female. That's what that specific understanding
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:03.600]   of that word means. "Nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkard, nor
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:09.800]   revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God." The Bible is clear. So I
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:15.400]   ask you and some of you may have been challenged by your friends and said
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:21.160]   that's not what the Bible says. And so I encourage you to be Bereans. If what I
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:26.240]   say disturbs you, don't say I don't like that guy. That guy, that guy's like this.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.560]   Test the scriptures. Go to the Bible. Look at the verses that are being quoted and
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:36.880]   look at it for yourself. See if this is the prejudice of this guy or a few
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:46.360]   right-wing Christians or does the Bible actually teach this? I'm telling you
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:54.680]   emphatically there is no ambiguity in this issue. It is crystal clear. Marriage,
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:23:01.840]   fourthly, must be between two believers. In 2nd Corinthians 6, 14 through 16, "Do
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.920]   not be bound together with an unbeliever for what partnership have righteousness
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:10.160]   and lawlessness? What fellowship has light with darkness? Or what harmony has
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:14.800]   Christ with Belial? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:19.560]   What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:23.840]   living God, just as God said, 'I will dwell in them and walk among them and I will be
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:30.960]   their God and they shall be my people.'" Evangelism, mission marriage or mission
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:38.440]   dating is not biblical. Again, the Bible is clear on that. How can one person who
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:43.760]   believes that his whole hope rests upon Christ and his sacrifice and an
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:50.320]   individual who doesn't even believe in God raise children together? They cannot.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:56.280]   Either the person has completely compromised their faith or they probably
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:03.240]   don't believe at all. But the Bible is crystal clear on this subject. A biblical
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:09.320]   marriage is between two believers. Fifthly, marriage covenant is never to be
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:14.040]   broken outside of what God permits. And again, at the end of the marriage we say
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:19.080]   what God has put together, let no man separate. In Malachi 2, 16, it says, "For I
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:25.080]   hate divorce," says the Lord the God of Israel. "And him who covers his garments
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.840]   with wrongs," says the Lord of Hosts, "so take heed to your spirit that you do not
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:34.160]   deal treacherously." I hate divorce. I mean, there's no ambiguity there. God makes
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:39.800]   that absolutely crystal clear. In Matthew 19, 9 it says, "And I say to you, whoever
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:44.040]   divorces his wife except for immorality and marries another woman commits
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:50.920]   adultery." Because God has ordained it, man does not stand before God and say, "No, I'm
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:54.080]   not gonna take this seriously." So everyone who comes into the covenant
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:25:01.120]   relationship is meant to be permanent. Now, the Scripture does
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:07.560]   give guidance that if you have married an unbeliever, do not to divorce. They use
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:13.920]   as an opportunity to share the gospel with them. But if, again, when the two
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:19.560]   believers come together, that they are never to separate. That we are to
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:26.800]   be sanctified, to grow, mature in that context. And then, finally, marriage is to
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:35.640]   be honored by establishing biblical role of the husband and wife. I would say in
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:42.960]   the church, I get the greatest pushback from this. That men are to lead and the
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:51.200]   women are to follow. I'm trying to see who's bothered by this. I get greater
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:55.000]   pushback on this than probably any other subject because this is where the rubber
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:02.720]   meets the road. But let me make this clear. We don't choose what's right and
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:07.000]   wrong based upon what is acceptable, what seems reasonable to us. We are, first and
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.200]   foremost, we have to be brilliant. What does the Bible say? The Bible clearly says
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:24.160]   that men were given the task to lead. And that's why He tells women to submit. But
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:34.240]   let me say this to the men. You have to be men first. You have to be men first. If
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:40.600]   you live your life like a child, you act like a child, you talk like a child, you
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:48.400]   behave like a child, and then you ask your wife to submit to you, no wonder
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:54.840]   they don't want to come. If you have a commanding officer whose sole purpose is
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:02.440]   to glorify himself, and he's acting selfishly, and he's asking you to submit
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:08.960]   so that he can have a better life, who's gonna follow this guy? So when a man
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:15.480]   stands up and is a man, and this is, this is the, again, the challenge in our culture.
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:21.840]   If you say you're a man, automatically it's toxic. So the lines are being blurred
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:27.200]   where men have to act like women and women have to act like men. Completely
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:33.920]   unbiblical. Men have to first act like men. Now I'm not telling you specifically
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:38.760]   what that means, but let me, let me get to something that I think is going to, if
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:44.200]   you haven't been bothered up to this point, it's gonna be bothering now, okay. If
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:52.160]   you're a guy who has habits that is causing your wife to be frustrated
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:57.520]   because you're playing games all day, and it's affecting your marriage, or maybe
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.760]   your spending habit, or whatever it is you're doing, your living self-centered
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:10.280]   lives, you're not acting like men. Because God called us to lead. He called us to
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:16.800]   lead. So when we tell or ask our wives to follow us and support us and submit to
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:23.880]   us, they need to know that if they follow us, that we're going to lead them to
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:30.560]   Christ. That they need to have confidence that if they submit to us, that we're
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:37.440]   looking out for their best interest. That if they honor us, that they are following
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:42.400]   men who have committed themselves to pick up their cross and lead them to the
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.120]   cross as well. But if they are not confident that that's what you are, you
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:51.920]   are doing, that's where you're headed, and then you say submit. Who's gonna submit
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:59.480]   to that? If she's not certain that that's where you're headed, if she questions
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:06.440]   your selfishness, then even though the Bible mandates this, you've shot yourself
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:14.720]   in the foot. And then you say, let's go. In order for marriage to be honored, men
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:23.120]   need to learn what it means to be men. To lead. To sacrifice. To put away childish
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:27.520]   things. I'm not saying that you can't play games. I'm not saying that you can't
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:36.160]   have hobbies. But if those things impede you being men in your home, before you
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:39.640]   shake the Bible and tell them, oh wives are supposed to do this, wives are
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:43.520]   supposed to do that, before that happens we need to take a long hard look at
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:53.120]   ourselves. Am I somebody that she can respect? So until men are first men, we
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:58.600]   cannot establish honor in the marriage.
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:10.120]   Having said that, women need to submit. What an outdated thing to say in
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:14.880]   this generation. And this is gonna be reported. There's some people who are
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:17.160]   watching. I don't know who's watching this. I'm sure somebody's gonna be
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:24.400]   offended. What I just said, I just quoted scripture. I remember the very first
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:31.560]   wedding that I was officiating and the future wife had a problem with that. I
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:37.000]   said, I don't want to say this word. It's not romantic. The non-christian guests
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:44.120]   who are coming are not gonna understand. So can you change that word? And I
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:53.280]   thought long and hard for four seconds. And I said no. Because I'm asking you to
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:31:02.600]   quote a Bible verse. A Bible verse. So if you cannot adhere to God's ordained
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:09.560]   mandate in scripture, you're not asking for the Lord's blessing. You can sign a
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:15.760]   piece of paper. You can get Elvis to come and officiate. But a minister of God in
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:20.360]   the right conscious cannot do that. Because he no longer represents Christ.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:28.480]   He represents the culture. He wants to appease you before he is obedient to God.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:35.800]   When a marriage is established where Christ is at the center, that's where
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:41.360]   true life is. That's where true life is. The reason why he told the disciples
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:44.720]   pick up his cross and deny himself is because at the other side of the cross
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:50.000]   was the resurrected life. So all that he has commanded in creation, all that he
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.040]   has commanded in this new generation is no different. God calls us to submit to
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:59.760]   the Word of God because the Word of God, when we practice the way that God has
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:06.720]   given it to us, is the path of life. It's where the children are raised, husband
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:10.720]   and wives are happy. If you ask a husband and wife when something goes wrong, you
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:15.480]   know what they typically say? The wife usually complains that they don't feel
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:19.840]   loved. And you know what the typical complaint of a husband is? I don't feel
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:25.760]   respected. Why do you think they say that? It's not because they look long and
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:29.640]   hard into the scripture and say, "Oh, they're supposed to respect me and honor me."
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:36.400]   No. Innately, that's how God has created us. For ladies to be loved and men to be
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:41.920]   respected so you can lead. It's embedded into creation. So when we give ourselves
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:49.160]   an obedience to that, we experience what God intended in creation. So we benefit,
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:57.920]   our children benefit, and our church benefits. Let me wrap it up in this.
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:04.080]   Having said everything I've said, I'm pretty sure I said enough to offend all
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:08.600]   of you. I'm pretty sure I've covered enough where there's not a single person,
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:15.320]   including myself, that is not indicted by what has been said. First and foremost, we
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:19.560]   must never compromise what the scripture says to appease the culture that we're in,
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:26.080]   no matter what the consequence. No matter what the consequence. Because it is not
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:32.080]   safe to disobey God. It is not safe because the place where I find refuge is
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:38.040]   in Christ. My refuge is not in this world. My refuge is not in the good
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:42.480]   reputation that I get from this world. My reputation doesn't come from the size of
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:46.840]   this church. That's not my refuge. My refuge is found in Him. So whatever
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:51.240]   storms may come as a result of running to Him is the safest place for any
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:56.120]   Christian to be. So we must never compromise the biblical truth. But
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:03.480]   number two, all of us are indicted by what I said. Every single one of us. If
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:07.400]   you go to a secular psychologist, they'll tell you, "Hey, you know what? You're the way
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:10.840]   you are because your mom treated you this way or your dad treated you this
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:14.000]   way. Because something happened to you when you were a little girl. Something
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.600]   happened to you when you were a little boy." And so they'll identify and then
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:20.960]   they'll say, "You're the way you are because somebody did this to you."
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:26.640]   And so you can easily live your life and say, "I am the way I am because I've been
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:31.600]   sinned against. And I sin against other people because I've been sinned against."
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:38.680]   If you're not a Christian, that may be a good justification. No Christian stands
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:45.040]   before God and say, "I am the way I am because of what they've done to me." Every
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:51.800]   single person who has become new by the blood of Christ stands in the presence
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:56.320]   of His throne of grace who says, "I am what I am because of what Jesus did for me.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:05.800]   I do what I do because He loved me. I am what I am despite all that happened in
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:14.240]   this fallen world. I am what I am because of what He did to me." All the filth and
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.880]   dirtiness and the pain that you experienced that came from your family,
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:28.880]   from relationships, where the curse gets reversed is in Christ. So I can stand
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:33.720]   here and tell you the pain that I've had, the things that I've been wronged, and
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:37.640]   I'm sure every single one of you to different degrees can say the same thing.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:42.960]   But the reason why you and I here are here is not to share with each other how
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:47.840]   painful our past has been. You and I are here together because Christ reversed
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:54.960]   this curse. He reversed this curse so that we no longer live. He said, "I hurt you
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:05.440]   because they hurt me." No, I love because He loved me. And that curse gets reversed
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:15.120]   in the home first. That's why marriage must be honored among all and this bed
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:20.760]   must not be defiled. Let's pray.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:31.080]   And as we ask our praise team to come, let's take some time to come before the
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:40.680]   Lord. Whatever sins that we have committed, however deep we feel indicted
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:48.920]   because of the Word of God, our hope is in Christ. You can't reverse this curse.
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:54.800]   You can't reverse what's been done by being good. The only power that can save
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:02.960]   us from our own sins is the power of the cross. So let's all come individually and
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:08.840]   collectively to refocus our attention on Christ, to be anchored in Him so that all
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:14.600]   that we do, all that we think, will be led by the blood of Christ. Let's take some
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:18.120]   time to pray as our worship team leads us.
