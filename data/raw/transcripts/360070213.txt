[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:27.720]   So Sports Day is probably one of the most fun days of the year for Berean.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.880]   It's the one day that the entire church comes together.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.240]   We just fellowship, we have fun, and we compete.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.720]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.760]   That's what we as Berean love doing.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.960]   We love competing, and we love eating.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.280]   So Sports Day is just a great time for that.

[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:15.800]   I would meet people at church, but it was really hard to get to know them.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.360]   So Sports Day is a great way to get to know people.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:28.360]   [MUSIC]
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.280]   Sports Day is just such a great opportunity just to get together with
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.600]   your fellow brothers and sisters that we're running this race with.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.880]   >> Too long, bro.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.000]   Keep it short.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.320]   Take all the glory, bro.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.720]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.840]   >> Give us some.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.320]   >> That's good, that's good.
