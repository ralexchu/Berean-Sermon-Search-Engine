[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700]   Well, what does it mean to be loved infinitely?
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.560]   That's the answer we're after today.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.840]   And to get the answer, we must first understand that God, for a time, passed over sin.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.520]   He simply passed over it.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.800]   He didn't bring final judgment on sinners in real time.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.680]   He would deal with sin finally, but only later in the cross.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.720]   Meanwhile, in the thousands of years of human history prior to the cross, God would show
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.240]   his forbearance.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.960]   We read about this in Romans 3, verses 22 to 26, where Paul writes this, "For all have
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.040]   sinned and fall short of the glory of God and are justified by his grace as a gift through
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.000]   the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.080]   to be received by faith."
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.480]   This was to show God's righteousness because in his divine forbearance, he had passed over
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.780]   former sins.
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.720]   It was to show his righteousness at the present time so that he might be just and the justifier
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.440]   of the one who has faith in Jesus.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.720]   This text is loaded with theology and meaning, and it answers this question of what it means
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.300]   to be loved infinitely.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.760]   Here now is Pastor John preaching in Austin, Texas on January 1st, 1998 to explain.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.760]   The problem is that he passed over sins.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.360]   He just passed over them.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.160]   Let me give you another illustration.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.960]   I'll make this up out of my own head.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.780]   Suppose there were anarchists who in their shrewdness and their technological prowess
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.780]   want to blow up the White House and kill the president and blow up his cabinet and kill
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.120]   all the leaders and throw America into chaos.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:05.240]   But owing to some very careful counter-espionage, they are detected in the last minute, and
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.440]   there's an averting, and the part of the White House that blows up does not have the president
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.440]   in it.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.440]   He escapes.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.940]   Many others die.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.680]   And these anarchists are found, most of them are kept alive as the machine guns settle
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:26.560]   down in there, and they're brought to trial for treason, the highest crime in the American
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.920]   Constitution.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.880]   Now what would it say to the nations, all of whom are watching, just as all the nations
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.640]   are watching or will be watching someday as God goes on to the throne as judge and the
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:52.480]   nations are gathered before him, what would it say if the panel of judges said, "Well,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.480]   since this is your only time of being caught like this, we'll let you all go.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.720]   In fact, we'll clothe you and we'll provide you vacations and, if you really want to ruin
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.120]   the analogy, eternal happiness."
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.800]   What would the nations say about the esteem with which we hold our president?
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:25.780]   It would say, "We don't value him very highly, and the security and coherence of this government
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.000]   is not a big deal to us."
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.240]   And that's what it would say about God.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:43.120]   If he can just forgive you and let bygones be bygones and nothing happen.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.320]   But that's not what happened.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:57.520]   He did not spare, but rather he put his son forward to demonstrate his righteousness because
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.800]   in his divine forbearance he had passed over sins previously committed.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   It was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.640]   Now, God could have done it another way.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.720]   He could have sent all of us to hell and the score would have been even.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:29.440]   And eternal suffering would have been an even score to sin because sin committed against
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:37.640]   an infinitely holy God is an infinitely heinous act and therefore deserves an infinitely long
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.640]   and painful suffering.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.680]   But God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:55.520]   him might be saved and therefore there is between God and hell a mediator and a savior.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:04.480]   And God in crucifying his son vindicated his glory for all who will hide in this Jesus
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:12.160]   and say, "Jesus and his name and his glory and his worth are my only hope of right standing
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.120]   with a holy judge."
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.480]   The foundation of your salvation is God's love for his glory.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.120]   God wants you saved, but he wants something more than that.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.320]   He wants his name to be honored.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.360]   He wants his righteousness to be vindicated.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.320]   He wants his holiness to be established and thus it cost him his son to preserve the glory
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.360]   of his name in saving sinners.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.280]   One last question, is this love?
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:57.040]   Is a God-centered crucifixion loving toward me or only toward God?
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.960]   The question betrays the world mindset.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.040]   You know why?
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:13.440]   It assumes that for us to be loved, God must make us the center.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.680]   Check yourself here.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.240]   Right here the message is coming down.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.720]   It's coming down to a test in your heart.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:34.400]   When you look at the cross, do you love the cross because it makes much of you or because
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   it enables you, an ungodly person, to enjoy making much of God?
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.800]   I wish I could make this land on you because if you were to agree that the point of the
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:07:02.040]   cross is not to make much of you, but to enable you in spite of hell-deserving sin to enjoy
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.280]   an eternity of making much of God.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.640]   If you agree with that, you will be so out of step with this culture, you will scarcely
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:17.000]   be able to watch television without weeping.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.040]   You will scarcely be able to sit in secular university classrooms without breaking inside
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.920]   at the almost universal assumption that makes non-sense out of the cross.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.640]   So test yourself here.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:43.480]   I plead with you because evangelical Christianity is profoundly contaminated with this mindset.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:52.480]   Book after book, message after message, making the cross an echo of my excellence and thus
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:59.120]   making it unintelligible for what it really is.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:09.800]   I believe that the love of God comes to its apex in the cross of Jesus for me and you
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:21.600]   because I define the love of God for me as that act by which in spite of all my sin,
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:34.560]   He takes me and makes me able to enjoy infinitely His making much of God.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.360]   That is what love is, which is why many of you need to be drenched with the love of God
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:46.920]   right now in a way vastly different than you thought when you were singing those songs.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:52.760]   Because you've been taught all your life long that self-esteem is the bottom line of all
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:58.200]   virtue and all health and all being-lovedness.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.160]   And it is not.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.920]   God-esteem.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.320]   Why do you go to the Grand Canyon?
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.240]   Why do you go to the Alps?
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:16.760]   Do you really go to the glories of creation to see how great you are?
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.080]   Tell me about it as you stand on the edge of the Grand Canyon.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:29.200]   You go there because you were made to see, behold, and enjoy greatness.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.660]   And the Grand Canyon is nothing compared to God.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:42.460]   You were made for God and you will find yourself loved when you awaken to the truth that to
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:55.640]   be loved infinitely is to be forgiven, cleansed, and enabled to see and to feel the wonder
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.400]   that God makes much of God.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   Amen.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.720]   Absolutely phenomenal point.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:07.000]   No one goes to the Grand Canyon to increase his self-esteem.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.460]   Pastor John has over the years put some qualifiers around that statement about the Grand Canyon.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:16.080]   You can see that, for example, in APJ 128, if you want more.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.040]   But still, this point holds.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:24.360]   We are loved infinitely by being freed by God to make much of Him.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.480]   So critical.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.520]   This sermon clip came to us from an Aggie, Sarah Jane.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.880]   This message was preached at Passion in Austin, Texas on January 1st, 1998.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.080]   Sarah Jane writes in, "Pastor John, thank you so much for the innumerable ways you have
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.360]   impacted my life through your preaching and teaching.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:45.200]   I first heard of you when I began as a student at Texas A&M University in the fall of 1998.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.440]   Earlier that year, you preached this sermon at Passion 98.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.420]   Although I wasn't present for the initial splash, the ripple effects of that day carried
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.200]   on in Austin through digital copies of your sermon.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.080]   I must have listened to this sermon at least 20 times throughout my undergrad and graduate
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.080]   school years.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.600]   It completely changed the way I thought about self-esteem versus God-esteem and answered
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.680]   how a just God could offer complete forgiveness to sinful people like me.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.940]   Thank you for your faithful preaching of God's truth to my generation.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.320]   May the ripple effects continue for many more to come."
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   Amen.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.840]   Thank you, Sarah Jane, for that testimony.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.840]   Thank you for the clip.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.000]   The entire sermon is available at DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.200]   It's titled, "Did Christ Die for Us or for God?"
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.200]   Great sermon clip.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.680]   All our clips are now crowdsourced.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.640]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons changed your life, and we share that clip with the
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   APGA audience.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   If you got one, email me.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.960]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens in
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.880]   the audio, and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:48.160]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.120]   That's an email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.840]   We are back Friday to look at spiritual warfare, particularly why does it seem that our spiritual
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:02.840]   battles are so often mediated through flesh and blood, through apparent human enemies.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:08.040]   It's an interesting topic I want you all to hear, and we will when John Piper returns
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.600]   to the studio with me on Friday.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.720]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   [END]
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:21.720]   John Piper's "The Word of God" is available on our website, www.desiringgod.org.
