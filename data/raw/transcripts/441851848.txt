[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   Good morning, my name is Tyler Lee and I'm Samantha's brother.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.040]   I'm a part of the youth group here and I graduated this past year from high school.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.240]   I've been coming to this church for over a year now.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.480]   Today I have the opportunity to share my testimony with you all.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.320]   I grew up in a Christian family and so I have been surrounded with biblical teachings and
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.480]   believe that God and Jesus existed ever since I was a child.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.320]   Church became a bigger part of my life when I moved to Irvine for the first time.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.040]   I began to learn about and realize what being a Christian entails.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.880]   I became a part of a supportive youth group and attempted to understand Scripture on my
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.600]   own but my heart was not fully in it.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.520]   I was not motivated to walk with God yet.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.520]   At the end of my freshman year when I attended a youth retreat, I felt that I was being called
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.720]   out to change and follow God.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.560]   Within the next year, after I reflected on my experiences and sermons from church, I
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.440]   decided to start my own walk with Christ and start giving my life to Him.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.760]   Yet I did not develop a strong faith as I was living for myself still.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.120]   My high school years was a time of difficulty for me.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.200]   I saw more differences between myself and those around me than I could find similarities.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.160]   This resulted in numerous conflicts between me and my family.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.240]   After my freshman year, I was taken out of public school because I and my family were
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.200]   unsatisfied with my education and enrolled in homeschool.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.640]   For the next two years, I felt completely dissatisfied for similar reasons, became increasingly
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.000]   sad and continuously added to my list of differences.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.240]   For a year during my junior year, I was in the state of Washington.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.000]   During this time, I lost touch with many people, formed only a few refreshed friendships, and
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.640]   felt very isolated.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.320]   I fell out of my devotions, prayer, and spiritual motivation.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.200]   I replaced these with reading whatever books and watching whatever videos interested me,
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.720]   working on my hobbies and other things that focused on me to escape how I felt.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.000]   I also developed much more conflict with my family because of this denial.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.480]   I did not reach out to the people I knew before until closely to the end of that year in Washington.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.560]   I saw how I still felt the same despite my attempts at denying it.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.760]   I saw how I wanted to change.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.040]   Religion and independence were what I believed would get me through life, but it's God whom
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.720]   I should rely on, so I submit to the authority of Christ as my Lord and Savior.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.040]   Up until the end of my year in Washington, I was blind to and had not carefully remembered
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.680]   the blessings and protections I had been given by God and my family.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.360]   Ever since I realized this, I held close to the Fiance 48.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.800]   Finally present, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.440]   is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is a good review, if there is any excellence and
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.280]   if anything is worthy of praise, dwell on these things.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.840]   I was blind because I did not take the effort to look for and meditate on these things around
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.560]   me but focused only on what was easy to see, the differences between people.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.320]   When I came to Berean this past year, I found a place I could belong, where I could see
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.840]   more similarities between me and others.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.200]   I feel that I have grown more in Christ than ever before, and though at the time have I
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.880]   found myself being convicted of my thoughts and sins or reminded of God's power, grace,
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.480]   and mercy by each sermon or Bible study I attended, as I do now, I have learned much
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.120]   about prayer, devotion, faith, and joy.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.800]   I have learned how to think more critically about my belief and how my actions are viewed
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   by God and other people.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.000]   Through the conflicts I had with my family, I believe that Christ has opened my eyes to
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.200]   see what he has given me through those around me.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.120]   I have noticed that despite the isolation caused by this pandemic, I was able to strengthen
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.200]   my relationship with those around me, something that I did not have the chance or ability
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.600]   to do only a year before.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.400]   I am thankful and joyful that I am connected with the body of Christ here.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   Thank you.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.600]   [applause]
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   [music]
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   [applause]
