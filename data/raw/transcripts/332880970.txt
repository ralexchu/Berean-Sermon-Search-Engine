[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   follow all over the world. For example, in psychology, there are a lot of people that
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.320]   would say that they're disciples of Sigmund Freud. You've heard that name, right? You
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.560]   know, he was famous for, he was the founder of psychoanalysis. Or there are some who follow
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.600]   spiritual leaders, like the Dalai Lama, for example, right, who was the head monk of the
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.680]   Buddhist order. So when people say that they're disciples, what they mean by that is that
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.320]   they're following the teaching and the examples of others, okay? But similarly, when we're
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.760]   talking about what does it mean to be a true disciple of Christ, what we're saying, what
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:53.400]   we're talking about here is that a true disciple of Christ is somebody who follows in his footsteps
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.760]   and does as he taught and of course as he lived. And you know, but in order to follow
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.840]   Christ and to be Christ-like, what has to happen first? We have to what? We have to
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.800]   enter into a relationship with Christ himself. And that's really where true discipleship
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.040]   begins. It begins when, you know, scripture talks about in Romans 10 that if you confess
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.160]   with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and you believe in your heart that God raised him
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.160]   from the dead, then you're going to be saved. For with a heart, for with your heart, a person
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.880]   actually believes, resulting in righteousness. Well, what you're believing from the heart
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.360]   actually is that he not only raised him from the dead, but he rose again and that will
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.480]   result in righteousness. And with the mouth, you confess, resulting in salvation. So being
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.040]   a disciple of Jesus Christ always begins with what he has done for the believer. It always
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.320]   begins with that. So let's think about that for a moment. What exactly has Jesus done?
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.280]   And you know, ladies, you have to get the gospel right. Because if you don't get the
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.520]   gospel right, you are going to be so shaped and influenced by the people out there that
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.040]   are getting the gospel wrong. And just as an aside, I wanted to throw this out here.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.280]   If you get a chance to watch the American Gospel, that is an excellent film. It's out
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.800]   there. You can even get it on your on-demand right now. But you need to know the gospel.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.760]   And it's very clear. We know that Jesus is the one that lived the perfect life that we
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.900]   should have lived when he was here in human form. And he died the death that we should
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.760]   have died. And he offered himself up as a substitute and a sacrifice for everyone who
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.360]   is willing to turn from their sin and to trust in him alone. And so being a disciple of Christ
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:52.920]   really begins when one has accepted the free gift of grace given by God. And that is turning
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.560]   from your sin again, fully trusting in that finished work of Christ, and who is your Savior.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.960]   And then, you know, of course we know that salvation is not of our own doing. It's not
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.520]   because of any good works you've done. It's all about that faith and that finished work
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.880]   by your faith alone in Christ alone. So that's one aspect of it. But also, part of being
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.760]   a disciple is denying self. Jesus talks a lot about that. We don't necessarily talk
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.120]   about the cost of being a disciple. But a true disciple is one that denies self. Luke
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.080]   9, 23, Jesus says, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself," which means that
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.800]   believers with the help of the Holy Spirit are willingly of their own accord saying no
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.840]   to self. And that's hard, right? Because you have to say no to your flesh, which is
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.840]   actually one of your enemies that you're dealing with. But we must say no to self,
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:01.240]   and we willingly set our desires and our wants and our lusts, and we bring those into submission
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.520]   to Jesus Christ. A true disciple is also somebody who not only denies self but willingly takes
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.640]   up her cross. In Mark 8, 34, Jesus says, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.440]   and come after me and take up his cross." And that's just another way of saying that
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:28.640]   by the act of your will, you are saying yes to Christ and his will, which again, sometimes
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.400]   can be quite painful, right? Because we again battle three enemies. I already said the flesh,
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.680]   but you're also battling the world. And of course, you're battling Satan himself because
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.040]   he likes to discourage believers, of course. And then finally, a true disciple follows
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:57.080]   him. Jesus says in Matthew 16, 24 to 25, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself,
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.640]   take up his cross, and follow me." So for whoever would save his life will lose it,
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:10.840]   but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. To follow Christ means to obey Christ.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.760]   Jesus says in John 15, 14, "You are my friends if you do what I command you." So out of love
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.520]   for Christ, it's always an out of a love for Christ, right? We're not talking about moral
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.600]   living. I mean, we are talking about moral living, but it has to come from a heart that
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.920]   loves Christ. That has to be your motivator. We obey out of love for Christ. We obey because
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:39.080]   we want to glorify him. To follow Christ also means to have just a fervent love for one
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:47.120]   another. So as a body of Christ, you know, all who belong to him, hopefully, you know,
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.880]   you're spending time with each other, practicing the one another's, building relationships.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.240]   In fact, the world will know that you are one of his by how you treat one another. John
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.440]   13, 35 says, "By this will men know that you are my disciples if you have love for one
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:13.440]   another." And so a true disciple desires to serve one another in the body of Christ. And
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:21.220]   so discipleship to Christ really begins when we hear these words, "To deny self, to pick
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:27.040]   up your cross, and to follow him, and then to obey those words." That's what Jesus tells
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:35.200]   us in his word. And so as true disciples, we are called to listen to him. In fact, if
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.120]   you are a Christian, it's the same, you know, to say that you're a Christian is the same
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.040]   thing as saying that you're a disciple of Christ. They didn't use Christian that much,
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.920]   the actual label Christian in the Bible as much as they would say the way or a disciple.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.500]   But it means the same thing. And so when we say we are a disciple of Christ, we're saying
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:01.780]   that we're committed to following in his footsteps according to his word and doing as he taught
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.320]   and living by the power and strength of the Holy Spirit. And that's just where faith comes
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.640]   in. I mean, real faith, that's real faith in action. No longer living for self, but
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:17.980]   living for Christ. The Apostle Paul probably reiterates that truth the best when he says
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.860]   in Galatians 2.20, "I've been crucified with Christ. It's no longer I who live, but Christ
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:30.500]   who lives in me. And so now the life that I now live, I live by faith in the Son of
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:37.420]   God who loved me and gave himself for me." So the Christian life is the discipled life.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:43.420]   It does start with that, but it also is the discipling life. It's not just a let go and
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:50.700]   let God. There's a big part of striving for holiness while abiding in Christ. And so,
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.620]   you know, we who are called to follow Christ, we're also commissioned by Jesus himself to
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:02.220]   help others to follow Christ. In fact, when we take initiative and we come alongside and
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:10.780]   we disciple others, it demonstrates our obedience out of love for God. Again, Jesus in John
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:16.380]   14.15 says, "If we love him, we will keep his commandments." And one of his commandments
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.900]   to all true disciples is to disciple others. And that's kind of where we're going to focus
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:29.220]   tonight. Why don't you turn to Matthew 28. And we're just going to kind of focus on the
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.540]   Great Commission. And I'm hoping that I'm going to have time to get through all the
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:38.620]   notes tonight, but I promise you if we don't get to cover everything, we'll just pick up
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:46.180]   where we left off tomorrow morning. But Matthew 28. So as you're turning there, this passage
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:52.500]   is known as the Great Commission. You're familiar with it, right? Yeah, the Great Commission.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.180]   It's really our biblical support, I think, for when we start talking about, you know,
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:03.740]   making disciples. We have to allow scripture to shape that, not someone's program. And
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.380]   so it's good for you to just kind of look at this passage with fresh eyes, and we need
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:13.580]   to kind of think through it a little bit because it's really important. But Matthew 28, and
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:21.140]   then just go to verse 18, and I'm just going to read from 18 to 20. "And Jesus came up
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:27.660]   and spoke to them, saying, 'All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:33.660]   Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:40.340]   Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:47.740]   you. And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.'" So as you can see
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:54.900]   there, that's a concluding passage, right, in Matthew. And again, referred to the Great
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.500]   Commission. And the cool thing is we just celebrated resurrection, right? The cool thing
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:05.420]   is this happened a week later. So the timeline is this would have been about seven or eight
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:11.780]   days later, after Christ had resurrected, and he's appearing to different people. So
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:18.700]   he met with his disciples in Galilee about seven to eight days later after the resurrection.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:25.020]   And so, you know, the reason why he met with them is he wanted to commission them. He's
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.820]   kind of passing the baton, so to speak, and giving them some instructions. But it's not
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:36.180]   just isolated to the disciples then. This is for all of us who claim the name of Christ
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:43.620]   and who desire to make disciples of all people. So as we begin to kind of unpack this passage,
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:50.660]   I want you to kind of just silently pray in your heart and, you know, allow the passage
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:56.900]   to really awaken your hearts this evening. Allow it to impact you and renew you in your
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:02.260]   individual calling, because we're all called to do this. This is not just for your pastor
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:08.420]   or for your elders or for your women's ministry or whatever. This is for all of us individually.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.420]   And so as I'm teaching through this, allow it to impact you personally, because it's
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:18.820]   meant to. It's the church's calling, and the church is not a building, right? The church
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.500]   is made up of a body of believers, and so this is an individual calling as much as it's
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:29.580]   a church calling. So let's bow our heads right now, and I'll just go ahead and pray. Father
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:36.940]   God, thank you so much for allowing me to come here today and to open up the Word with
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:45.140]   these ladies who love you and more just desire to grow more in their faith. And Father, it's
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:53.060]   just a wonderful opportunity to start from the beginning. When your dear Son rose again
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:58.780]   on the third day, and Father just appeared to all of those who didn't even believe that
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:04.140]   he really would do that. And here he is meeting with the original disciples, commissioning
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:10.060]   them, and because we know that your Word gives us everything we need for our life and godliness,
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:15.220]   and it's put there for our instruction, we know that these words are meant for us today.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:21.860]   And so I just pray that as we go through this passage carefully, that you'll just impact
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:27.900]   each heart out there today. I know that when your Word goes out, it never returns void,
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:34.260]   and so I'm just trusting you, Lord, to do the work. In Jesus' name, amen. All right.
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:40.020]   So here we've got, we'll begin with the claim of Christ, okay, the claim of Christ to his
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:47.300]   disciples. As Jesus gathered his eleven disciples up on that mountain in Galilee, he claims
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:54.780]   in verse 18, "All authority has been given, all authority in heaven and in earth has been
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:13:02.340]   given to me." So to begin, before we can even look at what Jesus is commanding us to do
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:07.860]   as far as making disciples, you need to know that it's really, really important that Jesus'
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:13.740]   claim as to his authority is the basis for everything that we do. You have to really
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:22.520]   have a firm, just claim or just trust in that. And so what is Jesus really claiming here?
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.060]   Look back at your scripture there. What is the first thing that we notice? He's claiming
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:32.900]   to have authority in heaven and earth. Did you know that that was prophesied in the Old
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:38.540]   Testament? When he claims to have authority in heaven and earth, Daniel actually talked
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:47.460]   about that. In chapter 7, verse 14, there was a time when Daniel prophesied that Christ
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:53.900]   would be, there would be, well, he said there would be a son of man who was given all authority
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.260]   to rule and to have glory and to have a kingdom of every people, nation, and language who
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:05.300]   would serve him. A kingdom that is an everlasting kingdom which will never pass away or be destroyed.
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:11.740]   And it's interesting that that text is actually talking about Jesus or the Messiah to come
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:16.780]   and that's what Jesus is claiming here in this passage. He is the one that Daniel was
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:22.420]   talking about. But Jesus also makes a claim about his authority over every believer in
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:30.780]   this room. In other words, Jesus is your personal Lord and Savior. Okay? You didn't just decide
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:36.380]   one day to make Jesus Lord and Savior. By the authority given to him in heaven and earth,
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:42.620]   Jesus just is Lord and Savior. You know what I'm saying? Right? Yeah. And, you know, we
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.660]   read about that all over scripture. One that I'm thinking of right now is Philippians
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:52.900]   2, 9 to 11, where after Jesus died and rose again, you know, he was exalted. So when he
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:57.860]   rose again, which you guys probably learned on Sunday from your own pastor, when he rose
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:04.460]   again he eventually ascended and is at the Father's right hand. So he is Lord over all
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:11.820]   creation no matter what the world tells you. He is Lord of all creation. He has absolute
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:19.660]   authority over nature, nations, diseases, sin, demons, death, and over every life in
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:27.740]   the world. And one day, even though the world has no clue, one day, one truth that we know
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:33.500]   for sure is that every knee will bow. Every knee. Every knee will bow and every tongue
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:39.060]   will confess Jesus is Lord. That is a guarantee. And so when we're talking about the Great
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:44.260]   Commission, like I said before, we're not talking about some special man-made program
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:49.580]   in your church. Because a lot of churches kind of make it seem like that. But that's
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:54.180]   not where we're at. We're talking about the authority that has been given to Christ in
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.620]   heaven and on earth. And that's what should motivate your hearts to make disciples of
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:05.060]   others. It's just thinking about who Christ is and the authority that he has in your life.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:13.780]   And so, you know, we go and we disciple others to follow Christ because we love Christ ourselves.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:19.620]   And we want to acknowledge his authority to others. That's hard on college campuses, isn't
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.940]   it? That's hard. I know what you guys are facing. I realize I work at a Christian school,
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.980]   but I deal with the secular community and counseling. And I know that's hard. But we
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:35.580]   have to stand firm in what we believe. And you don't need to be afraid, by the way, because
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.340]   the word has authority. You don't have to argue people into the kingdom. You just need
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:45.260]   to allow God to do his work and allow the word to do his work. OK? But, you know, we
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.580]   disciple others to follow Christ because we love Christ ourselves. And we want to acknowledge
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:55.480]   that. Jesus is our king. I mean, he is. And we are his subjects, so to speak. And we want
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.860]   to give him the worship that's due his name. I mean, I love it when we get to open up with
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.020]   singing. I love all of the music that we sang before we got started. I mean, it's part of
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:11.940]   worshiping our king because that is who he is. And we should all desire for others to
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:20.220]   say and confess with their own mouth that Jesus is Lord. Right? Amen on that? Yes. Yes.
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:26.720]   Amen and amen. Now, after Jesus claims his authority over heaven and earth to his disciples,
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:34.240]   that's when he begins to urge the disciples to make disciples. He says, "Go, therefore,
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.280]   and make disciples of all nations." And so really what he's saying there is he's saying,
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:45.320]   "In light of my authority, I want you to go." That's the command, to go. If you want to
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:51.240]   parse it out in the original language, actually that verb translated "go" is a present participle.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:57.280]   How do you like that for college students? But it's a present participle, going. And
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:02.600]   so what Jesus is saying to all of us who consider ourselves true disciples of Christ is, "While
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:09.480]   you are going, make disciples of all the nations." So no matter where you're going, you're called
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.840]   to be actively witnessing for Christ by seeking to win others to him and then teaching new
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:21.240]   disciples to follow him or teaching them what you yourself have been taught according to
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:27.240]   the scriptures. And that's how it's been from the beginning and will be to the end. To be
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:33.680]   a disciple is to make disciples. I mean, scripture doesn't know of any disciple in the Bible
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.720]   that's not making disciples. That's normal Christian living. That is part of being a
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:45.800]   Christian is making disciples. In fact, in this entire passage, there's really only one
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:53.120]   main command to his disciples, which is to make disciples. Okay? Now, when we're talking
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:59.120]   about making disciples, within that passage itself, there's four goals that we can look
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.920]   at that's really, really helpful, I think, as you're kind of thinking through this whole
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:10.400]   issue. And the first one, of course, is just to share the truth about Christ. According
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.320]   to verse 19, the early disciples were told to go beyond the nation of Israel, and they
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:21.520]   were called to call others to repentance and belief. And so these disciples spoke the gospel
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.480]   as they lived out the gospel. And it's not any different today. I mean, as we're going,
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:33.960]   we should be sharing the gospel as we have opportunity. You know, I mean, it's one of
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.200]   those things where you have to pray for opportunity, and you have to be willing to share when you
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:44.000]   get opportunity. Again, I think what stops people is fear of man. Right? We just need
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.160]   to trust that the Lord is going to do his work, and trust in the authority that Christ
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.680]   has and that he has in his word. I think a really practical way to share Christ, to be
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:00.920]   quite honest, is to just, you know, grab coffee with somebody and to just share your testimony.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:05.120]   I think that is a great way to break the ice. You know, you're building relationships with
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.320]   people, and they want to know what's different about you. That's what always comes up. They
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:15.080]   want to know why, when I'm around you, you're not acting like the world. What's different
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:19.320]   about you? Why do you have joy when you go through trials? You know, why are you not
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:25.760]   cursing like the rest of them? Kind of a thing. And so, a great way is just to share your
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:32.760]   testimony. You know, part of my testimony, I was liberal as all get out, ladies. Totally
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:40.840]   feminist. My neighbor, a woman, her name is Jodi, I love her, took a risk. She came over
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:47.600]   when we bought our first house, and she became my friend. And through that friendship, over
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:54.200]   time, she began to share her testimony. And then she began to share more truth. And then,
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.120]   you know, it just kind of goes on and on. And then she began to invite me to church,
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:04.600]   right? And so, the good news is, is the church was solid. And so I heard the gospel every
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:11.640]   single Sunday because we had a very faithful gospel preacher, you know. And it's just amazing
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.480]   to me to think that she took a risk, number one, because it was probably a little bit
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:21.560]   intimidating. But as she was witnessing to me, and as the pastor was doing his work,
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:28.560]   preaching well, the Spirit of God was bearing witness to me through these people in my life.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:35.360]   And God is the one in his kindness and mercy who granted me repentance and redeemed my
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.960]   heart as I placed my faith in that finished work. So, praise the Lord. Jodi obeyed the
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:46.760]   Lord, you know, and she was willing to come and reach out to me and share the truth about
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:52.280]   him. So, maybe you have neighbors. How many of you have neighbors? All of us have neighbors,
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.080]   yeah. You know, whom you need to reach out to. You just never know what God's going to
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:04.040]   do. You know, you can share Christ with God. Actually, he doesn't have to, but God does
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.680]   use people to get the gospel to others. I never grew, I didn't grow up in a Christian
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.320]   family. I have very liberal upbringing, so I never heard the gospel in my whole life
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:18.800]   until I was 27, okay? And I would have thought Christians were crazy anyway. I wouldn't have
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:25.520]   talked to them. So, it's just amazing that the Lord used somebody in that way in my life.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:32.360]   And it's just amazing that I was even willing to listen to her. But God is the one doing
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:37.320]   the work. He's drawing people near, you know, he's tenderizing the heart, as it were. He's
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:43.280]   allowing the word to have an impact. But making disciples doesn't end just with sharing the
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:48.640]   truth with people. I mean, that's a big part of it. But according to the second part of
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:54.120]   verse 19, when people respond to the gospel, that is to say they've turned from their sin,
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:23:01.640]   they've turned to Christ, from that point, they symbolize their identification with Christ
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:07.400]   through believers' baptism, right? And that's, of course, we do that in the name of the Father
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:13.160]   and the Son and the Holy Spirit. And that's actually a command from Christ himself. We
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:18.920]   don't get baptized to become a Christian, right? We become a Christian and then we're
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:25.760]   commanded in scripture here to make a declaration of our faith in Christ through believers'
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:32.600]   baptism. And that just becomes the opportunity, once again, to share our faith with others.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.160]   Because after my neighbor shared the truth with me and I became a believer, then she
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   did a great job of discipling me because she continued in her discipleship of me by having
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.120]   me write out my testimony. She helped me to make an appointment with the pastor to kind
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:53.360]   of get this whole baptism thing down. Of course, it was completely frightening. But that's
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.440]   part of it. And within the next few months of being a new believer in an evening service,
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.760]   you know, I got to get up and do that whole bit. I'm sure you guys do that as well. You
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.720]   have baptisms. Do you have baptisms here in the evening kind of a thing or baptismal services?
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:18.240]   But anyway, you know, before you, usually before your pastor or an elder baptizes you,
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:23.000]   you have a few moments to give about a 10-minute testimony typically. And the neat thing is
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.440]   is that my husband wasn't saved yet. Okay? So I was able to use that opportunity because
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:36.040]   he was at least willing to come and listen to that and observe that. And the Lord used
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.240]   that testimony over time, drawing him near. And he got saved about a year later. It's
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.720]   incredible. It's incredible what Lord, that's just the providence of God. That's nothing
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:51.880]   that we're doing. It's amazing. It's amazing what God will do in a person's life. And so
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:57.360]   you can use testimonies at baptisms. If you have friends, family members, I brought my
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:05.720]   unsaved parents to my children's baptisms. That's such a great way to again just acknowledge
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:11.200]   Christ to be able to share the truth about Christ. So yeah, if you're a true disciple
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.000]   of Christ and you have not been baptized, you actually realize you're living in disobedience,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.440]   you need to think about that. Okay? Because we are called to symbolically identify with
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:28.880]   Christ through our baptism, believer's baptism that is. Okay? Now, not only does Jesus commission
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.920]   his disciples to share the truth about him and symbolize or identify with him through
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:41.360]   baptism, but really the third goal of making disciples is to be committed to showing the
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:52.880]   word of God by teaching others to obey Jesus's commands. In verse 20, we read, "Teaching
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:26:01.560]   them all that I have commanded you." Okay? So teaching us that we don't just receive
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.200]   the word from those who witness to us like my neighbor did. And you know, sometimes people
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:12.280]   get saved and they just sit in their churches, they soak it in, and then I call, what I say
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:18.320]   is they sour because they're not doing anything. They just sit, soak, and sour. And they just
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.080]   show up week after week and they don't do anything. They don't involve themselves in
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:28.600]   the body of Christ. Actually, true disciples of Christ have a biblical responsibility to
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:34.200]   show the word of God through evangelism and through teaching others what they themselves
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:39.120]   have been taught. And part of showing the word does happen in our local churches as
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:44.480]   you listen to your pastor preach week after week, but also showing the word of God happens
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:51.000]   in the life on life relationships. You know? Are you having community with one another?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.080]   Right? That's an important aspect of the Christian life. Of course it's going to happen. I mean,
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:02.640]   women are so relational. I'm sure it's happening all the time. When we meet regularly, it gives
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:09.320]   us an opportunity, especially with new believers, to model the Christian life by showing others
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.160]   how to pray. I mean, I didn't know how to pray as a new believer. Did you know how to
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:21.520]   pray? That's a tough one. You have to model that a lot of the times. We disciple because
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:27.320]   we want to teach people how to study God's word in context and just things like that,
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.160]   how to grow in Christ through that, how to lead others to Christ. I mean, that's what
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:37.160]   church life is all about. And so that's what making disciples is all about. And I praise
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:43.480]   God for the women in my church when I was a new believer who came alongside me and they
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.840]   just willingly and lovingly taught me so many things. Sometimes I would just meet with them
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.680]   in groups. You know, you have your typical women's Bible study and you learn lots that
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:58.160]   way. But I just treasure those times when there were women that allowed me to come over
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:04.440]   to their home and they showed me how to be a godly wife and mother. I mean, that's tough
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:10.080]   because I already had children that were five, six, and a newborn. And so I had already poured
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:17.320]   in all of the psychologized self-esteem stuff into my kids. And I had to relearn how to
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:23.320]   be a Christian parent. And I praise God for the, just the patience of some of these women
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.700]   who came alongside me and modeled, you know, Christ in their life. And that's just part
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:32.200]   of life on life. We're not an island. We're not to isolate from each other. That's a big
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:38.840]   part of Christian living. And so it's important for you as well to come alongside other women
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:45.760]   and have other women come alongside you. Discipleship is just so vital so that you can grow and
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:52.800]   you can mature in Christ. And also just to be able to give that opportunity to model
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:59.000]   in daily life. That's just normal. In fact, we find support for this in Scripture. So
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.920]   I'm going to invite you, we're going to, we're still under showing the word. So I'm just
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.200]   going to invite you now to kind of turn to Titus 2. We're going to look at this for a
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:12.040]   little bit. We'll segue a little bit. And then we'll go back to our commission passage.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:18.280]   But you know, Scripture has a lot to say about women discipling other women. It's a big part
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:24.520]   of what we should be doing with one another, no matter if you're married, old, young, single,
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:32.200]   we're all called to do it. But Titus 2, 3 to 5, I'm going to read, Paul's writing to
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:37.760]   a bunch of churches. He's not just writing to one church. He's writing to various churches.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:44.920]   And he writes, "Older women, likewise, are to be reverent in their behavior, not slanderers,
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:50.280]   or slaves to much wine. They're to teach what is good, and so train the younger women to
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:57.040]   love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled, pure, working at home, kind, and submissive
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:03.680]   to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be reviled." And so here we have Paul,
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:10.000]   again, you know, there's primary things that are going on here. He needed Titus to go out
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.360]   and put in order what remained in the churches, and he also needed to appoint some elders.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:21.160]   There were a lot of things going on at the time. But part of what he was doing, as far
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:28.680]   as putting in order what remained, was trying to teach groups of people what was appropriate
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:34.160]   for sound doctrine. And we're looking at two of those groups, the older women and the younger
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:40.520]   women. There's specific commands, obviously, for us. And as you can see, as far as the
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:45.880]   older woman goes, there's really no age that's particularly specified. I mean, we know that
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:51.400]   she was an older woman. We know that she was probably—we just assume that she's been
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:58.320]   married long enough to at least have something to say about marriage. We also know that she's
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:03.640]   probably passed through the season of life, you know, probably has grown children, has
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:08.160]   passed through the season of having little ones. He's probably talking about someone
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.480]   like me, you know, someone that's a little more gray-haired. But, you know, in the New
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:18.640]   Testament times, I mean, women served all in the church in numerous ways, not just in
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:25.120]   this way. But here, Paul is just kind of talking about the responsibilities of older women
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.760]   to teach and train the younger. That's a big thing. And to teach and train the younger
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:35.880]   in the things of the Lord, which is actually just another way of saying making disciples.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:41.800]   So let's kind of look a little bit at the older woman. What is she to be like? What's
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:47.600]   that first characteristic? She's to be what in her behavior? Say the word. Yeah, reverent,
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:54.800]   right? She's to be reverent in her behavior. And that's an adjective, okay? It's an unusual
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:02.760]   combination if you look in the original language. It's kind of like saying, it's kind of a weird
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:09.600]   word really, but he kind of just means like being a priestess in a temple, somebody that,
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:15.160]   you know, has a holy way of living. And do you guys know who Anna the prophetess is in
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.120]   Luke? She would be an example of what Paul, where Paul is getting at. She was widowed
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:25.480]   at a young age. Anna was probably widowed when she was in her 20s. It's kind of amazing
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:31.720]   to think about, especially in that culture. And she didn't remarry. So what she did her
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:37.920]   whole life is she prayed day and night and fasted in front of the temple until Christ
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:46.600]   came. It's a wonderful story. And so she was known for being devout and holy. And that's
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:51.160]   kind of what he's getting at here. An older woman, an older Titus 2 woman should have
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:59.320]   reverence in that way. You know, it also says that older women are not supposed to be slanderers,
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:05.800]   right? And that is kind of an interesting word again, because it means not to be devilish
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:12.960]   or not to be malicious. And so the idea that Paul is trying to convey there is that people,
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:18.560]   in this case older women, who cannot control their tongues by speaking lies or making false
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:24.360]   accusations or spreading malicious gossip, whether it's true or not, is really doing
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:31.160]   the work of Satan himself. And so, you know, that exhortation to master the tongue, why
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:38.320]   is it only especially directed towards women? What do you think? Do we kind of get caught
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:44.840]   up this way a little bit? Where there are many words, ladies, where there are many words.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:49.960]   But if we're going to exemplify, and I realize that a lot of you are not, you know, aged
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:56.720]   like me, you're young, but you should be aspiring or you should be training yourself up in this
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:02.160]   way. You need to think through these things. And, you know, you need to think about your
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:09.200]   conversations with one another. Are your conversations with one another God-honoring? Or are you
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:15.840]   getting caught up in gossip kind of thing? Are you using words that build up? Are you
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:22.120]   using words that edify? Are you giving grace to those who hear them? And so that's kind
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.800]   of where he's getting at, that we need to have, well, out of the heart the mouth speaks,
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:30.680]   and so really it's a heart issue if you're getting caught up in that. But, you know,
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:37.920]   what are your words like these days? And then he also talks about women, older women shouldn't
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:44.320]   be enslaved to much wine. I mean, the emphasis there is enslaved, actually. You know, the
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:49.480]   older woman isn't to be a drunkard. She's not to be in bondage to the wine of her day.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.960]   So it kind of gives you some insight into the culture. I wonder if they had a lot of
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:59.280]   trouble with drinking, which is interesting. And so, you know, that's kind of what he's
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:04.560]   getting at specifically, but can we be enslaved to other things today? What do you think?
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:12.000]   Yeah? It's not just alcohol. We can be enslaved to our emotions. And in contrast, though,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.720]   Paul's just saying we need to exhibit self-control. So this is not a perfect woman. This is just
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:22.680]   a faithful woman. That's what he's trying to emphasize. She's striving after godliness
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:28.200]   while abiding in Christ. She's trusting in God, and she's doing what is good. And one
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:34.480]   aspect of being devoted to doing what is good and making disciples is being willing to come
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.680]   alongside other women and putting into practice what Titus 3 is talking about, which is to
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:46.920]   teach what is good and to train, which leads us to the commitment of the Titus 2 woman,
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:55.280]   the commitment of the Titus 2 woman. You know, as many of us know, and I'm sure you've experienced,
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.480]   I know I have, you're going to be exposed to so many teachers in your life. There's
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:04.480]   just so many people that want to speak into your life, a lot of different things. They
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.720]   want to give you advice about everything. I bet when you were pregnant with that little
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:13.080]   one, probably everybody wanted to give you advice on how to be a mommy, right? So there
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:17.680]   are just so many people that want to speak into your life, but really here, Paul's just
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:24.640]   trying to say, look, you know, the ideal model is for a seasoned Christian woman to come
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:30.600]   alongside another woman, a younger woman, and to train her and to teach her what is
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:38.520]   good. That's the idea. And so he's talking about, you know, the kind of teaching would
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:44.960]   be noble instruction or excellent instruction or holy instruction. And in the context of
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.880]   the letter, the primary goal would just really be to come alongside younger women and just
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:54.680]   commit to making them disciples by teaching them what they had been taught themselves
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:37:00.960]   to help them grow spiritually. From this passage, part of the teaching, what was good, was just
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:07.320]   modeled or training. You have to take culture into view here. But that part of it is just
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:12.720]   encouraging women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be sensible, which
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:18.000]   just simply means sober-minded, to be pure workers at home and submissive to their own
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.040]   husbands. And the reason why is so that the word of God won't be reviled. And so there
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.760]   – and just, you know, don't check out right now if you're single. This isn't
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:33.640]   just for married women, okay? You're still commanded as a single woman to be sober-minded,
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:38.160]   to be pure, to be even a worker at home. You ever thought about that? You think being a
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.400]   worker at home is just isolated to married women? It's not. That's for you as well.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:48.080]   You need to be a worker at home. It just means manage your home. To be sensible so that the
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:55.080]   word of God will not be reviled in your life. And so for me, you know, I love coming alongside
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:59.800]   younger women. I mean, that's a big part of my ministry is college age and teaching
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.860]   them these things. And just even teaching them what it means to have – to be submissive
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:09.080]   to authorities in their life if you're not married. I mean, that's a big part of it
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:14.240]   as well. So the commitment should be just to train a generation of women to love and
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.320]   fear the Lord through modeling and through the teaching of sound doctrine rather than
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:23.680]   giving out worldly advice. I'm through with worldly advice. I want some advice from God's
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.080]   word, right? I want to know what God has to say on these subjects. And he gives us everything
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:33.160]   we need for life and godliness. He speaks to issues in life. And so you've got to
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:40.600]   believe that we have a sufficient word that speaks to issues in life. And the same goes
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.440]   for your children. We ought to – if you have children, you ought to be your children's
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:49.760]   primary disciples. You should be shaping, investing in your kids and helping them in
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:55.080]   that way. Now I think given the culture at the time, a lot of what's happening here
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:01.120]   in Titus probably happened in the privacy of women's homes. So it's a little different
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:05.640]   for us today. We can still do it that way, but there's different scenarios. You know,
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:11.880]   there's all kinds of ways that we apply Titus 2. Of course we go into people's homes
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:17.400]   and do the one-on-one discipleship. Like I said, I treasure those days when I had that
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:23.720]   in my life. Even if the women failed, you know, even if they failed, it was a good thing
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:29.440]   to see because I got to see how they worked through conflict. I got to see forgiveness
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:34.880]   being extended, things like that. That's just so huge, I can't even tell you. How
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.200]   do you teach that? You know, you got to model those kinds of things. You got to see it lived
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:44.720]   out. That's why discipleship is so important. I think in the church today, some other ways
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:50.280]   this can be modeled is, you know, I would say probably biblical counseling would be
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:57.040]   one, that formal setting. It's still a one-on-one thing, but that kind of looks like me coming
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.720]   alongside another woman and just kind of helping her to understand how to apply God's Word
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:06.680]   in difficulty. So that's one aspect. How many of you are going through the ACBC training?
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.800]   How many of you are learning that right now? Okay. Yeah, so you know what I'm talking
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.840]   about. You know, someone comes along, they have a pattern of sin in their life, and they're
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:19.240]   really just needing some help with how do I repent of this? How do I deal with the sin
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:25.000]   in my life? You know, and then just kind of teaching them how to deal with things like
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.960]   that. And we'll actually be talking about that tomorrow. I'll get a little bit deeper
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:34.440]   into that. I think it can be a public ministry, too. For example, how many of you are like
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:40.520]   in a small group? You know, that's kind of A-form. Yeah, quite a few of you. Where you've
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:44.480]   got a woman kind of leading you through the scriptures, because you want to learn it in
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:50.320]   a deeper way, apply it to your life. And that's what that happens. Or even in a women's conference
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:56.060]   like this. And so again, you know, I'm thankful that I was allowed to experience all of those
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:41:01.080]   things. And I've just learned so much from other women that it's just something that's
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:08.440]   just amazing to think about. But to kind of sum up, on the issue of women making disciples,
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:16.400]   my pastor back home wrote this quote. He says, "Teaching what is good requires the seasoned,
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:23.000]   mature Christian woman to be committed to being responsible, confrontive, and affirming
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.400]   in an ongoing relationship with a younger woman." So really the key phrase in all of
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   that is ongoing relationship. It's really key, so I would circle it. That's really part
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:40.560]   of the goal. And we all need to be women committed to sharing the truth about Christ, symbolizing
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:46.280]   or identifying through baptism, and then showing the word by teaching other women what is good
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:52.520]   and hopefully when you have that life on life, being able to model some of the teaching what
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:58.080]   is good, which means it should be happening regularly and consistently. And you know,
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:02.760]   this is one way God has basically ordained in his church how women are to grow within
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:07.840]   the context of discipleship. So you may be the seasoned Christian woman out there. I
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:14.160]   don't know. I don't know your ages. And so for you, you know, you might be thinking about
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:19.200]   who, you know, I haven't discipled anyone. Is there someone in my sphere of influence
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:24.640]   that I need to be thinking about coming alongside and investing in? Or you may be the younger
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:30.520]   woman out there who also is committed to making disciples. You know, you can do that. I teach
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:37.840]   that class. I teach college women how to do that within the context of young personhood.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:42.720]   But or little children if you have kids. Or if you serve in youth group. I mean, that's
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:47.160]   a relationship. You know, young people really need to know and really want to hear from
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.800]   you. I was at a high school group a couple of weeks ago and you know, they wanted me
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.600]   to talk to them about social issues. They had some really deep questions for me. They
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.720]   wanted to know how to deal with comparing themselves on social media. That's a hot issue.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:08.640]   And they really struggle with the self-image deal, comparing. They wanted to talk about
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:13.360]   how to handle when they have, most of them have a friend that's dealing with transgender
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:18.040]   issues. I'm sure that is not, that is something you're dealing with. How do I deal with a
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:22.840]   friend that's struggling in that way? They wanted to know about biblical womanhood. I
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:27.400]   think you can all probably come alongside a young person like that and probably disciple
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.360]   them and help them walk through those issues. Because you need to help them to learn how
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:36.920]   to shape their answers, not by the culture, but by God's word. Seriously. And so I was
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.600]   kind of encouraged that they were even asking the question and we were even having the conversation.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:47.240]   It was great. So I just want to encourage you, whether you're married or single, young
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:52.800]   or old, it's just really important that you take this seriously. Because I know it's a
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:59.080]   challenge. You know, we want to be self-sufficient. We don't want to be in these kinds of relationships
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:04.560]   because that means I've got to be transparent. Okay? And there's a lot of fear in that. But
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.480]   that is normal Christian living. We have to be with one another and able to encourage
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:14.680]   one another to love and good deeds and to grow spiritually. It's just part of the walk.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:21.400]   Okay? So we talked about the three goals and the last thing that we want to cover as far
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:30.360]   as the four goals is making disciples also means serving the world. Okay? Going back
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:36.120]   to our passage now, kind of moving back to Matthew 28, at the end there Jesus says, "To
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:41.080]   make disciples," he says, "for us to make disciples of all nations." And he doesn't
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:47.240]   mean simply nations or even countries. He's actually talking about tribes and families,
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:54.240]   neighbors, clans. You know, there are over 6,000 people groups that haven't been reached
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:45:00.280]   yet. So he's saying get out there. And, you know, for some of us we can travel and we
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:05.160]   can do that. I do that. You know, Jen mentioned a little bit about that. But not all of you
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:12.200]   can do that. Not all of you have that situation. But you can certainly start making disciples
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:19.480]   in your own families or perhaps it's your spouse or your children. Maybe it's your siblings.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:24.120]   Maybe you have unsaved parents. That's your mission field. You know, it could just be
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:29.920]   your neighborhood. It could be your workplace. You know, contrary to what people are telling
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.840]   you the world is not getting better. I'm sorry to disappoint you. But the world is not getting
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:40.900]   better. And even worse, a lot of your friends and neighbors are probably following false
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:46.240]   religions and that's even sadder. And so they need Christ as much as you need Christ. Do
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:53.240]   you think you need Christ? Do you need Christ? Yes. Your friends need Christ too. So serve
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.680]   the world by reaching out to your own mission field and the Lord can work through you like
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:05.480]   he did my neighbor 27 or so years ago. Finally, after learning that we must obey Christ by
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:13.720]   making disciples, Jesus gives us a wonderful promise in verse 20. Look there for a second.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:21.680]   He says, "And behold, I am with you always to the end of the age." It's really comforting
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:27.360]   to know that we're promised by Christ himself that as we're making disciples, he's going
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:32.520]   to actually, this is what I was talking about before, we don't need to fear because as you're
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:37.800]   going out and making disciples, whether that's sharing the gospel or teaching others what
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:46.000]   you yourself know, Jesus promises to be spiritually present with you until the end of the age.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.120]   And that just kind of means until he returns a second time. Are you praying for that by
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:56.800]   the way? That Christ will return? Because he's coming. You should be praying for that.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:03.960]   And so as believers, we don't have to be anxious about our life. We shouldn't be worried about
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:10.680]   making disciples because it's not based on you as much as it's based on Jesus and what
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:15.160]   he can do through your life. And so we just need to have a willing heart. We need to have
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:23.120]   an obedient heart and to remember overall that the Lord is with you and he's for you.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:27.880]   He's not against you. I mean, what more do you need to persevere in this life? I mean,
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:33.040]   seriously, what more do you need to be discipled or to be a discipler? God is going to be with
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:40.240]   you regardless of your successes, your failures. He's with you. And so you need to trust him
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:45.040]   and ask yourself if you're going to go and make disciples. It's really, really important.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:49.960]   Okay, so that's kind of the foundation. We have to lay that foundation before you kind
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:55.240]   of get into any kind of biblical counseling training or anything like that. We have to
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:01.520]   know where the authority is and what scripture says in reference to what it means to make
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:08.040]   a disciple and to be a disciple. So with that foundation in mind, I have time because you're
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:11.520]   going to go into your small groups type thing about 9 o'clock, so I'm going to go ahead
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:19.040]   and try to get through some of that last part. We're going to sort of transition now into
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:25.600]   deeper discipleship, page 10. And this is where we start thinking more specifically
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:32.120]   about sheep to sheep. How do we deal with people, broken people in the church? The hard
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:39.160]   people, right? The people that are just difficult to deal with. I think in a spiritual sense,
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:45.520]   the church is like a hospital, okay? I say that because, you know, I know that we're
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:50.200]   all new believers or new creatures in Christ as believers, but we're all kind of recovering
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:58.520]   in a way from radical heart surgery ourselves. But we still battle with this residue of sin.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:03.920]   You know, we're not perfected, this side of heaven. And so inevitably, we're going to
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:09.000]   find ourselves in situations where we need to be involved in deeper discipleship relationships
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.360]   with other people who are struggling. I am sure you've had many friends come to you in
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:20.080]   tears needing to talk about stuff. And so I'm hoping to kind of help you think through
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:26.160]   what do we talk to them about when they're struggling in a deeper way as they're stumbling
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:33.760]   along, right? And so you get this privilege when this happens to administer in love with
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:38.080]   the right bit of medicine, which of course is God's word, to reorient somebody back to
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.480]   good spiritual health. I think one of the things I want to probably throw out there
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:49.080]   right away, because this is kind of something that happens in biblical counseling, you know,
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:55.480]   people are not problems attached to people. They're not your project. Okay? We come alongside
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:50:01.080]   people out of care and concern for them, wanting to help reorient them back to Christ. So we
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:05.720]   need to think of it that way. It's not a medical model. I am a doctor, but I'm not that kind
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:12.040]   of doctor, right? And so this is ministry. This is loving people. This is a one another
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:16.800]   ministry actually. And so you need to kind of have that attitude when you think through
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:24.360]   this kind of a ministry. We want to help somebody that's off track with Christ. My favorite
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:30.520]   scripture in the Bible is 1 Thessalonians 5.14, I can't even talk, which says, "And
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:36.680]   we urge you, brethren," it's on your outline, "And we urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly,
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:43.480]   encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, and be patient with all men." And so Paul's
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:48.000]   actually giving you three categories of people, actually kind of four if you want to throw
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:54.840]   in patience there, but he's actually giving us a way that we can understand how to disciple
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:51:00.800]   certain groups of people when they're kind of caught up in certain kinds of behaviors,
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:06.240]   if you will. This is what I call deeper discipleship, when you come alongside helping people with
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:11.720]   particular struggles like this. And what's the first struggle that Paul's talking about
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:19.160]   there? What's the first one? What's the first kind of person? Say it out loud. That's right,
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:25.200]   unruly. That word just means disordered. You know, a person that's disordered, it kind
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.360]   of is a military word. The visual he's trying to give you is this person is going along
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:35.040]   and they're just completely out of line, completely not keeping within their rank, so to speak.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:40.240]   It kind of gives you a picture of someone who's just insubordinate or rebellious, maybe
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:47.680]   non-submissive. They just don't obey, basically. I call them the unbenders in counseling. I
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:52.120]   get them a lot. They're just kind of out of step with the rest of the soldiers in church,
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:56.720]   if you will, and they are just rebellious towards God's word and what it has to say
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:01.680]   for their life and just even in Christian living. They're not always unbelievers. A
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:06.680]   lot of them are believers, but they're just living in a very undisciplined way. And so
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:13.880]   it has a lot of faces in church. Unruliness is not just one thing. So it's kind of tough
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:21.320]   to pinpoint all of them, but in Thessalonica, in that church, the unruly people were the
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:27.360]   people that refused to work. They wanted everybody else to take care of them. And so, you know,
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:31.000]   they were just kind of expecting others to come along and support them, but Paul says,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.360]   "Look, if these people don't work, then they shouldn't eat." And so that kind of unruliness
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:41.840]   can happen in a church. But more often than not, what you're going to see is unruliness
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:45.560]   that you're going to see in churches typically are people that slander the leadership, you
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:52.320]   know, say things to kind of divide the church. That's unruly. That's very unruly. Or people
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:57.080]   that are engaging in adultery or people that are engaging in any kind of sexual immorality,
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:02.400]   that's unruly. That is completely out of step with Christ, right? So that's where he's getting
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:07.440]   at. People who are enslaved to alcohol, that kind of thing. I mean, I was helping a woman
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:13.800]   in a local church who would say she's a committed believer, completely enslaved to alcohol,
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:20.240]   you know? That's how she handles her problems. She's under pressure. And that's her false
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:24.160]   savior. That's what she turns to, to deal with the pressure in her life. So there's
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:29.200]   lots of people that would name the name of Christ and still struggle in this particular
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:33.720]   way. And that would be another example of unruliness. And so there's lots of different
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:38.640]   kinds. But what does Paul say that we're to do with people like this? If we come alongside
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.000]   someone that we care about that's engaging in unruly behavior, what are we supposed to
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:52.440]   do? What does he say? What's that command there? Yeah, that's right. Admonish. And you
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:54:00.520]   know what? All that means is to warn. That's all that means. To warn them with the idea
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:05.760]   that we need to show them the consequence of their sinful conduct. That's why you warn
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:10.000]   them, because you want to bring that to light. Not in front of your friends or in front of
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:18.440]   people. You do it in private. But that's the whole idea. Practically speaking, though,
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:24.320]   before I would ever admonish anybody, I wouldn't just, you know, run over to admonish a person.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:30.920]   I always take time to pray. I want to make sure that my motives are correct. I look at
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:34.560]   the big old log in my eye before I look at the speck in my brother's eye or my sister's
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:39.920]   eye. And I think through how I'm going to do it. You always want to do it in private,
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:47.520]   of course. But, you know, the whole goal of admonishment is restoration. It's not to condemn
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:53.720]   people. You get me on that one? They're off track with Christ. It's about Christ and their
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:59.080]   relationship with Christ. And so the whole idea is to try to come alongside and admonish
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:05.480]   them and to warn them that they are going to go down a road that is not good. But we
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:09.800]   do this when there's a pattern of sin like that. And that woman that I was telling you
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:16.120]   about that was engaging in drunkenness, she was somebody that I needed to talk to in private.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.240]   And I just simply told her out of love for her, you are at a step with Christ and the
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:24.400]   rest of God's people. You're turning to a false God. And this is not, this is going
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:29.600]   to end in disaster. Just think of the consequences that she's going to reap if she doesn't repent
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:34.520]   of this behavior. She's going to lose her marriage. She's going to, she's going to probably
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:41.000]   lose her job. And so, so many things. A good proverb that you can share with someone that's
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:47.840]   being unruly is Proverbs 13, 15, which says that good sense wins favor, but the way of
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:54.840]   a transgressor is hard, you know. And that was kind of my admonishment to her that it's
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:56:01.320]   not going to be, you're just thinking like in the present. You're not considering the
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:07.280]   consequences of your actions. But at a heart level, you know, a Christian who's being unruly,
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:11.200]   you can't just, you can't just think about the behavior on the outside. That would make
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:18.040]   us humanists. We got to really think about what's going on at the heart level. And essentially,
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:22.320]   you know, that's when we start asking deeper questions like what do they want that they're
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:27.960]   not getting? Why do they want to have, you know, it's usually a pride issue. You know,
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:33.720]   why are they seeking to take Jesus' rightful place on the throne of their hearts? And so
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:38.720]   those are some things to think about. But I even gave you like a definition of pride
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:43.760]   there that was from a booklet that one of my colleagues wrote. Because a lot of times
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:50.760]   unruly people struggle with particular issues of pride, and you can read that on your own.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:55.240]   Thankfully, that lady I was telling you about, she actually repented. And that was just such
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:00.880]   a joy to see that, that she was willing to lay aside her sin for the sake of Christ.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:06.960]   And Jesus is your perfect example of discipleship. You know, he admonished a lot of people in
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:12.360]   scripture. So you don't have to take my word for it or follow me. You just follow Christ
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:16.680]   because he admonished people when they were at a step. And I think I gave you some scripture
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:23.680]   verses. The next category are the faint-hearted. These are people that Paul says are literally
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:31.840]   small-souled. That's what that word means in the original language. Small-souled. These
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:37.040]   are women that are anxious. These are women that are timid. These are women that are just
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:44.040]   faint-hearted. You know, they fear everything. They fear the unknown. They are captive to
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:49.560]   worrying habitually. A lot of times they have a sense of inadequacy or maybe even a lack
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:54.720]   of confidence in their abilities. And they often lose heart. You know, they just kind
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:58:01.000]   of want to give up before they even get going. Do you know someone like that in your church?
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.640]   Are you someone like that in your church? It's a common one. There's no temptation
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:13.160]   common to man. This is a very common thing I see. And it was happening in the church
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:17.580]   in Thessalonica. Think about that. That was over how many years ago? And so you have women
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:20.920]   that were faint-hearted. Not women, just people that were faint-hearted in that church as
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:26.520]   well. They were kind of struggling because they really thought they had loved ones that
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:30.760]   had died. And they were struggling because they didn't know what was going to happen
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:34.800]   when Christ came back. What was going to happen to their loved ones that were buried? And
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:40.840]   so Paul had to encourage them with the truth and say, "You know what? When Christ returns,
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:45.520]   your loved ones who are already dead, they'll be raptured as well. So don't worry about
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:50.800]   that." But in the church today, I mean, women struggle with a lot of things. You know, probably
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:55.280]   the most common thing I see is women struggling in their marriages. They're faint-hearted.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:59.600]   They're losing heart. They need encouragement. How do I deal with a disobedient husband?
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:05.720]   Or how do I deal with an unbelieving husband? Or whatever. And that's where that comes in.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:11.100]   They're just discouraged because the circumstances might feel like it's beyond their control.
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:19.020]   And so we encourage them, you know. He says to encourage them. And that command is actually
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:23.640]   in the present tense imperative, meaning that if you're given a chance to counsel a faint-hearted
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:29.580]   woman or disciple someone like that, you are called to continually encourage them. It's
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:36.940]   a continuous act. And so you need to be observant. Be looking out there in your church and see
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:43.300]   if you have friends or women that might need some encouragement. Again, people are going
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:48.660]   through lots and lots of things and they need our encouragement. There's definitely more
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:52.140]   to be said about that. But I want to move on to helping the weak so we can kind of finish
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:56.660]   on time because I want you to work through those questions. But another category is just
[00:59:56.660 --> 01:00:02.900]   helping the weak. It's another group of women that you'll probably find in your church,
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:11.780]   no doubt. You know, the definition for weak here kind of means people, those without strength.
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:17.800]   Not physically, but more spiritually. And the first one that he's referring to really
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:22.500]   is a spiritually weak faith. And so those would be people that just kind of have a lack
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:29.300]   of knowledge of the will of God. Some through just a lack of courage to trust the Lord.
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:35.580]   Maybe they're facing persecution in their families or just from others. And it can also
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:40.020]   mean morally weak. You know, there are many people out there who just keep falling into
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:45.780]   the same sins over and over again. And so there are some women in your churches, unfortunately,
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:51.300]   that just get carried away by their emotion and they struggle with self-control and with
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:58.140]   their thought life. And in Thessalonica, Paul was kind of alluding to the weak being sexually,
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:05.180]   sexually tempted in chapter 4. But the command that we're given, I mean, we're not to run
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:09.500]   away from these people. You know, we recognize this is going on in their life and the command
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:14.900]   that we're given is to help them. But it has a much bigger meaning than what we think,
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:21.580]   you know, help. What Paul has in mind there is to give sympathetic assistance. You know,
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:27.020]   it's kind of that idea of supporting a weak person by keeping yourself directly over against
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:33.140]   the weak so you are sustaining them. And Paul talks about that actually in Galatians 6,
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:38.900]   1. You who are spiritual, if you're caught up in a trespass, you are to restore such
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:44.300]   a one. So you're picking these people up, you're bearing their burdens, and you're holding
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:49.940]   them up. And, you know, the church is just full of weak people. It's, you know, sometimes
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:54.700]   they're just new believers, they come out of hard lives, and there's just lots and lots
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:02:00.060]   of things that we can really encourage and help them in. But Jesus, who is the believer's
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:04.900]   perfect example of discipleship, really helped those who were weak. And you know what? Peter
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:09.940]   actually was an example of a weak believer in the beginning anyway, before Jesus was
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:15.660]   crucified. He was often very frail, he was often very half-hearted, but Jesus helped
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:22.380]   him to face his weaknesses. And, of course, we have learned lots from Peter. It's amazing
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:28.940]   how he had such full devotion at the end. And then the last thing that I want to point
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:36.060]   out in 1 Thessalonians is that Paul says that we need to be patient with all men. Okay?
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:41.300]   So that's a category of people, that's everyone else who does not fit into the first three
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:46.220]   categories but actually in those who do. So it's kind of a both/and. He's saying that
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:51.620]   all men, all women, need to be patient with people as God sanctifies them. And that's
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:56.580]   something you're going to run into because if you're really serious about making disciples,
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:01.420]   one thing that I've noticed, and I train counselors all the time too, one thing I notice, and
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:06.620]   maybe even Esther can confirm, sometimes when we come alongside people we want them to grow
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:13.460]   spiritually really fast on our own timing. Right? And we can't figure out why they aren't
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:19.780]   growing at the fast pace that we think they should. So we need to remember that God does
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:24.780]   the sanctifying. He's just using us as an instrument in his hand to get the word to
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:31.300]   them and to come alongside and encourage them, but he does the growing. And so God is asking
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:37.340]   us to have a steady patience with people that really expresses that long spiritedness and
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:42.620]   a slowness to anger, which of course is reflective of God's steady patience with us all the time.
