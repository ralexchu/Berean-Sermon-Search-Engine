[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you, God.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.200]   Lord, we truly do thank you for your blessing.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.360]   And I pray, God, that here tonight as we study your Word and try to dig deep, I pray, Father
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.800]   God, that we would as ones who truly love you, we would love the reading and the studying
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.200]   of your Word, and God, that we would seek to be changed, be impacted into our lives
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.000]   by the truth that you have in store for us.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.240]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.240]   Okay.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.920]   All right, I want to begin off by doing a little bit of review.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.280]   Okay?
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.180]   So a couple fill in the blanks for you guys.
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.960]   To say that we're doing an inductive study obviously isn't like some profound rocket
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.080]   science.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.420]   All we're talking about is three easy steps.
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.760]   The first one is?
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.680]   Observation.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.920]   And the second one is?
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.600]   Interpretation.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.000]   And the last one is?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.600]   Application.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.120]   Good.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.640]   Okay.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.640]   Observation, interpretation, and observation.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:26.100]   And obviously, after time, over time, as your skill improves on what sorts of things you
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.460]   should notice in the scriptures, and also as the breadth of your knowledge of scripture
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.180]   broadens, how to interpret various parts of scripture, and by practice, how to apply various
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.660]   parts of scripture, you're going to improve just year upon year.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.660]   Okay?
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:51.080]   As we talked about the Corinthians, the church at Corinth, we, let's see, oh, I asked you
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.640]   guys actually a couple questions.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.600]   After having read 1 Corinthians just in broad scope, how would you describe the church?
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.000]   In what ways are they healthy, and what deadly ailments do they suffer from?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.680]   Can I have some volunteers to answer that question?
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.240]   Yes, there's a list, there's a laundry list of things that they do wrong, but what are
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.080]   maybe some things that are actually healthy, and also let's list those things that are
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.720]   deadly ailments to the church.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.400]   How's about, I'm gonna call on a table.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.000]   Let's see.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   This table is really full.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.200]   Does anybody want to volunteer?
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   Great.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   Gotcha.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:51.600]   So, if you didn't hear what he said, the church was actually really kind of striving to practice
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.960]   their gifts.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.560]   The bad part was they were seeing their gifts as better than others, and they were competing
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   with each other.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   Okay?
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.200]   What are the things that you guys notice about the church?
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   Good things, bad things?
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.200]   Yes?
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   You could say they really worship God, if anything the problem was that their worship
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   services would get a little bit overboard.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.200]   Okay.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   If anything, we're so not the opposite, actually.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   It's so orderly.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   Right, right, right.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   Good, thank you.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.200]   So, if you guys didn't hear him, he says they're worshiping, and they're expressive, and you
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   know, but obviously the downside to that could have been that it was disorderly, and they
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   were going overboard and whatnot.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   So, he talks about that in 1 Corinthians.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   Good.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   Okay.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   Next question.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   How would you describe Paul's relationship to these believers?
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   How's about the other full table ladies, the sisters over there?
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.200]   Yeah, that one.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   Anybody from that table?
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   Uh-huh?
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   Great, okay.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   Very good.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   Straight from the notes, excellent.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   That's okay.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   As a spiritual father, I made the mention that Apostle Paul probably spent one of the
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   lengthier times at this church, over a year and a half, and he actually obviously wrote
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   multiple letters, but the church history believes that his interaction with them went way more
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   than the two letters that we have in the Bible, but that he was interacting with them.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   He obviously cared so much about them that he would hear reports about them, so he's
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   asking for people to report about them.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   He would even send other people to go there and minister to them.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   All around, Apostle Paul really loved this church.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.200]   All right?
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   Okay.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   Now, in thinking about that, here's some other questions by way of review.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   What is the demographics of this church?
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   Was it all Gentile church because it was in Corinth, in Greece?
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   Was it a predominantly Jewish church?
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:17.200]   Who remembers the demographics of this church?
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   There was a mixture.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   Okay, good.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   Obviously, because it is in Greece, and it's really close to a lot of traffic and whatnot,
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   there were a lot of the Gentile people, but because of Rome and a lot of these Jewish
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   sects running away from the persecution that was existent in Rome, there was a huge contingency
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   of Jewish people as well.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   Okay?
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   I said, "What can we compare the city, Corinth, to as compared to a city in our day?"
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.200]   Like Vegas.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   You guys remember that, but the other stuff?
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   I'm just kidding.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   Yes, I said the city of Corinth was compared to Vegas.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   If you think Vegas, yeah, it's a lot of gambling and stuff, but actually Vegas is the hub of
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   auto shows, technology shows, even cowboy conventions.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   Basically, just about any kind of business convention you can think of, they would have
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   these conventions.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   As a matter of fact, Bia, my wife, worked for a salami company, and they have conventions
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   for salami on Vegas.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   Weird, right?
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   Corinth was like that because it was in that ... Remember the geography picture I showed
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   you?
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   It was a channel that went right through, so a lot of commerce.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   But what's more, it was a derogatory term to be like, "Oh, you're a Corinth girl.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.200]   You're a Corinth boy," to say you're a pagan to the core.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.200]   Immorality, debauchery, you just lose lifestyle.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.200]   Okay?
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   So, the city of Corinth can be likened to, in modern day, Vegas.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   Okay?
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.200]   So to that church, I said, to a church that's in the midst of such, I guess, a mixture of
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:58.200]   things and an environment that's hostile to pure Christian faith, Apostle Paul writes
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.200]   a letter challenging the church to be pure from the worldly influence and effects.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   Last week, we talked about how Apostle Paul, warmly, in his introduction, so to speak,
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   of the letter, he laid the foundation of their salvation.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   And he was both thankful, he was praising God for them, and it's almost weird.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.200]   It was weird because we know what's contained in this letter, some of the harsher rebukes.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   But Apostle Paul was very fatherly with them.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   Well, today we begin with one of the first challenges and exhortations to this church,
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.200]   and that comes from verse 10 through 17 of chapter 1.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   So let's all turn there, 1 Corinthians chapter 1, verse 10 through 17, and then we'll take
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   it step by step in observing what the word has in store for us today.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   All right?
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   So, chapter 1, verse 10 through 17.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   Okay.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   So, it says, "Now, I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   the same mind and in the same judgment.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by Chloe's people that there are
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200]   no quarrels among you.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   Now, I mean this, that each one of you is saying, 'I am of Paul, and I am of Paulus,
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   and I am of Cephas, I of Christ.'
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   Has Christ been divided?
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   Paul was not crucified for you, was he?
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.200]   Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, so that no one would say
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   you were baptized in my name.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   Now, I did baptize also the household of Stephanas.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any other.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in cleverness of
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void."
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   Okay.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   So, we have this exhortation from Apostle Paul.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   And I want to begin by taking a look at the first verse, just the first phrase of it.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   "Now, I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you, when you
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   read this," as I just kind of, I tried to do like a dramatic reading of it, "how do
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   you hear his tone?"
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.200]   Okay.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   "What kind of tone do you think he's using?"
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   And yes, someone please volunteer and answer this one.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   I know it's kind of an obvious one.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   He's saying like, "I exhort you," right?
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   "What kind of tone do you think he's using?"
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   I asked the question because when I did my like reading through, I thought, yeah, he's
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   setting them up.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   He says, "I'm so thankful for you, and I'm sure of your basically salvation, and then
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   now, I exhort you," right?
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   So, I almost felt like he did like a, "Hey, guys, this is my letter to you, and now I'm
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.200]   going to lay this smack down," you know, almost like a setup, and then, well, bam, it's coming
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   down hard.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.200]   But I'm questioning that, and I wonder if that's the case.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.200]   That's how I read it the first time through.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   And I remember last week when I was kind of talking about it with you guys, I even used
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   this tone in my own reading, with my own voice, like, "And now, I'm going to tell you how
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.200]   it is," right?
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:40.200]   "What kind of tone do you think he's using?"
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   "He's pleading."
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.200]   Thank you.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.200]   That's great that you observed that because one of the practices you guys want to do is
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   compare different translations.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   If you're working off the ESV, how many of you guys are working off the ESV?
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   It uses the word what?
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   Appeal.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   If you're working off the NASB or the King James Version, it'll use the word exhort.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.200]   And that's because that one verb, depending on context, is sometimes used differently.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:12.200]   But what I find is that, although I read it harshly, given that he began with such warm
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   words of, like, "Grace and peace to you," and then, given that he's calling them brethren,
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   and given that he's using this word that typically, yes, does mean to try to at least plead with
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   somebody, I wonder, again, how his tone is.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   And so, I realize, depending sometimes, we do this, on your personality, you read stuff
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   in your voice.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   Sometimes if you're goofy and stuff, and you're looking for silly things, I read sometimes
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   the Bible in an accent.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   Weird, right?
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   And other times, if you're the type where you're confrontational, perhaps you're reading
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.200]   it like, "And now, you better listen up."
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:55.200]   But actually, Apostle Paul, I believe, is using a word where the word appeal is the
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   Greek word, parakaleo.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   And the reason why I remember this is because the word for the Holy Spirit, when he's our
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   helper, the paraklete, when I was in Samaria, I remembered it, memorized it by saying the
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   parakeet, is the paraklete, he's the helper.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   He's the one who come alongside you and helps you.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   So you see Apostle Paul's choice of words, because there are other words he could have
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   chosen, and you realize his tone has a nice balance.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.200]   Where it's authoritative, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   But it also is loving and pleading with them.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.200]   I think that's something to note here.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:42.200]   That from the very, I guess, the first exhortation that he has, it's not just a harsh, confrontational
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   rebuke, but there is a balance where he mitigates the harshness.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   Yet still maintains the authority.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.200]   Good balance that he has.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   Okay?
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:57.200]   So, Paul harmonizes both the authority and compassion.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   Because he wants to help.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.200]   He's seeking their benefit whenever he speaks.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.200]   Okay?
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   So he harmonizes the authority and the compassion.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.200]   And now you guys will always remember the parakeet.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.200]   Alright.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   Number two.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.200]   Looking at the second part of verse 10, he says, "Now exhort your brethren by the name
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.200]   of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree, and that there be no divisions among you.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   But that you be made complete in the same mind, and in the same judgment."
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.200]   I asked you guys if you guys had the time to look at this passage.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.200]   How would you describe the command that he's giving?
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.200]   I know I have two blanks.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.200]   Let's do the obvious.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.200]   So what does he say?
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   What's the command?
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   Agree and no division.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.200]   Okay?
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.200]   So basically he's saying the same thing in two different ways.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   One positive, one negative.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   Which Paul does quite often.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   Okay?
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   So agree and have no division.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   Okay?
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   But I ask you this question.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.200]   You know, like, as you guys read the passage, throw out a guess.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   Throw out a, you know, hypothesis, so to speak.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   What do you think he means by, "I want you to just agree"?
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   What's the command there?
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.200]   All right.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.200]   How about this?
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:45.200]   To make it kind of more specific, let's just take the plain meaning of agree.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.200]   Two people, when they agree, they agree.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   Okay?
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.200]   They line up.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:55.200]   Now, question to you is, as Apostle Paul is challenging this church to agree,
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.200]   what sort of things do you think he wants them to agree upon?
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   Okay?
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.200]   What sort of things do you think he wants them to agree upon?
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   Okay, you can throw out any hypothesis, guess.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   Don't be afraid.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   Okay, great.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   So if you didn't hear, she said, "Perhaps they should agree about who to follow
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   because they're obviously disagreeing about -- no, probably maybe they're thinking,
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   like, 'No, see if this is better.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   He's the better preacher.'"
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.200]   And maybe the other guy is saying, "No, Apostle Paul is, like, the better leader
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   through experience.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.200]   He's gone through suffering."
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   And the other guy is like, "No, we just need Jesus."
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   You know?
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.200]   So anyway, maybe they're just disagreeing about leaders, and he's saying,
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.200]   "You guys need to agree about leaders."
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:47.200]   That's a great observation that, in the context, that's maybe what it seems.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:53.200]   But what else do you think that he expects this church to agree upon?
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   Okay, great.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   Who Christ was.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.200]   Okay?
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.200]   Let me ask you real quick, Andy.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   Did you say that because of something you observed in the passage,
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.200]   or did you say that maybe, like, just in other passages in general,
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.200]   they should agree on who Christ is?
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   [inaudible]
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   Right.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   [inaudible]
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   Good.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   [inaudible]
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   Right.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   Great.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   So I think that's a good observation, too.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   And absolutely, if we think about it in general,
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   the Christian church should absolutely agree,
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   the members of a church, local congregation,
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   should agree about the person of Christ, who he is.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   And the reason why I keep saying, "Oh, that was a good observation,"
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   is because, remember, so far for me, as I read the first passage,
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   I always try to do one of these tallies of what's the most repeated concept.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   And still, the most repeated concept is Jesus.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   He's exhorting them in the name of Jesus.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.200]   He's repeating the person of Jesus.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   And I've read that verses 1 through 9 or 1 through 8,
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   the name of Jesus appeared many, many, many, many times.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   Okay?
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   So good.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   Yes.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:27.200]   [inaudible]
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   Excellent. Okay.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   That's -- I think that's -- if you guys didn't hear what he said,
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   I said, "Because later in context of this book,
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.200]   there's much talk about immorality.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   There's much talk about fornification and all sorts of things.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.200]   Determining, evaluating, and judging what is evil, what is right and wrong,
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.200]   that judgment also needs to be agreed upon."
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   And actually, if you think about this, take a look at the goal here.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.200]   So I wrote in your packet, look at 10C.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   He says, "I want you all to agree and that there be no divisions among you,
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment."
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:16.200]   So if you are in your packet, it says, "What is the goal of Paul --
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.200]   what is the goal that Paul is seeking?
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   Made complete in same mind and judgment."
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.200]   Okay.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   So that starts to tell us Paul expected this church to definitely agree upon
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:35.200]   judging, evaluating what is valuable, what is right, what is wrong,
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   what is sinful, what is holy, what is pure.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.200]   Okay.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   But, you know, if we think a little broader about this,
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   if you turn your Bibles over to Philippians 3, verse 15 through 17.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   Go in your Bibles to Philippians.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   Philippians 3, verse 15 through 17.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:11.200]   He says this, "Let us, therefore, as many are perfect, have this attitude."
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.200]   And in ESV, what does it say for the word "attitude"?
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.200]   Does it just say "attitude" as well?
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   What does it say?
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   Philippians 3, verse 15.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.200]   So, "Let us, therefore, as many are perfect, have this same --
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   think this way."
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.200]   Okay, yeah.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   Can you read that first portion for me?
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   Okay.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   So it's kind of pretty different, right?
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   One is, "Let us have this attitude, otherwise think this way."
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.200]   And then I'm just going to keep going.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.200]   It says, "And if in anything you have a different attitude,
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.200]   God will reveal that also to you.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.200]   However, let us keep living by the same standard to which we have attained.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.200]   Brethren, join in following my example.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.200]   Observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us."
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.200]   And then he's going to keep going.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:09.200]   This passage in Philippians, it doesn't limit what you're supposed to agree upon,
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.200]   just the doctrine does it.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.200]   It doesn't limit what you're supposed to agree upon just in terms of leadership,
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.200]   does it?
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.200]   As a matter of fact, he says, "By way of attitude, by way of thinking,
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.200]   I want you guys to agree.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.200]   By way of pattern of living, I want you guys to agree.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.200]   I want you to be in accord."
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.200]   And this is a huge theme in the Bible, that there be no disagreement in the
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.200]   church even to that kind of specific realm of living.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.200]   There's a passage -- I'm kind of jumping around a little bit,
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.200]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.200]   In Romans 16, verse 17, which I have in your packet,
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   "Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause dissensions and
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.200]   hinders, and contrary to the teaching which you learned and turned away from."
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   So, yes, Apostle Paul wants us to be united in doctrine and teaching,
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   but it's much broader than that.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.200]   So I ask you this question, okay?
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.200]   I ask you this question.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.200]   Is there room for disagreement in the church?
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.200]   Right now, if you guys kind of get the flow of what I'm saying,
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   I'm actually making the point that even to very specific things,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.200]   how we think, how we judge, how we evaluate, how we live,
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.200]   there's a sense in which we need to agree, okay?
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.200]   So it's much broader.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:37.200]   In a culture, especially like ours, where we highly value diversity,
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   which the Christian church does too,
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:45.200]   there might be something of a kind of perspective that is at odds,
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.200]   an ideology that is at odds,
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   when you think about how much Apostle Paul desires there to be unity and
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   one accord as opposed to how much diversity.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.200]   So I throw this question out to you guys.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   To what degree can members in a church,
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.200]   let's say Berlin Community Church, can we have disagreements?
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   Are we allowed to have disagreements about stuff?
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   Is it okay for members to be members when they disagree about various things?
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   What are we allowed to disagree about?
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:23.200]   Any ideas or thoughts about that?
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   Yes.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.200]   Okay.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.200]   All right, so she said things that aren't explicit in the Bible,
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.200]   obviously they're different, like if it's kind of a gray area that's not spelled out in Scripture,
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.200]   there's different approaches, different applications probably.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.200]   Okay.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.200]   What else?
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   Yes.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   [inaudible]
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:18.200]   So do we disagree in the sense of having different views or do we disagree in the sense of I think they're wrong?
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   Interesting.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.200]   Okay.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.200]   Did you guys hear that?
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   All right.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.200]   I'm not going to repeat it, but that's actually, I mean,
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   I think that's really wise to discern what we mean by disagree.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   Just for the sake of kind of, let's do this.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   Let's just take the more extreme view of that term disagree to make the case.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   Okay.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   So amongst just saying, oh, I have a certain perspective, I'm applying,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   and then the other person is applying and all that stuff,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:56.200]   whereas the extreme is you actually think this should be the standard and you're wrong for not doing the standard.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   Okay.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.200]   So for the sake of argument, let's just say it's the more extreme of the two.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:11.200]   What's really interesting is the scriptures highly, highly value unity to a degree that which if it's at all possible,
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   keep pursuing agreement.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.200]   Does that make sense?
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.200]   Keep pursuing the agreement.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   And so there are passages in the scripture that talk about and command us basically in as much as it is possible with you,
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   be in one accord.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:33.200]   And furthermore, as you guys know, the scriptures talk about for the sake of the body of Christ in unity,
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.200]   you need to also combine together to obey the leadership.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   So what I mean by that is it's one thing for, let's say, different pieces of the community to say, hey,
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   we just need to come to a middle ground, compromise and agree.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   Or you can say, look, there's one standard and we all need to agree to that standard.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   And by agreeing to one standard, we're naturally in agreement.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.200]   I would say the Bible is more for the side of seeing that.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:05.200]   Where the leadership of the church is entrusted with teaching, with directing, with vision casting,
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.200]   and applying the scriptures in the local body context.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   And the members of the church need to in as much as they can in their own study of the scripture, yes,
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.200]   but follow suit with that.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.200]   So if you look at some of these passages, Hebrews chapter 13 verse 17,
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:25.200]   pray your leaders and submit to them for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   Let them do this with joy and not with grief for this would be unprofitable for you.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:37.200]   Another passage, Acts 4 32, the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   I'm going to read another passage, Philippians 2 verse 2 and following.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love,
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   if there is any fellowship of the spirit, any affection and compassion,
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.200]   make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love,
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   united in spirit, intent on one purpose.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:00.200]   Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind,
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.200]   regard one another as more important than yourselves.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.200]   Do not merely look out for your own personal interest, but also for the interest of others.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   Okay.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   Now, as I'm reading this passage, this is what I'm hoping to kind of make the point of.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:22.200]   You see, when it comes to the local church, our local body of believers,
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   I believe we are to seek and continue seeking greater and greater agreement.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   The world might look at that and be like, ha, bunch of drones, bunch of sheep.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:37.200]   You guys are just listening to one concept, one perspective, and you guys are all the same.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   But in my mind, just because we're all in unison about philosophy of ministry, about conviction,
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.200]   how do we choose leaders?
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   What do we expect from members?
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.200]   That doesn't mean we're drones or sheep.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:56.200]   If we do the due diligence of studying the scriptures and applying and having our own conviction.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:01.200]   But actually, I think it's a beautiful thing that the Lord desires when the church is harmonious,
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.200]   even to that degree.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.200]   And I'm going to say this.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.200]   Practically speaking, if there is a member at our church who says,
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.200]   yeah, I know the church is all about membership, but I think it's just whatever.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.200]   I'm going to sign it, but I disagree.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:18.200]   Or if the church says, yeah, I know the church has a vision for this, but for me, I have a different vision.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.200]   Or if they disagree with how we place leadership, let me use that as an example.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.200]   Even a disagreement about who is in leadership.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:31.200]   If you see that individual who you don't think should be a leader, and they're on top of the stage,
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:37.200]   or they're preaching and teaching, it's hard to be a happy participant in the local body.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.200]   Right?
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.200]   So, that is why I don't necessarily speak on behalf of all the elders,
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.200]   but I know that they generally agree with this.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   If an individual comes to us and says, yeah, I don't agree with you guys about even something,
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.200]   let's say infant baptism, okay?
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.200]   Highly debated topic in the Christian circle.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   And says, I don't agree about that whole issue with you guys.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.200]   We're okay with saying we're not going to try to make you stay here.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.200]   If you're convicted about that, maybe you need to go.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   They're like, whoa, I never thought about that.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:19.200]   Because there are certain issues that the church leadership has said, this we have a conviction about.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   Like Hannah said, there are things that are, again, not clearly explicit in the Bible,
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:28.200]   and there are things that the leadership says, this is clear in the Bible, and this is our stance.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.200]   If the church has come out and said those type of things, the congregation needs to agree.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:38.200]   They need to come together in unison and be in one accord with that, right?
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.200]   And if a member disagrees with the things that the church sees as vital,
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.200]   even if it's not, let's say, explicit in the Bible, but they see it important enough,
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.200]   that it's a part of church policy, church philosophy, church ministry,
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.200]   then the members of the church need to agree, okay?
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.200]   All right.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   So, the goal that he has in mind is same mind, same judgment, broadly speaking,
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:10.200]   what they believe, how they decide, standards, attitudes, and even principles of living.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.200]   Pretty specific, huh?
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   I just wanted to make this case because I do believe it is kind of contrary to current kind of ideologies.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   I think it's kind of contrary, like, oh, it's a beautiful thing that you have all these people
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.200]   of different beliefs just trying to come together.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:31.200]   Actually, our perspective is it's a beautiful thing when there is true harmony
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.200]   based on each individual through their conviction of the word,
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:40.200]   having the result of being in one accord of mind and spirit, that is a beautiful thing.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   Okay?
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.200]   Yes.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:56.200]   [inaudible]
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   Right.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:23.200]   [inaudible]
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.200]   Right, right, right.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   So, he poses a good question, you know, like, there's kind of a line where you draw,
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   and I'm going to say two things.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.200]   One, there is a line that you draw based upon context.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:41.200]   So, on your packet I wrote universal church, ministries, and local church, okay?
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.200]   The universal church at large is every single Christian in the world.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.200]   There is great diversity, great diversity.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:51.200]   And I don't think anybody is going to draw strict lines, like you meet another Christian on the street,
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   and you're like, you and I need to agree, brother, and you just start hashing things out.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.200]   But also in different ministries, ministry to ministry, there's great differences as well.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.200]   The kind of unity that I just mentioned that needs to be really pursued
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   is what I was talking about in the local church.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   So, that's one.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   Okay, so the line that you draw, they're first based upon what context.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:17.200]   But also the line that you draw, again, is there is great precedence and weight
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.200]   and responsibility on the leadership of the church.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.200]   There are certain times you cannot draw a line
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:28.200]   because God never gave us that kind of sharp tool from the scripture.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:32.200]   And sometimes he doesn't give us a broad stroke and says, "This is how it is."
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.200]   And the leadership of the church has to be aware of that.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.200]   And so, I found it pretty amazing.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.200]   There's one sense in which we can disobey the Bible
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   where you go against explicit things in the scripture.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.200]   But also, just as worse of a sin was presumptuousness in the Bible
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.200]   where you go above the scripture
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.200]   and you start making rules like the same,
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.200]   like applications the same weight as biblical principle.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.200]   And that's where the church just needs to exercise great wisdom.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   So, I hope that helps.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.200]   Okay.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.200]   Okay, so that's the first section, right?
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.200]   Apostle Paul's exhortation.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.200]   He says, "You guys need to agree.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.200]   "You guys need to be of the same mind and of the same judgment."
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   And I want to just expound, again, the goal that he has in mind is
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   he wants them to be complete.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   The word for complete is kind of a medical term.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.200]   When things are broken, like let's say you have a shattered bone
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   and you bring those things together, that's the word he uses for complete.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.200]   So, he desires that church, the local body in Corinth,
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.200]   to be complete together.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   And as he's doing that, he's going to start examining,
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   like a good doctor would, what is at the core of their problem.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.200]   Okay?
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.200]   So, I ask you this question.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   What is the core problem that Apostle Paul is addressing
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.200]   in these verses that we're studying today?
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:33:01.200]   What do you think is the core problem here?
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:12.200]   Yes.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:36.200]   [inaudible]
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.200]   Okay. Yeah.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.200]   Okay.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   So, perhaps they're weak in theology and doctrine.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.200]   They're easily influenced as like maybe, you know,
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.200]   different teachers have come and all that kind of stuff.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.200]   Okay.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.200]   What else?
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.200]   Yes.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:09.200]   [inaudible]
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   Okay.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.200]   Okay.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:18.200]   So, both by culture and both by what they expect and stuff like that,
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.200]   there could be difference between the Gentiles and the Jews.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.200]   All right?
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   Reasons for division?
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.200]   Yes.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.200]   [inaudible]
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.200]   Okay.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   [inaudible]
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   All right.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.200]   Okay, okay.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   Good, good.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.200]   All right.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   So, if you guys are taking notes, jot some of these ideas down.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.200]   I mean, these are all good observations.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.200]   Potentially, I mean, I think this is one that I think we need to
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.200]   spend some time on is Jesus Christ was not a priority.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   Like, they were looking to different leaders.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:03.200]   And so, this kind of like the kind of actually mental flow that I took to is
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.200]   for when I was reading, it's like, okay, so there's a report.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   Hey, the people are fighting, you know.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:14.200]   And then I wondered, pastoral loyalty, you know, like, so what ends up
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   happening is when people say, oh, I'm a Paul, you know, Apostle Paul,
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.200]   again, he planted the church.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   He spent a year and a half there.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   Of course.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:27.200]   I mean, like, you guys, you know, I have no shame in talking about it.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   I see Pastor Peter as a spiritual father, and he's ministered to me for the
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   last, like, 15, 16 years.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   And it's crazy because I just realized the other day, I'm the age that he was
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   when he first met me when I was in college.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   It's kind of weird, yeah.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:45.200]   And so, literally, for like a generation of time, he's been like my mentor.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.200]   And do I have an affection for him?
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   Absolutely.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   If someone were to ask me, like, are you loyal to him?
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.200]   Yeah, I am.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   And so, you can imagine that kind of stuff happening.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.200]   Apollos was actually the second pastor.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.200]   So, when Apostle Paul left for his second journey, he sent Apollos over there to
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.200]   minister to that church.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   Peter's ministry, you know, Andy mentioned that there were these Jews.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.200]   Peter was apostle to the Jews, okay, remember?
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.200]   In the Book of Acts, Chapter 5, Apostle Peter is the one ministering to the
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   Jews, and many were converted under his teaching.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   So, he mentions Cephas, that's Apostle Peter.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   So, you have people who are loyal to Peter.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   And then, I'm sure there are people who, you know, like, hey, I need no human
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.200]   leader above me, I'm all about Jesus, you know.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.200]   And so, they're saying, I don't need all these people, I'm just committed to
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   Jesus and whatnot.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   So, is that what's happening?
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   And I think there's a sense in which what Karen said, and what you guys said is
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.200]   all true in the sense that they're theologically weak and they're being
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   swayed, there's cultural differences.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.200]   But there's also this idea, where's the priority of Christ in this, right?
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   Now, the other thing that I wanted to mention too, though, is trying to think
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.200]   about why are they fighting in this way, you know.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:02.200]   Like, we, at our church, we have a senior pastor, but we're in a context where we
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.200]   also have heroes of the faith.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.200]   Where some of us, if you guys, you know, really, if you guys went to UCLA, you
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.200]   want a grace on campus, you love MacArthur, you know.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.200]   If you love John Piper's ministry, you love Piper.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.200]   You love Keller, you love Keller, you know.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.200]   And sometimes people have disagreements about who they enjoy.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.200]   I personally like Alistair Begg, you know.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.200]   And they have all these disagreements about who's your kind of hero in the
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   faith and who's your favorite preacher and all that kind of stuff.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.200]   But we wouldn't fight each other.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.200]   Why would they go to the degree of fighting each other?
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   Well, some of the commentaries ask this question of, in their identifying with
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   leadership, okay, identifying with leadership, the way that it reads in this
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.200]   Greek is like, I am of this person.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.200]   I am of that person, okay.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.200]   And if you notice, Paul talks about being baptized, and then when you're
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.200]   baptized, you're baptized in someone's name, okay.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   So by identifying and associating with the leadership, they're saying I have
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   that kind of authority or that kind of clout.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.200]   Does that make sense?
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.200]   So what's happening here?
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:07.200]   By identifying with certain individuals, they are seeing themselves as what?
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.200]   More holy, more righteous.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.200]   What are they doing when they say, hey, I'm of a Paulist?
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.200]   No, I'm of a Paulist.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:19.200]   What they're doing is trying to one-up each other, okay.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.200]   So the greatest sin of losing sight of Christ's priority is when you place
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   yourself as priority.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.200]   An argument I'm going to make is, these individuals were just haughty men
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.200]   theologically one-upping each other, having the arrogance, having the
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:41.200]   arrogance to say I'm better than you because I was under him, okay.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   Let me prove this to you.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.200]   Take your Bibles and we're going to do a little flip through.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:52.200]   First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 3, okay.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   Actually, as a matter of fact, if you guys look at chapter 1 verse 29, he
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   talks about how you guys are all weak, and God chose the weak, why?
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.200]   So that no man may boast before God.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   Look at chapter 3 verse 3.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and are
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.200]   you not walking like men?
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.200]   Take a look at chapter 4 verse 6.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.200]   For I am conscious of nothing against myself.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   Oh, sorry, sorry.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.200]   Chapter 4 verse 6.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.200]   Oh, here we go.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.200]   Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and a
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.200]   Paulist for your sake so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.200]   written.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:33.200]   So that no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one against
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.200]   another.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.200]   Look at chapter 4 verse 18.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   Now some have become arrogant as though I were not coming to you.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   Verse 19.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   But I will come to you soon if the Lord wills and I shall find out not the
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.200]   words of those who are arrogant but their power.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   Take a look at chapter 5 verse 2.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.200]   It says you have become arrogant and have mourned instead so that the one who
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.200]   had done this deed would be removed from your midst.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   And we can just keep going on.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.200]   You see what a major problem in the church has been, right?
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.200]   A huge problem in the church is the arrogance of man where they take
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:13.200]   something good, the loyalty to a pastor, the appreciation for a man who
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.200]   sacrificed greatly.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.200]   They take something good.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.200]   God has blessed the church with awesome leaders.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.200]   They take something good and they turn that into exclusivity.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.200]   They turn that into now I'm better than you.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.200]   Now I know and you don't.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   I bet you those people who said I'm of Jesus, I am of Christ alone, I bet you
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.200]   they were the most arrogant.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   I don't need a man.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:37.200]   You guys look at a pastor, you guys look at Paul, I don't even need him.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   And they make a claim to Jesus Christ not as a reason to be humbled.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:46.200]   They make it a reason to be arrogant and prideful.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:51.200]   That's one of the big or huge issues in the church that's hard to address but
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.200]   exists all over, isn't it?
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:59.200]   James in James chapter 4 verse 1 through 2 says this, "What is the source of
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.200]   quarrels and conflicts among you?
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.200]   It is not the source of your pleasures that wage war in your members.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.200]   You lust and you do not have so you commit murder.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.200]   You are envious and cannot obtain so you fight and quarrel.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.200]   You do not have because you do not ask.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:17.200]   You ask and do not receive because you ask with wrong motives so that you may
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   spend it on your pleasures."
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:28.200]   So the problem, yes, is individuals trying to identify with specific leaders.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   But we can tell their motivation from what Apostle Paul is saying.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.200]   They're becoming arrogant with each other.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.200]   The flesh breeds this kind of arrogance.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   The only way for us to have unity is for us to humble ourselves, for us to say,
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:49.200]   "I'm not going to specifically get my preference and what I want but rather I'm
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:55.200]   going to be empty of this kind of conceit and I'm going to seek the goodwill,
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.200]   the benefit of the people around me."
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.200]   That's how we obtain to unity.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.200]   True spirituality is humility.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.200]   Sin in the flesh is pride.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.200]   Okay?
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:12.200]   So I think about that a little bit and really I want to ask, like, you know,
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.200]   and this is maybe for application later.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:20.200]   Are there elements of this same kind of pride in our modern day?
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.200]   You know, I think there is.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   If you sit there and you're always name dropping like, "I met this guy,
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.200]   I met that guy."
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.200]   If you sit there and you're always talking about this.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.200]   You know, I love the Master's Seminary.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.200]   I had such a great time there.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.200]   My love for Christ deepened there.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.200]   But I did see some things that were pretty arrogant, you know?
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.200]   People who were like MacArthur only.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.200]   Everybody else who's not a MacArthurite is like, "Just weak sauce."
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.200]   You know?
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   And then there are guys who are like, "I met MacArthur."
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.200]   You know?
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.200]   I shook his hand.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.200]   I'm like, "What the --"
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.200]   He's not like the Holy Spirit.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.200]   His hand's all wrinkly and old.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.200]   He's really old now, by the way.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.200]   So what if he touched his hand, you know?
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.200]   But you know how it is.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   If he is your hero, that's fine.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.200]   Like he's somebody who you look up to.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.200]   That's great.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   But when by name dropping, by association, you start thinking of yourself better,
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.200]   that's absolute pride.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   And that's the heart of who we are sometimes.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.200]   We want to associate.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   We want to be linked to the greatest and the best.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.200]   So we wear shirts that say Harvard.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.200]   I don't know if anybody went to Harvard here.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.200]   I'm sorry if I'm offending you.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.200]   But stuff like that, you know?
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.200]   We want to be linked to the greatest and the best.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.200]   And I can see why these guys, in that time, when they --
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:42.200]   the culture of, you know, like they're close to Athens, they're in Greece,
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.200]   they mention their mentors, they mention the philosophers.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   I studied under that guy.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   I studied under this guy.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.200]   And that's their accolades.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.200]   So they're sitting there like, "I'm a Paulist.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.200]   Who are you of, you know?
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.200]   Who'd you learn under?"
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.200]   I can see why that happens.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.200]   And I bring all that up because you can see how that could happen potentially
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.200]   in our modern day too, right?
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   Pride, arrogance, and pride and self-righteousness by way of association,
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.200]   it can happen in our day, and we need to be careful.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:16.200]   So Apostle Paul, like a good father and also a good doctor,
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.200]   is going to apply some medicine.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.200]   Let's take a look at Verse 13 through 17.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:28.200]   13 through 17.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:34.200]   He says, "Has Christ been divided?
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.200]   Paul was not crucified for you, was he?
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.200]   Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.200]   I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:48.200]   so that no one would say you were baptized in my name.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.200]   Now I did baptize also the household of Stephanas.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.200]   Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any other.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel,
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.200]   not in cleverness of speech,
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:05.200]   so that the cross of Christ would not be made void."
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:11.200]   That whole section, Verse 13 through 17, is Apostle Paul reasoning.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:21.200]   I want to ask, what do you see as his strategy in addressing division and fighting?
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.200]   Do you see maybe one big punch, like, "This is where it's at, guys, boom!"
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   Do you see a little jab, jab, jab, jab, jab of little thingies?
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.200]   He's asking all these questions.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.200]   What's his strategy here, and what point is he getting at?
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:55.200]   [silence]
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.200]   How is he making his argument?
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   How is he going to make them understand?
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:06.200]   Yes.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.200]   Excellent.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.200]   All right.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.200]   Good Sunday school answer is always the best, Jesus.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.200]   [laughs]
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:19.200]   But to make it more specific, you know, Karen earlier said,
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.200]   "There is a priority of Christ that in the perspective of every man
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.200]   needs to exist in order for the world to be right."
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.200]   I always believed that.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.200]   When there is a whole lot of pain in your life and you can't make sense of things,
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:35.200]   perhaps the priorities have been mixed and jumbled by your difficult circumstance.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.200]   Sometimes you feel like you've lost sight of why you're doing what you're doing.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:42.200]   Probably the priorities of what you're investing your time and energy into
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:48.200]   is starting to be in question and suspect now is, where is your priority?
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.200]   By individuals starting to level up and try to put themselves above
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.200]   and advance over others, where is your priority?
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.200]   So Apostle Paul says through this weird argumentation of,
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.200]   "I'm so glad I didn't baptize. I'm so glad I didn't baptize these people.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   I'm going to baptize more people."
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:09.200]   He is making this argument, "My priority in the whole time that I was doing this
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:17.200]   was Christ and the cross of Christ and the gospel message of Jesus Christ preached.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.200]   How do we make sense of this?"
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.200]   It's the same way.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.200]   It's kind of like asking, "What are you building?"
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.200]   Our church leaders have been saying this from the day one that this church existed.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.200]   "What are we building?"
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.200]   If we want to one-up our church above another church, we've lost sight of Christ.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.200]   "What are we building?"
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.200]   If I want to build my pastoral ministry where now I want to be a PhD,
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:46.200]   a book-writing pastor with a huge flock, what am I building?
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:52.200]   If I'm gathering attention to myself, where is my priority?
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:57.200]   We're not gathering the flocks to Berean because Berean is awesome.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.200]   We're gathering to Berean to hear the gospel and to be edified through the gospel,
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:04.200]   to be edified in the truth of Christ.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   Ultimate priorities need to always be set, revisited, reestablished, examined,
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.200]   and that's what he's doing.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   That's why it makes sense that he would say,
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.200]   "I'm glad I didn't baptize a whole mess of you guys
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   because if I did, you would think you were baptized in my name
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.200]   and we would start a cult, a Paul cult.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.200]   But I'm so glad that didn't happen
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:34.200]   because I want you to be absolutely clear my priority was to preach the gospel."
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   And I think for us as we think about this, we have to reassess too
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:47.200]   that question of what are we trying to build, what is our priority?
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:53.200]   A lot of times the answer to some of the spiritual questions that we have,
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.200]   "How do you encourage a guy who is being arrogant and prideful?
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:01.200]   Do I go up and beat him up so he knows he's weaker than me?"
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   That's kind of like the crane of the brethren.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.200]   It's like, "Oh, I think you're all good, huh?"
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.200]   And then you go over and you pound him down and now you know your place.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.200]   Was that the answer?
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.200]   Paul's apologist gets their perspective straight.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.200]   And oftentimes that's what we need spiritually.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.200]   We don't necessarily need to get beaten down into the right position.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.200]   We need our perspectives and priorities straight.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:28.200]   And so that whole section as he starts to ask this question,
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:34.200]   he is centering his attention on Jesus Christ and he says, "Who am I?
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.200]   Was I crucified for you?
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:44.200]   Was I trying to get you to be my disciple so that we can have a nice cult?"
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   He says, "No, my priority was Jesus."
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:53.200]   And so we come at this last point of verse 17 that we need to focus on too.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   "For Christ did not send me to be baptized but to preach the gospel,
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   not in cleverness of speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void."
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.200]   Okay?
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   I love Apostle Paul because he truly is a guy who has his priorities
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:12.200]   and he's always seeing eternal perspective, huge vision.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   What's the goal, you know?
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:19.200]   He wants the church complete in Christ, sanctified, presented as a mature man,
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   presented as a pure body.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.200]   He's always thinking ultimate vision, huge goals, right?
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:30.200]   He says here one of the things he wants to make sure that he doesn't do ultimately
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.200]   is to work and labor and do all this stuff, build a church, plant a church,
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.200]   but then the cross of Christ to be made void.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:40.200]   I ask this question to you guys as a wrap up.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:47.200]   What would make the cross void in ministry?
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:51.200]   Maybe take a look at the verse again and try to make sense of what he's saying.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.200]   He's saying, "I'm so glad I didn't baptize.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:58.200]   This was my priority, and I made sure not to do certain things
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   so that the cross would not be made void."
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:17.200]   Any ideas or thoughts about that?
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.200]   What would cause, you know, after toiling and trying to build a church
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.200]   and ministering to people, what would cause, you know,
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:36.200]   the cross of Christ to be void in the midst of that ministry?
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:41.200]   The elevation of self, okay?
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.200]   [Laughter]
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.200]   Sorry.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.200]   Okay.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.200]   Was that a --
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:54.200]   [Inaudible]
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   Good.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.200]   Okay.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   Good, good.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.200]   Any other thoughts?
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.200]   Great answer.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:12.200]   I think we should take moments to think about that, you know,
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:18.200]   as we think about what Alex suggested a moment ago.
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:25.200]   When an individual or a church makes it its ambition simply to become successful.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:29.200]   When a church desires to draw people to the church so that the church can succeed.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.200]   When a pastor desires to draw people to his pastor pulpit
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.200]   so that his pulpit would be a success.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:37.200]   When we use all sort of tactics to draw people,
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   when the drawing is not being done by the cross of Christ,
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.200]   the cross becomes void.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:48.200]   When the main attraction becomes anything other than Christ crucified,
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.200]   the cross becomes void.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.200]   That's what he is saying.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.200]   And so we need to determine the right priority.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:53:01.200]   We need to determine that Christ truly needs to be priority and central.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:07.200]   So by way of summary in this passage, okay, by way of summary in this passage,
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:11.200]   unity is quite powerful, right?
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:16.200]   Unity is quite powerful, and he wants the church to agree.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.200]   Just think about that for a moment how powerful unity is, okay?
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:25.200]   Many cults draw people by just their unity, you know?
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:29.200]   So many people are tired of the churches, the Protestant churches,
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.200]   where the elders are fighting in the parking lot,
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.200]   and they're punching each other and boxing it out, you know?
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:38.200]   So many people are tired of like, "Why are there millions of denominations,
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.200]   and why is it so confusing?"
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:44.200]   And so when they find a group where they're like committed to each other
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:47.200]   and they're in absolute unity and they're striving together,
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:51.200]   although it might be entirely wrong, they're attracted by that, right?
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.200]   But the thing about it is those cults are drawn together
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:58.200]   simply by trying to build that theology.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:03.200]   They're knitted together by simply what the cult is trying to accomplish.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:07.200]   But for those of us who are in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.200]   we're held together by his spirit.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.200]   We're held together by his truth.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   We're held together in him.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.200]   And that should be actually something so powerful as a testimony
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.200]   to what Christ has done.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.200]   And so so many times in scripture and according to Christ's own words,
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:25.200]   he calls the church to be in true unity.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.200]   As a matter of fact, in John chapter 17,
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:32.200]   Jesus prays in his high priestly prayer before the cross
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:37.200]   to God he prays that the people would be one.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.200]   Just as God and the Son are one,
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.200]   to that measure, Christ prays that the people would be one.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.200]   In Ephesians 4.3, it says,
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:50.200]   "Be diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace."
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.200]   And if you would, turn your Bibles over to Romans chapter 15.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:59.200]   In a context where Apostle Paul challenges the church and says,
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.200]   "Those of you guys who are strong,
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.200]   those of you guys who think you're mature,
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:07.200]   why don't you bear the weakness of those who are weaker?
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:11.200]   Why don't you bear the burden for the edification of the church?"
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:14.200]   But furthermore, he says this in verse five,
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:16.200]   "Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:19.200]   grant you to be of the same mind with one another
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.200]   according to Christ Jesus,
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:26.200]   so that with one accord you may with one voice
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:29.200]   glorify God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:33.200]   Therefore, accept one another just as Christ also accepted us
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.200]   to the glory of God."
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:40.200]   So, in thinking about that, Apostle Paul's ultimate vision,
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.200]   he sees the glory of God as the ultimate reason
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:48.200]   for us to give 100%, give all the energy and persevere
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:52.200]   in trying to be of one accord and agreement with each other.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.200]   Amen?
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.200]   Alright.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:58.200]   Any questions about the passage or the stuff that we covered so far?
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:00.200]   Okay.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:02.200]   So, by way of just kind of your discussion,
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:06.200]   I want to go over some of these questions.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:11.200]   Maybe you guys can think about, list as many negative examples
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:16.200]   or negative ramifications that can result from disunity.
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.200]   And I gave you one.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.200]   Your pastors will be really, really sad.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.200]   Okay?
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.200]   They're going to cry.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.200]   Name other ramifications of disunity.
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.200]   Okay?
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:30.200]   What can disunity in the church do for fellowship,
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:34.200]   do for witness, do for worship, do for practical sanctification?
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:38.200]   What will disunity in the church cause?
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.200]   Okay?
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:42.200]   Personal life, church life, all around.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:46.200]   But here's another one that I think would be interesting.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:51.200]   How do you react when there are differences of opinion?
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.200]   How do you react when there's confrontation
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.200]   and you're at odds with somebody?
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.200]   How do you typically react?
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.200]   Okay?
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:05.200]   And, you know, just, again, I put this in there because I know how I typically react.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:08.200]   It's like, I'm not going to deal with you anymore.
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.200]   Goodbye.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.200]   And then you just leave them alone forever and you don't talk with them, you know?
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.200]   That's sometimes what we do.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.200]   Share more personally.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.200]   How do you typically resolve or maybe not resolve?
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.200]   Okay?
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:23.200]   And then three, I do hope that, again, you guys, you know,
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.200]   there isn't like a small group leader in your small group.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.200]   It's just discussion.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.200]   Let's be as open as possible.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:31.200]   Are there any relationships or problems that are still unresolved?
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.200]   Okay?
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.200]   And you guys can all just be like, "Okay, guys, this stays here."
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.200]   Okay?
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.200]   Whatever it may be, just share.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.200]   Are there things that are unresolved?
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:42.200]   Are there things that you've ignored for a long time?
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:47.200]   And how can you apply, be diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.200]   and the bond of peace in that situation?
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:54.200]   But also please brainstorm, how do we strive for greater unity in--
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.200]   Man, that is such a bad mistake.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.200]   [laughs]
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.200]   Dang it, I thought I was doing so good until the end.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.200]   All right.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:04.200]   Anyway, you guys know what I mean by that.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:05.200]   [laughs]
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.200]   All right?
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:10.200]   If it is just to the degree of like, "Hey, maybe I just need to be more open,"
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.200]   you know, "Maybe I just need to be more vulnerable."
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:18.200]   Again, we actually struggle with this at a church as a church is growing.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.200]   How much do I share?
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.200]   How much is public?
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.200]   How much is not?
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:24.200]   We have sisters who are resting like, "I'm pregnant.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.200]   Do I share this or do I not?"
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:27.200]   You know?
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.200]   "Do I ask people for prayer?
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:29.200]   Do I not?
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:31.200]   Do I wait until the first trimester is over?"
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:33.200]   We have people where they're suffering.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.200]   They struggle with certain things.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.200]   They wonder, "Should I share?
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   Should I not?"
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   All that kind of stuff.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.200]   "How much do I pry?
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.200]   How much do I do this?"
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.200]   There's things to talk about, okay?
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.200]   So please talk about those things.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:50.200]   And then lastly, your homework assignment is going to be a big chunk.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:55.200]   Verse 18 through Chapter 2, Verse 5, please make all the observations as you can.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:59.200]   If you guys need a rule, I typically go by the rule,
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.200]   "At least make two observations for every verse."
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.200]   Okay?
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.200]   And then I always try to ask a question per verse.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.200]   Now, it takes a while, but it's a good practice.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:12.200]   But I have some questions for you to answer after that,
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:15.200]   and then you guys can come prepared with that homework.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.200]   Okay?
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.200]   Any questions?
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.200]   All right, then.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.200]   Let me pray for us, and then you guys can get into your discussion groups.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:34.200]   Heavenly Father, I pray, God, that all the more the spiritual realities would impact us.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:39.200]   That God, although, yes, we are not physical brothers,
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:45.200]   God, now that we are Christians in the spirit, we are more than brothers.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:49.200]   God, that spiritually we are tied, and we are to be one.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:53.200]   Father, I pray that these spiritual truths would impact us and cause us, God,
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:58.200]   to then both function and think underneath that truth.
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:03.200]   God, I pray that you would forgive us for any time we've been so prideful.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:10.200]   That, God, we would touch your glory, and we would continue striving for our name to be magnified.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:15.200]   Forgive us of times when we used, especially of times if we've ever used the church,
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.200]   anything spiritual, for our own end.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.200]   I pray, Father, God, that you would humble us, and then, God, that you would restore us
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.200]   and help us to live in humility.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.200]   Help us to live in true brokenness.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.200]   For, God, we know that then we are strong in you.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:35.200]   Lord, I pray that you would cause us to be a church, not arrogant and not prideful,
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.200]   thinking that we are more than that we truly are.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:42.200]   But, God, that you would cause us to be a church truly humble in the spirit.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:46.200]   Father, Lord, we thank you for your word. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
