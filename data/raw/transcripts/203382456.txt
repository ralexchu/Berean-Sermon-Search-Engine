[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920]   - Alright, by way of thinking through where we're at now in this passage last time, Apostle
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:21.120]   Peter really gave a description of who we are as people and gave us a capacity, a category
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.040]   to make sense of the experiences that they were going through, right?
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.040]   Essentially by saying, "This is who you are.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.240]   You're chosen.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.240]   This is who you are.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.480]   God's building you up.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.880]   This is who you are, the holy priesthood that God has been preparing for his service."
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.760]   And through those means, he's able to say, "And so, the experiences that we're having
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.740]   is in line with the plan of God.
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.640]   He's doing a mighty work in you even if you don't feel like it."
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.040]   Now on top of that though, the experiences that they felt, nonetheless, it's a tricky
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.520]   circumstance.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.920]   It's one thing to feel a sense of, "I'm okay.", but then there's another question, "But what
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.920]   do I do?"
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.920]   Right?
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.080]   And in many ways for us too in this generation, it's not as though, I mean life in a sense
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.880]   is easy, but really the tension between ideologies, the tension between what we believe and what
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.600]   the world believes is going to continue to come a conflict.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.400]   And there's going to be rising tension, as scripture would say, over time to the degree
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.720]   that as it gets closer and closer to the time of Christ's return, it's going to be quite
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.720]   intense.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.720]   Right?
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.720]   That's what we can anticipate.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.400]   So, in order to navigate through that, the tension and the kind of hostile environment
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.240]   that we have, what are we to do?
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.000]   Well, the section that we're getting into is, after he said, "This is who you are, this
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.200]   is who you are," he's going to say, "Since this is who you are, here is how you should
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.440]   live.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.480]   This is the lifestyle you should exhibit."
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.640]   And that's what we're getting into today.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.760]   So please turn over to chapter two, and we're going to start reading from verse 11 down
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.280]   to verse 20.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   Okay?
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.480]   Chapter two, verse 11 down to verse 20.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.040]   And he says, "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.000]   which wage war against the soul.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.920]   Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles so that in the things in which they slander
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.320]   you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds as they observe them, glorify God
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.440]   in the day of visitation.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.120]   Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a king as one
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.720]   in authority or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers in the praise
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.320]   of those who do right.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.880]   For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.880]   men.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.120]   Act as free men and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bond
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.920]   slaves of God.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.920]   Honor all people.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.920]   Love the brotherhood.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.920]   Fear God.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.520]   Honor the king.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.480]   Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.640]   and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.480]   For this finds favor.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.800]   If for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.240]   unjustly.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.560]   For what credit is there if when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.560]   patience.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.240]   But if when you do what is right and suffer for it, you patiently endure it, this finds
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.800]   favor with our God.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   Let's pray.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.600]   Father, we thank you for the scripture truth.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.080]   We ask God that you would continue to open up our eyes, illumine the word to our hearts,
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.400]   and allow us also to be exposed to your word.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.760]   God, that there wouldn't be anything reserved by which your spirit cannot change.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.760]   Father, we thank you.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.760]   It's in Christ's name.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.840]   Amen.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.200]   So again, Apostle Peter is going to be giving an exhortation.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.960]   He says, I urge you.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.760]   And so now he's giving this exhortation and plea.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.960]   This is what I desire for you, right?
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.280]   And this exhortation is actually going to span all the way to chapter 411.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.920]   So from here forward, you're going to feel a sentiment where maybe before there was a
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.760]   lot of descriptive, like this is what God's doing.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.200]   This is who you are.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.120]   This is who you were meant to be, that kind of talk.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.880]   But now there's going to be commands, right?
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.680]   Commands and imperatives for us to follow.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.120]   Well, let's take a look at verses 11 and 12 together.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.240]   And the scripture again says, "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.000]   from fleshly lusts, which wage war against the soul.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.200]   Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.440]   you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds as they observe them, glorify God
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.200]   in the day of visitation."
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.640]   As we look at passage of verse 11, let's do a two minute grammar session.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.560]   So I'll just give you a forewarning.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.680]   We're going to do two minutes of boring stuff.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.200]   Here, what I mean by a grammar session is this.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.640]   Grammar matters a lot because it helps us categorize, outline, and divide thought.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.800]   We've been talking a lot about that before.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.320]   When you look at these, it says, "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers."
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.520]   You actually can put a comma after the word you and after the word strangers.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.920]   That little phrase, "as aliens and strangers," in grammar is called a positive clause.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.240]   That a positive is giving you a redefinition of that preceding pronoun, of that preceding
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.120]   noun.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.520]   So examples of that is if you say, "Hey, there's Karen, the girl sitting behind me, is wearing
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.000]   a green shirt."
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.800]   It's just a clause that redefines Karen or gives a greater definition of it.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.880]   Boom, two minutes are done.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.560]   Why do I talk about that?
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.280]   Because actually, Apostle Peter uses that kind of language where he uses a positive
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.480]   to redefine, redefine a lot.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.160]   21 times in the first four chapters.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.360]   So as you notice his style of writing, he'll say, "As living stones, as this, as aliens
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   and strangers," you can say he's giving us a redefinition and a paradigm by which we
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.080]   can redefine and interpret what we're experiencing.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.480]   He's giving us a perspective.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:28.600]   And what's more, even in his own eyes, okay, even in his own eyes, as he sees the people,
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.240]   he'll begin by saying, "Beloved, you are aliens and strangers, right?
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.680]   And you, I'm exhorting to do this."
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.240]   And so I want to begin by having this first point, the perspective.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.280]   Okay, the perspective.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.520]   The perspective that Apostle Peter is encouraging us to have is a perspective as aliens and
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.680]   strangers, right?
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.400]   That you are supposed to have a perspective like, "I'm a foreigner here."
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.400]   Okay?
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:05.560]   By way of hands, how many of you are first generation, aka FAB?
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.560]   Okay?
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:15.960]   All ashamed, like, except for Chris, he's like, "That's fine, you know?"
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.680]   The whole idea here is there's a sense by which in reality, yeah, I mean, you know,
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.480]   our culture is all about like, "There's no difference.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.000]   We're this and this, and we're all bleeding into one."
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.560]   No, the reality is we're different, you know?
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.760]   For me, I had two instances when I was very clearly different is when I, right in the
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.720]   middle of high school, changed schools, and my school was about 96% Jewish, and I was
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.860]   the one Asian kid.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.560]   And then my senior year, another Asian kid come in and came in, and everyone's like,
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.560]   "Hey, is that your brother?"
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.560]   You know, like, "That's not my brother, okay?
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.560]   I don't know him."
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:57.160]   And it was just this kind of like, the difference was very clear, you know?
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.400]   Now from that analogy, I mean, we know the scripture teaches us many times.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:08.600]   Every time the scripture calls us holy, you know, a royal priesthood that's chosen, God
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:14.380]   is constantly saying, "I am consecrating you and setting you apart."
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:19.560]   As a foreigner, there should be something distinct about you, clearly distinct about
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.160]   you, right?
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:27.320]   So the paradigm and the kind of redefinition is like this idea of clearly you're different
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.240]   than all these people, you know what I'm saying?
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.720]   And your attitude and mindset should be that of not just like, "Oh, but I want to belong
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.720]   so bad."
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.440]   No, you are an ambassador, right?
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.440]   You're not a tourist.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.440]   You're not a tourist going through this life saying, "I want to experience that.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.440]   I want to taste that.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.800]   You know, I want to put that in my little scrapbook."
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.520]   And that is not your perspective in life.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.100]   That's not your paradigm.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.440]   Your paradigm is, "I'm an ambassador with a message of God from a foreign nation."
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.780]   Okay?
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.120]   You should be thinking on the level of like, "I'm a representative from a foreign nation
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.040]   coming in with a message from a foreign king."
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.040]   Right?
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.680]   That's the kind of paradigm shift we have.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.560]   Other paradigms, it's similar, you know, there's that book Pilgrim's Progress, all that kind
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.560]   of stuff.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.120]   As much as scripture is telling us, you take the example of Abraham.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.080]   He was called as a chosen nation, but what's weird is he was called as a chosen nation,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.080]   but most of his life he lived as a foreigner walking through towns, God constantly telling
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.280]   him, "You're not there yet.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.280]   You're not there yet."
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:41.760]   That he had a destination far beyond what he was seeing, far beyond where he was stepping.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.760]   That's the idea.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.960]   And Hebrews chapter 11 tells us we have to have that mentality, constantly understanding
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.400]   that this is not where we belong.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.520]   Our citizenship is far beyond here.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.680]   As a matter of fact, we are still thus waiting for that country of our own.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.560]   So that's the perspective we should have.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:06.240]   So, he says, "You beloved, as aliens and strangers, as foreigners."
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.440]   I want to ask you this question then, and you guys can jot it down on your blank next
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.640]   to application.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:18.840]   From the analogy that he gives and the metaphor that he gives, what application can you draw?
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.400]   Aside from the one that I just said, what application can you draw?
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.200]   The second part to that is, specifically for you.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.800]   When we make applications as we do our own Bible studies, if you just make applications
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.520]   of like, "Yeah, generally we should all believe."
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.800]   That's absolutely true.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.120]   "Yeah, generally we should all change."
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.240]   That's absolutely true.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.200]   But you have to make sure that application is personal.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   Please take two minutes and jot down some application in that so you can share it later
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   on.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.200]   Okay?
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:11:17.200]   [PAUSE]
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   [PAUSE]
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   [PAUSE]
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   [PAUSE]
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   [PAUSE]
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.200]   Okay, great.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   Okay, then moving forward, we take a look at the passage again.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:37.080]   He says, "I'm urging you to abstain from fleshy lusts which wage against your soul, and keep
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.700]   your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the things in which they slander
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.760]   you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.400]   God in the day of visitation."
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   Okay?
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.200]   Real quickly, this is a toss-up, easy, home run.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.200]   Okay?
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.640]   What are the two main commands in verse 11 and 12?
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.600]   Go ahead and please just say it.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.600]   "Abstain."
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.600]   Good.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.600]   And the second one?
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   [PAUSE]
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.600]   Sorry?
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.600]   Okay.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   So, let's see.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   You can just do the two, "Abstain," and then verse 12, "Keep."
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.600]   Right?
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   One is "Abstain" and "Keep."
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.920]   And if I was doing a sermon, right, if I was doing a sermon, I kind of share with you guys
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:36.280]   how I prepare sermons, because I never want you guys to feel like, "Oh, you know, we're
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.040]   never going to really," like, you personally, as you do your own Bible study, aren't going
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:46.280]   to get to, like, that, I don't know, like, um, arrive at some of these points unless
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.280]   I read commentary.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.280]   Have you guys ever felt like that?
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.840]   Like, you read a passage, and you're like, "I don't know, I don't, I'm not really getting
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.800]   anything, and I feel like I can't get these points out unless I read commentaries that
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.920]   make points for you."
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:03.760]   But I want to share, like, no, the, if you sit, and then you dissect, and then you organize
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.720]   the thought, the points kind of jump out at you.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.400]   So essentially, you have two main commands when he says, "I'm urging you in this hostile
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.040]   generation, this is what you need to do."
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.040]   That's how I prepare my sermon.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.840]   "In this hostile generation, I've got two commands for you," you know?
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840]   And that's it.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.480]   One is "Abstain," and in order to make it cute, you make it rhyme a little bit, right?
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.520]   So I'd be like, you know, "Abstain and maintain," you know, or something like that, I don't
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.520]   know.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.760]   So what you do here is, you've got your negative command, and then you've got your positive
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.760]   command.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.120]   And so those are my two outlines underneath this passage in terms of the second part,
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.800]   which are the main commands.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   One is to abstain from fleshly lusts, and then second, maintain, or keep a good way
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.800]   of life.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   Okay?
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.440]   Now, let's talk about those two things a little bit.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:56.520]   First, I want us to see what he's saying here in terms of the description that he gives
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.240]   about the fleshly lusts.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:05.760]   He says, "You have to abstain from the lusts in your life because these things wage war
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.680]   against your soul."
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.720]   Dang, right?
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:16.880]   "The desires that exist in our hearts wage war against us."
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.200]   That's really descriptive.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.040]   You might see it as like, "I'm just kind of struggling."
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.020]   No, this is not a kind of struggling.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.200]   This is not an annoying habit that I have.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:33.720]   The desires in our hearts that are, and it's not just reserved for sexual lust, you know?
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.680]   Because other passages in scripture tells us that the desires and lusts of our heart
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.840]   go much deeper than just sex.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.840]   Okay?
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:47.400]   So sometimes we might see these things as more docile, problematic hurdles in our lives,
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.600]   but the way that Apostle Peter is describing them is, "Guys, the desires in our hearts
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.000]   and the lusts of our flesh is actually waging war.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.760]   It's hostile, malicious, and it's trying to dominate us."
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.600]   Did you know that ever since the beginning in the book of Genesis, when the scriptures
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:14.640]   describe sin, it talks about how sin's desires for you as by way of wanting to overtake you.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.080]   And I'm sure you guys have felt that maybe at some point or another in your spiritual
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.080]   battles, right?
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:26.240]   Where the kind of monster of sin, so to speak, is really powerful.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.360]   Whenever there's a desire in your heart, whenever there's a lust in your heart, it continues
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:36.080]   to grow, it continues to feed, and then it will decay your soul.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   It will decay your insides.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.760]   There's a passage in 1 John 2, 15 through 17.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.440]   He says, "Do not love the world or the things of the world.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.600]   If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.360]   For all that is of the world, the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes,
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.320]   the pride of life, is not from the Father, but is of the world.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:04.840]   The world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever."
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:11.800]   So here's this passage that's describing for us the sin that exists, and he says, "Abstain."
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.040]   On the flip side, so there's the negative.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.080]   On the flip side, he says, "Keep a good way of life."
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:24.040]   If you guys can, I'm gonna have some of you turn to your Bibles and read correlating cross
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:30.600]   surfaces that teach us the same kind of idea of how we should live as priests, as a chosen
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.940]   nation, as people who are living in a hostile world.
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.080]   So I'm gonna call on some of you guys, okay?
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.880]   From the table on my left.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:43.480]   Stephen, can you look up Matthew chapter, or yeah, can you look up Matthew chapter 5,
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.800]   verse, let's see, 14 through 16?
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.720]   And then from this table right in front, Rachel, can you look up the James chapter 3, verse
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.840]   13 through 15?
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:02.520]   And then from right in front, Aaron, can you look up Luke chapter 6, verse 32 through 36?
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.600]   Okay?
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.840]   So in that order, Stephen first, go ahead and please read that.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   "You are the light of the world.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:22.840]   The city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:33.840]   Nor do people light up the world sitting under a basket, but understand, it gives light to
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.840]   the world, and it gives light to the world.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:49.840]   The light of the world is what you show, words and a meekness, no wisdom.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.840]   But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast and be
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.840]   false to the truth.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.840]   This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly and spiritual wisdom."
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.840]   And then, "If you love those who love you, what benefit is that to you?
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   For even sinners love those who love them.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.840]   And if you do good to those who do good to you, what benefit is that to you?
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.840]   For even sinners do the same.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   And if you lend to those from whom you expect to learn, what benefit is that to you?
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.840]   For even sinners do the same.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   And if you lend to those from whom you expect to learn, what benefit is that to you?
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.840]   For even sinners do the same.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.840]   And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you?
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   Even sinners lend to sinners to get back the same amount.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.840]   But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.840]   will be great.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.840]   You will be sons of the Most High, for He is kind to them, grateful, and merciful.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.840]   Be merciful, even as your father did."
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.840]   Excellent.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.840]   Okay.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:32.280]   So, we just read several cross references saying exactly the same thing that Apostle
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.640]   Peter is saying.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.120]   Words from Christ teaching us, we have to be a light.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.440]   We have to be noticeable.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.440]   We have to be a light.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.960]   But, when we are in the midst of struggle, our temptation is to go hide under a rock.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960]   Right?
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.200]   When we're in the midst of persecution, our temptation is to run away.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.220]   When we're in the midst of difficulty that we can't seem to overcome, then we stiff
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.200]   arm them and say, "You're a pagan, I need to be holy."
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.520]   And you isolate yourself.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.320]   And he says, "No.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.400]   The greater challenge is for you to actually not only simply resist the temptation, but
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.640]   in this time, live a lifestyle that is holy.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.520]   Live a lifestyle that's good and godly, so that people may see it."
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:22.040]   And we're reminded of this fact, not only do people naturally, they get their idea of
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.580]   God from you.
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:28.240]   People naturally get their notions of God from reading other people who claim to be
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.060]   God's children.
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:35.640]   Not only is that simply the case, that's how God designed it.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.320]   Right?
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.480]   That you would be, in many ways, to the unbelieving world, the book that they read to get a notion
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.400]   of who God is.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.160]   And so quickly we move to this idea of purpose, and it's very clear, he says, the purpose
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:53.680]   is that they would recognize your work and glorify God.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.080]   Right?
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:00.960]   That this is an immense opportunity in the moments when it's most unlikely, highly improbable,
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.960]   and most difficult.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.800]   Here is this great opportunity to glorify our Heavenly Father.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   And truthfully, in this past week, when we're talking about the Indian pastors, while the
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   team was out in India, and the thing that they experienced, right?
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.720]   And then, you know, the whole team, when they came back, they would keep mentioning, like,
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:25.680]   God used that thing, which seemed really unsettling, ultimately for his glory.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:32.320]   But just imagine, just imagine if the officials came with the culprits and said, "What do
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.000]   you guys want to do?
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.040]   Do you guys want them to go to jail?"
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.120]   And in their minds, they thought, "Yeah, what were you guys thinking?"
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.120]   You know?
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.520]   In their revenge, in their sense of, like, "Oh, this needs to be justice.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.520]   You know what's right?
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.240]   That they should be punished."
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:53.400]   Well, what happened is, yeah, maybe justice might prevail, so to speak.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.680]   Maybe they get their just desert.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.280]   They get what's coming to them.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.960]   But the opportunity there is, but is God glorified?
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.920]   And how awesome was it that there was an opportunity to describe?
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.320]   This is what's going to empower us to be merciful and forgiving to you, right?
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:17.140]   This is the name of the Savior who empowers us to do something that you might not expect.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.720]   So if anything, when there's persecution, when there's suffering and difficulty, we
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.720]   shouldn't be surprised, because we expect it.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.720]   Who should be surprised?
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.720]   They all should.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.720]   What in the world?
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:31.080]   Why do you guys do that?
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.120]   What principles do you operate by?
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.120]   Why?
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.120]   Right?
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.760]   That's the way that Apostle Peter is describing the situation.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:45.560]   The strategy here is, rather than withdraw, rather than isolate, we are to maintain and
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.720]   keep a lifestyle, speaking truth into individuals' lives.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:55.400]   I remember there was a time when I was stressed out, a long time ago, when I was driving up
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.960]   and down from seminary.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:04.480]   On my way down, I would just visit, like, little lakes to kind of, you know how, well,
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.160]   I kind of have an old soul, so I like going out and just kind of sitting there with my
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.920]   hands behind my back and thinking if I'm stressed.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.400]   So I'd go visit the Cerritos, like there's this man-made lake in Cerritos, I'd stop by
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.320]   there and just walk around, you know?
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.080]   And then there's this really nice lake in Fullerton, I think it's called Laguna Lake.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.360]   If you guys have never been there, it's worth just kind of walking around, it's super nice.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.120]   Very secluded, people are fishing there, you know?
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.300]   And I was all stressed out, so I just went there and did one of my, you know, usual old
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:36.400]   man thing, but my, you know, just had me on my back and was just kind of strolling along,
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.080]   and then there was this guy who was fishing and stuff.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.840]   And so I just kind of chit-chatted with him a little bit, I was like, "Hey, you come here
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.120]   often?"
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.520]   And then, you know, you know how fishermen have a stereotype?
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.760]   They're kind of crude, you know, like, they joke, kind of, even their joke and all that
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.240]   kind of jokes and stuff is kind of bad.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.760]   Like this was the stereotype guy who was, you know, he was all stressed out, we were
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.200]   just kind of being sympathetic towards each other and there are like stresses of life
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   and stuff.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.520]   And then he started making these crude jokes about how, you know, "Yeah, my wife thinks
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.880]   I'm at the auto shop, you know, getting my brakes fixed, ha ha ha," you know?
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.760]   And he was making all these jokes about how marriage is this, and that whole concept of
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.760]   marriage being a bondage and stuff.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.640]   Like that's all he was saying.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.680]   Now there was this temptation in me, you know?
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:28.400]   And I'm sure you guys have experienced that temptation, where to be funny with him, I
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.720]   wanted to be like, "Oh yeah, I know what you mean, man," you know?
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.160]   But I just sat there and then I started having this weird battle in my head, you know?
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.320]   I was like, "What should I say?
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.320]   What should I say?"
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.080]   You know, I can't laugh with him because that's wrong.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.760]   But should I be like, "Hey man, you should go home to your wife," you know?
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.160]   Should I rebuke him?
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.920]   I didn't know what to say.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:53.320]   What was really funny is I just kind of had this idea of saying like, "Dude, man, it'd
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.680]   be cool if our wives could join us," you know?
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:05.840]   And he just kind of stopped and he was like, "Yeah," you know?
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:13.000]   And we just, as soon as I said that, like his crude joking just stopped, you know?
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.800]   And I think for us, there's a sense in which we could always just jump on the bandwagon
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.080]   and do everything that they say.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.260]   We could always at our workplace just jump on the bandwagon and gossip.
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.640]   We could at our workplace just jump on the bandwagon and do everything, run exactly the
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.500]   same way, right?
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.240]   But I'm sure you have experience in your workplace, once you become that source of light, not
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:38.280]   all of a sudden people who are like in their own struggles, they come to you.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.800]   You're the guy at your office, like we can trust that guy, you know?
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.120]   You're the guy at the office where like everyone's cursing and stuff, you walk in, they're like,
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.640]   "Oops," you know, you have to stop.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.440]   That's a good thing.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.600]   It's not a bad thing when people all of a sudden feel an aura of holiness around you.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.020]   That's actually a good thing.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.060]   Don't try to avoid it.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.660]   Remember, alien and stranger, you're going to be different.
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:04.500]   And by your lifestyle, you need to make that kind of environmental impact around you.
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.500]   Does that make sense?
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:12.460]   And Apostle Peter is saying, "Especially now, especially when now when the world is looking
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:19.300]   at you to persecute you, make this opportunity to glorify God by abstaining from your own
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:25.260]   selfishness and keeping a lifestyle that's good and holy, even in the eyes of pagans."
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.260]   Okay?
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.260]   All right.
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:36.340]   Next, we take a look at the next section and he moves for another command, verse 13 through
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.340]   15, right?
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.340]   Verse 13 through 15.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:44.940]   And then in this passage, I'll read it for us, it says, "Submit yourself for the Lord's
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:51.900]   sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority or to governors
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:57.180]   as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right.
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:02.540]   For such is the will of God that by doing right, you may silence the ignorance of foolish
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:03.540]   men."
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.540]   Okay.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.540]   Main command.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:11.900]   So when I read my Bible and I just mark it all up, whenever there's a main command, I
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.620]   just put a fat C right there and I just kind of meditate on that.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.620]   The idea of submit.
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.620]   Okay?
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.620]   Submit.
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:23.660]   And I'm just sitting here thinking, "Oh man, he's telling them to submit."
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:30.820]   And I just, I want you guys to just put yourself in their shoes, you know?
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:35.900]   So if you can imagine, you know, maybe like, I don't know, a scenario where someone comes
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.660]   to you and they're just like, "Oh my gosh, my parents are just beating me down.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.260]   My parents are like verbally abusing me.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.460]   My parents are coming off and they're just controlling my life.
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:50.180]   They're just, you know, pressuring me so much and I'm bottled up and I just can't take it
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.180]   anymore."
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.820]   And your next words are like, "Uh, submit?"
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.820]   How do you say that to people who are suffering in that fashion?
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.980]   Now I just gave a parental, I'm just trying to put it in our day.
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:07.480]   I mean, think about job situation, think about marriage situation, family situation, whatever
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:11.900]   situation you can imagine where the worst case scenario, somebody is above you and you
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.660]   feel oppressed.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.700]   And then your encouragement is, "Uh, we gotta submit."
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.060]   What does he mean by that?
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:29.980]   Well, in here, if you look at this, I think there might be people who, because of their
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.540]   Christian faith, they're like, "You know what?
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.100]   We're Christians.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.200]   We abide by a higher law.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.740]   We have a God who's higher, so forget them."
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:39.740]   You know?
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.380]   Their solution is, "Because I have God as my God, forget that.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.340]   I'm not even doing anything they say."
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.340]   Right?
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.420]   You can imagine that could happen because he talks about it.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.980]   You think that because of your allegiance to God, now there's an excuse to deny any
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.460]   submission to earthly authority.
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.140]   And he says the complete opposite.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.380]   You actually have to submit even more.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:04.040]   The term for submit is the Greek word, "Hupotasso."
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.540]   You guys have probably heard it before.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.640]   It is a military term.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.580]   Just as a commanding officer, when he gives an order, the soldier is expected to fall
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.820]   in line.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:17.940]   The word literally has the idea of falling under somebody.
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.700]   Getting behind the line, so to speak.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.700]   Okay?
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.580]   So the term there is not a euphemism for something other than that.
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.060]   No, it is what it says.
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:31.060]   You have to go underneath somebody and submit to their command.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:35.900]   That's what Apostle Paul says in Romans chapter 13.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:41.740]   A lot of other passages talk about authority and the fact that Christians should understand
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.340]   that concept.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.340]   What it means to submit.
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.580]   I want to quickly turn to an application.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.020]   Turn for us.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:56.780]   Do you, do you have family situations?
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.820]   Work situations?
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.540]   Church situations?
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:07.620]   Church other situations where it is difficult for you to yield?
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:12.620]   Do you have circumstances where it is difficult for you to yield to somebody else?
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:17.980]   Do you have a micromanaging, you know, department manager and he is always telling you, "Do
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:18.980]   this, do this, do this, do this.
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:19.980]   That's your next step.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:20.980]   No, no, no, no, no, no."
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.220]   And you are like, "Stop telling me what to do!"
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:28.380]   Do you have a big brother boss who is always asking, "I want to report, I want to report,
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.380]   I want to report."
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.620]   And he is like, "I don't want to have to answer to you!"
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.780]   You know?
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:39.460]   Do you have one of these self-promoting co-workers who is always taking credit for your work?
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:42.640]   Do you have people who are trying to control you?
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.420]   Maybe a nagging mom, a control freak parent who is always like, "This is how you eat,
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.380]   this is how you dress yourself, this is how you do your hair.
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.460]   Why are you wearing that?"
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.460]   You know?
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:56.580]   I am sure we have people who are pressuring us in that fashion.
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.720]   These things really anger us.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.900]   These things tend to really hit the button for a lot of us.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:08.780]   I remember as I was preparing this, thinking about, yeah, like, imagine the anger of people
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.940]   who are oppressed and pushed up against the wall.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.180]   Have you guys ever felt like that?
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:16.420]   You are back up against the wall, someone is pressuring you real hard, hair bots just
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:17.420]   blow.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.940]   Now, I consider myself a pretty patient guy, you know?
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.540]   Like, I don't get angry too easy.
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.900]   But I do remember distinctly one time in high school where I just blew up.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.800]   And because I am Korean, I typically don't ever show my anger in front of an adult, but
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.120]   it was out on the field and I just blew up and cursed at an adult.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.880]   It's like, I don't know what came over me, okay?
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.160]   But what happened was, me and this buddy were messing around and one of the teachers saw
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:43.840]   us messing around and she didn't like how we were play fighting and stuff like that.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.240]   And then, it wasn't a girl, it was a guy.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:51.360]   And then he came over and grabbed us by the neck right here, like this, you know?
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.960]   And I don't know, that just like instantly caused my blood to boil.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.400]   And I just like slapped his arm and just went off cursing at him.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.280]   Like, don't touch me like that ever, you know?
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.960]   And of course, I got in so much trouble.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:14.640]   But the feeling of someone's hand on the back of my neck made me feel very dehumanized.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.920]   Like made me feel like an animal.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.720]   Very much like my cage got rattled.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.200]   Very much like a dog on chain.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.200]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:29.520]   Now the thing about it is, you think about moments when it's so hard to submit to that
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.720]   authority, it's these times when we're going to react with anger.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:41.160]   But I want to ask, how hard would it have been for these people to hear this?
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.160]   You know?
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.320]   Submit to all kinds of authority.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.920]   You mean Nero?
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.520]   Are you serious?
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.400]   I can just imagine the revolt almost.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.840]   Are you serious?
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.340]   Then coming back and thinking, no way.
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.680]   You do not understand how wicked my boss is.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.480]   How incompetent my boss is, my manager is.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:14.140]   The degree to which Apostle Peter is challenging these individuals to submit is quite incredible.
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.000]   As a matter of fact, later on, he's going to say the exact same thing, or kind of on
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.200]   this line of thought in verse 17, right?
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.920]   Oh sorry, not verse 17.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.040]   Where is the other passage?
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.040]   Verse 18.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:30.240]   "Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.480]   and gentle, but to those who are unreasonable."
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.480]   Right?
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.400]   It's like, what?
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.320]   Nero demands worship.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.200]   Nero demands our death.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   Are you serious?
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:51.360]   Okay, I asked you guys this question, and I wanted you guys purposely to discuss this
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.440]   idea of limit.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:59.120]   When we hear certain things in the scripture, we like to kind of keep, we want to be able
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:04.240]   to accept it in a certain category in our hands, so sometimes we like to set boundaries.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.800]   Okay, that's where that fits.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.040]   I can do that up until this point.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.600]   But the reason why I had you guys talk about it is because look at the terminology, and
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:19.400]   look at the context, and then ask, what is the limit?
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:25.880]   Does he say, submit so long as they're nice to you, so long as it makes sense, so long
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.320]   as it's in your capacity?
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.760]   He says, submit to all human institutions, right?
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:38.000]   And then think about the context and realize, man, whatever boundary I just drew when I
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.200]   read that, that context to which he's speaking to blows my context out of the water.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.200]   I'm having a hard time applying that with my boss.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.320]   I'm not talking about Pastor Peter.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:54.240]   I'm saying if I were you, if I was you, you know, okay, okay, I'm just going to move on
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:57.760]   in there, right?
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.240]   I'm having a, you know, we might have a hard time applying it in this context.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:06.920]   When we think about their context, it just completely blows it out of the water, right?
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:11.640]   I want to bring up the example of Stephen.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.200]   Stephen was a man filled with the Spirit, so full of the Spirit.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.160]   Everyone can look at his face and they're like, man, that guy is so full of the Spirit.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.880]   He's like an angel, you know?
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.320]   Everybody recognized him as an incredibly godly man.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.160]   This man was capable, you know?
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.880]   As capable as capable can be, trustworthy.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:36.560]   He had a level of authority, a level of capacity to speak truth.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:44.920]   And then when the priests, the rulers, they came to judge him, he was submissive.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.920]   Did he retaliate?
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.400]   Did he say, "You're not going to touch me?
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.400]   How dare you?
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.400]   You know who I am?
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.400]   I'm a leader in the church!"
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.400]   You know?
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.520]   Did he start running off and, you know, starting to attack, like Peter take a sword?
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.200]   Like what did he do?
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.160]   He said, "Father, forgive them."
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.660]   And he yielded.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.600]   He yielded his spirit.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.800]   To the point of what?
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.800]   The point of death.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:18.200]   Now, I'm not saying that this application is for every single circumstance, no matter
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.200]   what.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.240]   You have to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:27.040]   But the level to which we should have a capacity to yield is quite surprising.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.000]   He's challenging us here, right?
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.320]   I might be at your limit, but I'm exhorting you, I urge you, learn to submit as Christians,
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:42.840]   as those who understand what it means to surrender and yield your spirit to God and entrust yourself
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.200]   fully to the mighty hand of the Father.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:52.960]   And as you proclaim your allegiance to Him, learn to submit to human authorities as well.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.200]   Right?
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:58.400]   So here is quite a challenge for us on that.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.920]   Now we turn to an important thing.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.320]   With such a difficult command, right?
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:10.880]   With such a difficult to apply command, what are the reasons he gives?
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:17.260]   So with this one, can you guys, you know, contribute by just calling it out?
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:21.240]   When you guys discussed in your group, what reasons does he give to submit?
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.640]   Did I ask that question?
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.680]   I should have, right?
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.680]   Oh yeah, here.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   Oh no.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.680]   Ah, I didn't ask for that, huh?
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.680]   Okay.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.920]   Please take a look at the verse from verse 13 through 20.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:43.080]   And when he says, "Submit yourselves," and then he's going down, just scan your eyes
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.600]   through the thing and start circling real fast.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.520]   What do you see as reasons and motives to submit?
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.520]   What do you guys see?
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:59.520]   To bear a good witness.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.520]   Excellent.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.520]   Okay.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:17.520]   The one that should pop out to you is to bear a good witness.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.520]   Sorry, give me one sec.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:26.520]   I kind of lost my place in my...
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.520]   Okay.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.520]   Okay.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.520]   To bear a good witness to who God is.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.520]   Okay?
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.520]   What else do you guys see?
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:57.520]   And just read it as you see it in that passage and then just highlight it out.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.520]   Starting from verse...
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.520]   Let's see.
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.520]   Yeah, verse 13 down to verse 20.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:11.520]   There's like a long list of reasons.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:16.520]   Anything else?
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.520]   Let's work down through it together.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.520]   Okay?
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.520]   As we take a look at verse 13, immediately he gives reasons.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:29.520]   When he says, "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake."
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.520]   Right?
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:36.520]   Those little prepositions "for" should immediately, you know, kind of give a hint to you.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.520]   This is going to be a reason here.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.520]   "For the Lord's sake."
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:45.520]   And he says, "Whether kings as one in his authority, or governors."
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.520]   And then look at this.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.520]   He says, "As sent by him."
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.520]   So here, you can just highlight "as sent by him" as another reason.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:58.520]   That the reason why we're supposed to submit is because this is God's doing.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.520]   Whoa!
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.520]   That will blow your mind out of the water.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.520]   These governments, these institutions are sent by God?
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.520]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.520]   Don't even hesitate to believe it.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.520]   That's what the nation of Israel needed to get for so long.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.520]   Remember, when the prophets came to preach, when Jeremiah came to preach to the nation and says,
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.520]   "You guys need to surrender because God is using these nations."
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.520]   It's not as though God is not in control.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.520]   That's actually the absolute opposite is true.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:32.520]   God is absolutely in control and that's why you need to surrender, give up.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.520]   Every institution, there is nothing out of that control of God.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.520]   He says, "This is by God's design."
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.520]   He says, "For the punishment of evil doers and the praise of those who do right."
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.520]   And then look at this.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.520]   "For such is the will of God."
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.520]   Again, you see the word "for" gives you another reason.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.520]   "For such is the will of God."
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.520]   And that should really, again, continue to shake you up.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.520]   You're like, "So what?"
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.520]   This is the will of God?
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.520]   You want to know something that's even crazier than that?
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.520]   This is what finds favor in God.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.520]   So if you take a look at verse 19 and 20, "For this finds favor."
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.520]   What finds favor?
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:16.520]   "That if for the sake of conscience towards God, a person bears up under sorrow when suffering unjustly.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:21.520]   For what credit is there if when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience?
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:28.520]   But if you do what is right and suffer for it, you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God."
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:33.520]   Why should you suffer for your own stupidity?
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:41.520]   If you're going to suffer, He wants you to suffer for the name of God, for the sake of righteousness, for the sake of your faith.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.520]   Right?
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.520]   This finds favor with God.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.520]   But let's keep going.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.520]   There's even more.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:51.520]   So if you, we stopped over at verse 15, "For such is the will of God."
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.520]   And then He defines that will.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.520]   "That by doing right, you may silence the ignorance of foolish men."
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:05.520]   So essentially when He says that, you can circle that, it continues to link the causation or the motive and reason by which you must submit.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.520]   Why should you submit?
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.520]   Because by doing so, you're going to make everybody silent.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.520]   How do you do that?
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.520]   How does your righteousness,
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.520]   how does your submission, your surrender, and your good behavior,
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:25.520]   and you bearing up under all these sorrows, silence the people around you?
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.520]   That's a good question to ask.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.520]   How does that all work?
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:34.520]   The best way I can describe it is,
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:41.520]   you know, what's happening in the context is people are slandering Christians unfairly, right?
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.520]   Verse 12 says it.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.520]   They're going to call you evildoers.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:50.520]   Even though when you're doing right, people are going to try and attack you and call you and slander you stuff, right?
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.520]   Now, this, I don't know why, but this reminded me of a lady.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.520]   Her name was Susan Boyle.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.520]   Do you guys remember her?
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.520]   Yeah? Okay.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.520]   If you don't, I'll tell you the story.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:06.520]   In 2009 on Britain's Got Talent, you know, with the judges there,
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.520]   this lady who was frizzly haired, short hair, you know,
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.520]   she looked to be pretty old.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.520]   She was, you know, like pretty unkempt, very plain dress.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:21.520]   She like came up walking off funny and she took the mic and she had a little bit of a spunk to her, kind of an attitude, you know?
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.520]   So Simon initially already is just kind of rolling his eyes.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.520]   And, you know, he asked in his little British accent, he goes, "How old are you, my dear?"
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.520]   And then she's like, "I'm 47."
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.520]   And everyone's like, "Ha ha ha ha ha."
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.520]   And Simon's just kind of like, "Man, let's get this over with," you know?
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.520]   And the other judges is like, you can hear them laughing.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.520]   And then Simon asks her like, "Oh, what's your dream?"
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.520]   And she's like, "To be famous singer," you know?
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.520]   And you know how the story goes.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.520]   Everyone's just sitting there like, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha," you know?
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:54.520]   And then she's like, "I'm going to sing 'I Have a Dream' from Les Miserables," you know?
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:44:01.520]   And then she starts singing and everyone's just jaw drops like, "What? What happened?"
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.520]   Everybody got silent.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.520]   Have you guys ever been in any kind of performance or music where like everyone's just talking to each other?
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.520]   Everyone's just chit-chatting.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:11.520]   They're eating their food, making all this noise.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.520]   And then they start singing and you're just like, and everyone's quiet.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.520]   All you can hear is the singing, right?
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:26.520]   Your submission and ability to yield and die to yourself is so different from this world.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.520]   It's like a beautiful song.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.520]   But that should be the thing that's grabbing people's attention.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.520]   It's like, "Wow!"
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:40.520]   Okay? Your good, pleasing, godly style of life should be like a beautiful song that quiets people.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:45.520]   When people are slandering you, for example, if I say like, "Why are you so lazy?
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.520]   You never do anything. You never help around the house and you never do this."
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.520]   And then if you've ever been on the flip side of that and you're like, "Yes, I do," you know what's going to happen?
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.520]   All you're going to do is get in a verbal fight.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:58.520]   "No, you don't. You didn't do this and you didn't do that and you're just going to go at it."
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:03.520]   How do you silence the other person? By the beauty of your life.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.520]   By your deeds.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:10.520]   You're proving your faith. You're proving the transformation in your life. Right?
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:15.520]   Likewise, Apostle Peter is saying, "You don't need to sit there defending yourself with words.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:20.520]   What you need to do is make sure you maintain and keep the holiness and purity of your life.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:27.520]   And if anything, you should be a people who know submission to the degree, honor the king." Right?
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.520]   And he has a list of little commandments there in verse 17.
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:35.520]   Respect all people. You of all people should know how to do this because you're Christians.
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:42.520]   You know how to honor the king. You know how to give respect where respect is due.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:46.520]   It's not righteous for you to sit there and be like, "I don't give respect to nobody." You know?
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.520]   That's nasty.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.520]   You know how to heal when yielding is necessary.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:56.520]   And you know how to absorb when absorbing is necessary because God has given you the ability to do so.
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.520]   So I pray for all of you guys.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.520]   We're going to experience that kind of oppression. Not oppression, but maybe pressure.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:07.520]   Pressure from the workplace. Pressure from family. Pressure from people around us.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:15.520]   But we will be a people marked by an ability to keep our composure and holiness before God and men.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.520]   Amen? Let's pray.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:30.520]   Father, we want to thank you, God, that you empower us and that you continue to challenge us and exhort us.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:38.520]   We ask, God, that as you have set such a high standard in Christ, that you would give us such a desire to pursue after Him.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:45.520]   God, to look squarely at Christ and see Him as our goal, as our answer, as our ambition.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:51.520]   Lord, that by keeping our eyes fixed on Him, we would all the more resemble Him in our lives.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.520]   Father, we thank you that Christ set the example for us.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:47:02.520]   That, Lord, He did not defend Himself where He could have, but rather He yielded Himself, rather emptied Himself as well.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:07.520]   Lord, I pray that if there is any arrogance in our heart, if there is any ambition,
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:12.520]   if there is any stubbornness that desires to preserve everything about us,
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.520]   I ask that by your Spirit you give us the strength to let that go.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:21.520]   And that, God, we would know what it means as Christ commands us to lose our life, that we'd find it in you.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.520]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name. Amen.
