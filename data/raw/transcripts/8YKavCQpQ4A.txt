[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   Good morning, Church family. Happy Lord's Day.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   Romans 12, verse 12, it reads, "Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer."
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   As we start off this year, may it be our greatest desire to devote ourselves to the Lord,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.500]   especially to devote ourselves to prayer, that we would seek the Lord through prayer.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.000]   And so with that, we will begin our service with the song, "What a Friend We Have in Jesus."
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Sing, "What a Friend."
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.000]   What a friend we have in Jesus.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.500]   All our sins and griefs to bear.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   What a privilege to carry
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Everything to God in prayer.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Oh, what peace we often forfeit.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Oh, what needless pain we bear.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.500]   All because we do not carry
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   Everything to God in prayer.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:06.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.500]   Every trials,
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:14.500]   Every trials and temptations,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.500]   Is there trouble anywhere?
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:27.000]   We should never be discouraged.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Can we find a friend so faithful
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.500]   Who will all our sorrows share?
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:51.500]   Jesus knows our every weakness.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:57.500]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.500]   Blessed Savior.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:06.500]   Blessed Savior, Thou hast promised
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:12.500]   Thou wilt all our burdens bear.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.500]   May we ever, Lord, be bravely
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.500]   All to Thee in earnest pray.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:31.000]   Soon in glory bright and clouded
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.500]   There will be no need for prayer.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Rapture, praise and endless worship
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.500]   Will be our sweet portion there.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.500]   Rapture, praise.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:55.500]   Rapture, praise and endless worship
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:01.500]   Will be our sweet portion there.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.500]   [MUSIC ENDS]
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.500]   All right, good morning. Welcome to Bering Community Church.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.500]   We have an announcement from our sisters.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.000]   I don't know who's coming up.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.500]   Okay. All right.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:26.000]   Members meeting is next Sunday at January 15th at 1.30 p.m.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.500]   So if you are members or you're becoming members,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   this is again a quarterly mandatory meeting that we need you to be there.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.500]   And so if you aren't able to make it, please let us know ahead of time.
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.000]   And so along with that, you know, typically in the past,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   we started our members meeting at 2 o'clock,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   but we're going to--we're upping it at 1.30 so that you guys can finish a bit earlier.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.500]   But because of that, we're going to be having lunch.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.000]   Our BAM ministry, our singles ministry, they're going to prepare lunch for us.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.500]   And the cost of this, just the cost that they need to put into it,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   is $5 for boxed turkey sandwich lunch.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   If you're allergic to turkey, obviously you can get something else,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.500]   but otherwise to save time, please stick around.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.000]   And this is not just for members.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.500]   If you want to just eat and hang around, it would be, again, $5 for the lunch box.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.000]   The youth group at the same time is going to be running a fundraiser.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   They have a retreat coming up,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   and so they're raising funds to help pay for some of the retreats.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And so there's going to be baked goods being sold.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.500]   So when you go out there to eat, you'll see tables set up by the youth group to do that.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.500]   They're also selling Berean sweatshirts for $20.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.500]   Okay, so we have--I'm not going to call it leftover.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:43.500]   They're brand new still, okay, and these are coveted sweatshirts that you all want,
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.500]   but only have a limited supply.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.500]   They're going to be selling that for $20 outside as well,
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.500]   and the proceeds for that will also go toward their retreat, okay?
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.500]   Our new membership class is starting on January 15th.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.500]   That's next Sunday.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.500]   So if you signed up for that, next Sunday at 9 a.m.,
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.500]   they're going to be meeting in the youth group room, right?
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.500]   Youth group room at the Vine, and it's an eight-week course.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.500]   So if you haven't signed up and you still want to take that class,
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.500]   and again, this is--at the end of that, there's a covenant signing
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.500]   where you become a member at that time.
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.500]   So if you haven't signed up for that, please sign up.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.500]   And if you didn't sign up, or if you did sign up,
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.500]   next Sunday is going to be the first class, okay?
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.500]   Family ministry, community groups,
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.500]   where you're going to be broken up into smaller groups
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.500]   to get to know other family members.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.500]   That's starting in January 29th, and the sign-up is by next Sunday.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.500]   So if you haven't signed up for that and you want to participate,
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.500]   please sign up for that as soon as possible.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.500]   And again, all of these things are on the website.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.500]   It's on the Facebook page.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.500]   It's on the church app.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.500]   So if you go to those things, there will be a sign-up portal for all of that.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And then for sisters ministry, I'll just give you a quick plug.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Women's ministry tea time is Saturday on January 28th at 930.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Then intentional sisters fellowship is happening beginning in mid-February to May,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and they're going to be reading the book, "Don't Waste Your Life" by John Piper.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   So if you want to participate in that, please sign up for that as well.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   All right, so after the offering time, we have--
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Megan Ma is going to be coming up and giving her testimony and be baptized.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   So let me pray for the offering,
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.500]   and then again, those of you who brought physical offering,
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.500]   physical offering boxes in the back.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.500]   All right, let's pray.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:36.500]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your continued grace throughout this week.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.500]   And as we face a new year with new challenges,
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:45.000]   help us, Lord God, to truly be committed to the things that you've called us for,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.500]   that we would not simply be worshipers in lip service,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.500]   but that you would fill our hearts, Lord God, with your presence, your grace,
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.500]   that your word would continue to speak to us and guide us and build your church.
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.500]   We pray this morning as we give our offering,
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:05.500]   help us even in that, that we would give with a cheerful heart,
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.500]   not under compulsion, and may it be multiplied for your use.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:14.500]   Amen. You may be seated.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:28.500]   Hi, my name is Megan. I grew up going to a Baptist church with very limited knowledge of what it means to be a Christian.
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.500]   If you were to ask me what being a Christian meant, I would answer going to church on Sunday.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.500]   To me, church was a place I could see my friends and I went purely out of habit.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.500]   The youth pastor at the time had left the church when I was about to enter high school
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.500]   and because a lot of my friends were going off to college, I also stopped going to church.
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:49.500]   I made excuses saying I was tired or had a lot of homework to get out of attending church on Sunday.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:54.500]   When I entered college in Boston, my parents urged me to find a church, so I visited a church with my roommate,
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:25:00.500]   but because of its Presbyterian values were different than what I was used to, I didn't continue to go.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:04.500]   Because I had been away from the church for so long, going to church wasn't a priority for me.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:09.500]   I would say my time in Boston is only temporary and never made an effort.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:14.500]   The first two years of college were simple, went by without any issues.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:19.500]   It wasn't until my third year that I started to feel the stress and pressure to get into PA school.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.500]   On top of that, I started to lose a lot of relationships that were very precious to me.
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:28.500]   I blamed God for this low point in my life and started to harbor bitterness towards him.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:34.500]   Without knowing any better, I fell into the wrong crowd and turned to partying as a form of temporary joy.
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:40.500]   I continued to party for a year until I started PA school and I had to turn away from that lifestyle to focus on school.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.500]   I became a very anxious person when I entered PA school, always fearing that I would fall behind
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.500]   or that I didn't have what it takes to become a PA.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:54.500]   God became someone I would turn to when I needed something from him, for example, passing a test.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:59.500]   When I achieved something I wanted, I felt like all my efforts were because of my own accord and not God's grace.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:05.500]   After a long and stressful year of clinicals, I suddenly had a change of heart and wanted to go back to church.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:10.500]   This is when a family friend had told me about Bruin and I eventually started coming out in March.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.500]   Coming to Bruin, I realized how inadequate my knowledge of God actually was.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:19.500]   Although hard to accept, I realized I wasn't a Christian even though I called myself one my entire life.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:24.500]   Through Bruin, I learned a lot about who God was and how loving he actually is.
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.500]   I learned that God puts us through certain hardships to help us grow.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.500]   Most importantly, I learned that I'm a lowly sinner.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:35.500]   With all these truths, I started to reflect on my past and how sinful my actions in college were.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:40.500]   My heart started to soften, slowly letting go of the hatred I held toward God.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:45.500]   I started to remorse over hating him when he was so patient with me.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:50.500]   As I continued to attend Bruin, I turned to God and repented of my sin as a way of reconciliation.
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.500]   Life after coming to Christ has not been an easy one.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.500]   While I started praying more, reading the Bible more, and attending church regularly,
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.500]   I quickly learned that I was fulfilling my glory and not his.
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.500]   But I am reminded of Christ's sacrifice.
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.500]   Jesus loves us so much that he sacrificed himself for our sins.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:13.500]   As I am reminded of the truth, I learned that this life is not for me.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.500]   My purpose in life is to glorify God.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:21.500]   While I may stumble at times, I know now that I cannot return to living a secular life.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:27.500]   With my new identity in Christ, I want to have the right posture before him in all that I do and be obedient.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.500]   Rather than seeing going to church and praying to God as an obligation,
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:36.500]   I now desire to spend time with God because he is my loving father and to prioritize him in my life.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:40.500]   He is the one I turn to in times of hardships, in times of blessings,
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.500]   and I will continue to keep him at the center of my life and live my life for him.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.500]   Thank you.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:53.500]   [Applause]
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.500]   Megan, do you understand when you go into the water, you are being united to Christ's death,
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.500]   and when you come out, you are being united to his resurrected life?
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.500]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:33.500]   [Applause]
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.500]   Thank you, Megan, for that awesome testimony.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:42.500]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to 1 Thessalonians 4, verses 2-4.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:49.500]   This was meant to be a two-part sermon that turned into three because I didn't get to finish last week.
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.500]   So we have this, and then we'll do the other part next week.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:59.500]   1 Thessalonians 4, I'll be reading from verse 2-4.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:04.500]   "Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving,
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:10.500]   praying at the same time for us as well that God will open up to us a door for the Word,
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.500]   so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ for which I have also been imprisoned,
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.500]   that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak."
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.500]   Let's pray.
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.500]   Father, we pray for soft hearts.
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.500]   We pray for open ears.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.500]   We pray for a surrendered will,
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:37.500]   that your Word, Lord God, would not fall on hardened hearts
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.500]   or unwilling and rebellious spirit.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.500]   Help us, Lord God, to all be good soils,
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:48.500]   that as we receive your Word, that it may bear fruit 30, 60, and a hundredfold.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.500]   As you can see, our theme is going to be up here for the rest of the year
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.500]   because we want to continue to emphasize this.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:05.500]   And as I mentioned last week, we want to have a reputation.
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.500]   As we have a reputation of being a Bible teaching church,
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:16.500]   it's just as important that we grow in our commitment to prayer.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:21.500]   You know, some of you guys are maybe kind of goal-oriented people.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.500]   I'm naturally that way.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.500]   If there's a target, if there's somewhere I need to go,
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.500]   I try to figure out what's the fastest way to go.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.500]   And it's not something that I plan to do. It just happens.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.500]   It's just kind of my default nature.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.500]   Some of you guys are not like that. You just kind of linger.
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.500]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.500]   And so you're kind of used to coming five to ten minutes late on everything
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.500]   because you kind of get caught up in talking to people and whatever you're doing.
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.500]   But I'm kind of like, if I need to go there, I need to get there earlier.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.500]   And so I've noticed that when I leave the parking lot here at church,
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:56.500]   I just naturally, I automatically think, am I going to turn left or turn right?
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:00.500]   Because if I go turn left, that means I will take the 55 freeway
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.500]   and I get off at Edinger, and then sometimes that--
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.500]   usually that's the fastest route when there's no traffic.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.500]   And then depending on the time of the day, if I make it,
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.500]   if I get on that, there's going to be traffic,
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.500]   and I know there's some construction going on,
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.500]   so it's becoming more congested than normal.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.500]   So I will take Red Hill all the way down locally, and sometimes that's the fastest.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.500]   And then depending on the time of the day, if I make a right turn,
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.500]   there's a 405 that I get on, and I go down and get off on Culver.
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.500]   And then so even as I go, should I make a right turn?
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.500]   What time of the day is it? Is there traffic?
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.500]   Or is this light turning green, or is it red?
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.500]   And so even that split second, like I'm constantly thinking,
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.500]   if I make a right turn here, I'm going to get caught in this red light,
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.500]   so maybe if I make a left turn and go down straight, it'll be faster.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.500]   And if there's congested on Red Hill, I'll make a right turn on Gilbert,
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.500]   and I can go down to Jamboree, make a left, and then right turn on Alton,
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.500]   and then I can go down Harvard, and Harvard, that'll save me about 30 seconds.
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.500]   [laughter]
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.500]   And so I don't think like that by calculating.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.500]   It just happens.
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.500]   As soon as I get in the car, like which is the fastest way, which lane?
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.500]   So if I'm on the freeway, and I see that somebody's congested
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.500]   or is stepping on the brake maybe about a mile ahead,
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.500]   I'll make sure that I'm on the other lane.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:16.500]   If I got on the right lane, there's a lot of people getting on to the highway,
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.500]   and if they get on that, we're going to end up having to merge,
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.500]   and that's going to slow down the traffic,
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.500]   so I'm going to move to the next lane for a little bit,
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.500]   and then once I pass that, I can get back on that right lane.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.500]   So when I'm getting on it and I'm getting off the freeway,
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.500]   there's two ways to make a left turn, but if I stay on the left side,
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.500]   it's a little bit more congested than the right side, so I get on the right side.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.500]   But if I stay on the right side, the traffic coming off the freeway
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.500]   is going to merge onto that lane, so that's going to take me a little bit longer
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.500]   than if I stay on the left side.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.500]   So depending on what I see ahead of me, I'll be on the left side or the right side.
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.500]   And then whichever has the most traffic lights I try to avoid,
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.500]   and which is the fastest way?
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.500]   It probably only saves me about 15 seconds.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.500]   But that's just kind of how my brain's wired,
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.500]   so everything I do, I try to get from point A to point B as fast as possible,
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.500]   and the end result for all of that, I save 30 seconds,
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.500]   and I have many traffic tickets. [laughter]
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.500]   Because oftentimes I'm not paying attention to how I'm getting there,
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.500]   I just need to get there as fast as I can.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.500]   So I know there's a stereotype of men that don't ask directions,
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.500]   but I usually get lost because I--
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.500]   Now we have GPS, so you just follow what the GPS says,
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.500]   but a long time ago when we first got married,
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.500]   Esther's the opposite.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:33.500]   She does whatever she gets caught up in, and she just pays full attention to that.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.500]   And she may have an appointment 10 minutes later,
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.500]   and it's going to take her 30 minutes, but she doesn't realize until it's too late.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.500]   And so she's always a bit late.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.500]   But the good thing about that is she's always paying attention
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.500]   to what's right in front of her.
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.500]   And so when she tells me to make a left turn, I just make a left turn.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.500]   I don't argue with her.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.500]   Because I know that I don't pay attention to the road,
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.500]   and so she's much better at how to get somewhere.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:00.500]   So if we're headed somewhere, and Esther wants to drive--
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.500]   That's why when I drive, my kids ask me not to drive
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.500]   because I'm always herky-jerky in the car, and I don't know I'm doing that.
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.500]   And so they get car sick.
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.500]   They say, "We don't want Daddy driving because if he drives, we're going to get car sick."
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.500]   And in my mind, I'm thinking, like, "I'm not doing that,"
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.500]   but every time I turn around, they're sick.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.500]   [laughter]
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.500]   Now I share all of that because some of you may be like me.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.500]   You can relate to me, or maybe you're married to somebody like me,
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.500]   so you can relate to how my natural mind thinks.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.500]   Again, I don't do this on purpose. It just happens.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.500]   Now, there are certain things that this is good for.
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.500]   If you have a project that needs to be done,
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.500]   if you have goals that need to be met,
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.500]   if there's deadlines that you need to get--
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.500]   So somebody like me is good at getting something done.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:49.500]   We started a project. It just needs to get done.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:53.500]   But that type of way of thinking and carrying things out
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.500]   is detrimental in certain other areas,
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.500]   especially when it comes to people.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.500]   Because when it comes to people, people don't function like that.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:07.500]   We don't have timelines where you need to be this much maturity by this time,
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.500]   and I'm going to get you to work and get you to get to this point
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.500]   because then you start looking at people as projects.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.500]   And then if they don't meet up to that project,
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.500]   and they don't get that goal, then we failed.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.500]   But that's not how it works, and you can't raise children that way.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.500]   You can say, "Oh, by one, they should be talking, or walking.
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.500]   By two, they should be talking. By three, they should be reading."
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.500]   And then when they don't meet those criteria, it's like, "Oh, we failed.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.500]   Something's going on. We need to send them to after-school program."
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.500]   You're not going to be able to raise your children that way
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.500]   because people have different patterns of growth.
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.500]   When it comes to church, if we begin to apply--
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.500]   There are certain things that we can do like that,
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   but when we begin to apply and say, "Well, what is the end goal?
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.500]   Where are we trying to go?"
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:55.500]   And if our end goal is God wants this church to grow,
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.500]   we want it to be filled,
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.500]   then whatever means and the fastest way to get there
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.500]   is what we end up committing to.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.500]   And that's basically what happened in our generation.
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.500]   Whenever a church is planted, a goal has been set.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:12.500]   How do we get the most number of people fill these seats?
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.500]   And so the movement has said, "How do we market it
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:20.500]   so that we can get the point A, church plant, to point B, growth?"
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.500]   And if it is growing, no matter what's happening in the church,
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.500]   if it is growing, we're doing something right.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:30.500]   It is detrimental to the church because if you read Scripture,
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.500]   God didn't set us a goal to meet, saying that if you are a brand-new Christian,
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   by the time you're 5 years old as a Christian, you should be doing this.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.500]   By 10 years old, you should have done this.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.500]   By 15 years old, you should have done that.
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.500]   It doesn't set goals like that.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.500]   The Bible measures maturity by the means that we are taking
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.500]   to wherever it is God has taken us.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.500]   That's why you look at Scripture and you look at the Old Testament.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.500]   God tells them. He doesn't tell them, like, "I want you to get from here to point B.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.500]   You're in the desert. We need you to get here.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.500]   And the fastest route, you figure out how to get there."
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.500]   He doesn't do that.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.500]   He tells them, "When I tell you to get up, get up.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.500]   When I tell you to sit down, you sit down.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.500]   I tell you to touch this, you not to touch this, do exactly what I say."
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.500]   They go into the Promised Land.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.500]   They take a fortified city that they need to conquer.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:26.500]   And they take the general that has experience for 40 years leading the Israelites.
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.500]   And he just pops them out.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.500]   Puts a brand-new general in there.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.500]   They walk in, and don't give him any instruction other than,
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.500]   "Do not turn from my word to the left or to the right.
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.500]   If you want to be successful, do exactly what I tell you to do."
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.500]   And they say, "Well, what is it do you want me to do?"
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.500]   He said, "Pick up this box and walk."
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.500]   "What does this have to do with this army?"
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.500]   He said, "First day, go around in a circle.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.500]   Second day, circle. And the seventh day, run it around seven times."
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.500]   Where is he taking us?
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.500]   I mean, they become expert marchers.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.500]   I mean, that's what they did for 40 years.
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:08.500]   If there is anything that they're trained to do is to carry this box and march,
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.500]   they're not prepared for battle.
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.500]   They're not prepared to conquer this land.
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.500]   But that's exactly what he told them to do,
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.500]   because the end result was something he was going to do
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.500]   if they followed his instruction.
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.500]   We come to the New Testament, we find the exact same thing.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.500]   What God tells us, he didn't say, "Go conquer the world in my name."
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.500]   He didn't say that.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.500]   He said, "Do not turn from my word. Do not add to it. Do not take away from it."
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.500]   He says, "You will be my disciple when the Holy Spirit comes upon you."
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.500]   And then he says in John 15, he says, "I am the vine. You are the branches."
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.500]   "You cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me."
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.500]   So the primary thing that he was teaching his disciples is,
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.500]   "If you want to bear fruit, you need to abide in me."
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.500]   "You need to abide in me."
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:59.500]   So if our primary goal that God has called us to is his glory,
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:04.500]   the primary means which God has given us to glorify God
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:09.500]   is the teaching of the Word of God and to be devoted to prayer.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:13.500]   So no matter what you think, if you say, "You know what? We have this Christian. We want him to be here."
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.500]   And you are not devoted to prayer.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.500]   You're not achieving anything.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:22.500]   Even if there is a physical change.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.500]   If somebody who wasn't doing this is doing this.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.500]   That's not how the Bible teaches us about discipleship.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:35.500]   Discipleship in the Scripture teaches us about committing to his means.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:39.500]   Not be committed to the goal and how do we get to that goal.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.500]   It's the means is what glorifies God.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.500]   Because we don't know exactly where he's going to take us.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.500]   We don't know.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.500]   We may be wandering in the desert.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.500]   Maybe this means is going to lead you to jail.
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.500]   Maybe this means is going to lead you to sickness.
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.500]   Maybe this means is going to cause your church to shrink.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.500]   We don't know what God is playing.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.500]   How he's orchestrating and putting the pieces together.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.500]   Because only God controls the end result.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.500]   So the means, he said, do exactly what I say.
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.500]   And when you abide in me, my words abide in you.
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.500]   Ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you.
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.500]   In other words, he's going to do it.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.500]   He didn't give us to do it.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:21.500]   He said, he's going to do it if you abide in my means.
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.500]   That's why it's crucial for us.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.500]   As we are a church that has a reputation of being the word center.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:32.500]   We're nowhere near to that commitment when it comes to prayer.
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.500]   Again, that's my fault.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:38.500]   And so I want to continue to stress and emphasize.
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:42.500]   That even if it takes another 20 years.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.500]   That this is the right direction for us to go.
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.500]   That we need to continue to devote ourselves.
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.500]   Dr. A.T. Pearsons says about prayer.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:53.500]   There has never, and I don't think that's an overstatement.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.500]   There has never been a spiritual awakening in any country or locality.
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.500]   That did not begin in united prayer.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.500]   No amount of human effort.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.500]   No amount of commitment.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.500]   No amount of sacrifice.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.500]   No amount of know-how or organization.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.500]   Will accomplish God's work.
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:18.500]   Because God said, he will work when we are devoted to prayer.
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.500]   So if there's anything that we need to be devoted to.
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.500]   Is prayer, first and foremost.
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.500]   Before organizing.
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.500]   Before committing.
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.500]   Before identifying what needs to happen.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.500]   First and foremost, we need to be devoted to prayer.
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:38.500]   No revival comes where there isn't a devotion to prayer.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.500]   Not just sprinkling of prayer.
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.500]   Not just prayer so that we can say we did it.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.500]   But devotion to prayer.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:50.500]   There are so many books out there on the subject of prayer.
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:55.500]   Anybody who writes books, eventually, if you're studying the Bible, you can't avoid it.
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.500]   The Bible says you have to be devoted to prayer.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.500]   In every part of the Bible, Old Testament, New Testament, devoted to prayer.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:05.500]   So anybody who's Bible teaching will have to eventually write something about prayer.
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.500]   Because we know it's all that important.
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.500]   But to be devoted to prayer.
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.500]   We don't see much of that in our generation.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.500]   EM bounds.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:24.500]   If you're looking for a book, really committed to read a book on prayer, the one book that I really recommend is EM bounds, power through prayer.
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.500]   Now EM bounds, prayer, is a very thick book.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.500]   And he's as thorough as you can get on this subject of prayer.
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.500]   You don't have to read all of it, but there are certain sections.
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:40.500]   And my favorite section in his book of prayer is power through prayer.
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:44.500]   He basically challenges us about the power that comes through prayer.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.500]   How we tap into power, how God uses this power when we pray.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:50.500]   And here are some of the quotes that's in this book.
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:55.500]   What the church needs today is not more machinery or better.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:00.500]   Not new organizations or more and novel methods, but men whom the Holy Ghost can use.
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.500]   Let me stop right there.
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:08.500]   It sounds like he's talking about secret friendly movement today, but this was written many, many generations ago.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.500]   This was a constant challenge all throughout human history.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:21.500]   Even before the secret friendly movement that we become more reliant upon our resources and upon our strong effort and organization and know-how.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.500]   There's always been that temptation.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.500]   So EM bounds says that's not what we need.
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.500]   That's not what the Bible calls us for.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.500]   Men of prayer, men mighty in prayer.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.500]   The Holy Ghost does not flow through the methods, but through men.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.500]   He does not come on machinery, but on men.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.500]   He does not anoint plans, but men.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:44.500]   Men specifically of prayer.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:51.500]   God's work and His mighty work doesn't happen because we figured out how to do church.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:56.500]   That we figured out a new method of how to disciple people.
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:03.500]   He says the power in the church has always been when the Holy Spirit is ignited through devoted prayer.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:09.500]   The early church was not effective because they were better organized than we are today.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:14.500]   It's not because they are men who are more talented than today.
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.500]   More committed than we were today.
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:21.500]   The early church has power because the Holy Spirit was ignited.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.500]   And because they were devoted to prayer.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.500]   God was working, not men.
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.500]   It was God who was spreading the gospel, not men.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.500]   It was God who was discipling people, not men.
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:36.500]   It was when the Word of God got into people through the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:42.500]   through men who were devoted to prayer, where the gospel exploded.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:49.500]   Again, another part of this book says, "Talking to men for God is a great thing.
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.500]   But talking to God for men is greater still.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:45:02.500]   We will never talk well and with real success to men for God who has not learned well how to talk to God for men."
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:13.500]   To think that we are going to bring people to Christ through our strong effort is probably the biggest human arrogance.
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.500]   We can get people to come to church who are lonely.
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.500]   A sense of purpose. Come to church and have purpose.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:24.500]   Maybe people who want to be a part of a community. We can get them to come by our own effort.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.500]   We can get parents to bring their children.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.500]   If we have BBS and teach them morals and to obey their parents, we can get them to come.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:35.500]   We can fill this church with our own methods.
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:44.500]   If the sermon is pleasing enough, if people are friendly enough, if the church is organized enough,
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.500]   then we can get the church to come. We can get to the next level.
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:57.500]   But to think to get a sinner to abandon his whole life to follow Christ by our method is human arrogance at the core.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:03.500]   Christ didn't ask us, the people who didn't go to church, to come to church.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:10.500]   The gospel isn't people who are lonely to come and be part of a community where you have a hard time raising children.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:15.500]   So to come, so we're going to help you raise your children. That's not the core message of the gospel.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:27.500]   The core message of the gospel is that the foolishness of being in a rat race in and of itself is to be abandoned for a new life in Christ.
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:36.500]   A new life in Christ. All your ambition, all your desire, everything that you work for, all of that to be abandoned to find new life in Christ.
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:42.500]   And he tells us where our natural knee-jerk reaction is, I want to be successful.
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.500]   I want to retire at this age. I want to make this money. I want my children to have success.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.500]   I want to have this much in retirement. Our natural reaction is to pursue that.
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:56.500]   And Christ says, no. He who follows me must deny himself and pick up his cross and follow me.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:02.500]   He who wants to live, he must first die. He who finds his life will lose it.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:09.500]   He who loses his life for my sake will find it. You're going to convince a sinner to do that by your method?
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:16.500]   You're going to convince a sinner by organization, by hard work, by setting an example to them,
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:22.500]   that by your example that somebody is going to give up their life to follow Christ in that way? No.
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.500]   That's a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.500]   When the Word of God gets into somebody by the Spirit and the power of God.
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:34.500]   And that's why he says you must be devoted to prayer.
[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:41.500]   Any human endeavor that has not begun with devoted prayer is human arrogance.
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:45.500]   That I failed. I tried this method, it failed. So I'm going to try this other method.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:50.500]   I tried this and this isn't working. So maybe if we organize, if we taught differently,
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:55.500]   if we did community differently, that somehow we're going to get the end result.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:02.500]   No. The first and the most important thing that God calls us to do is to pray.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:09.500]   The means in which God is going to be glorified is do not turn from the Word to the left or to the right
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.500]   and to be devoted to prayer.
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:16.500]   There's two things that this says and this is a simple message.
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:24.500]   If devotion to prayer is this important, not point 1A, it's point 1, period,
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:29.500]   co-equal with turning to the Word and to prayer.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:34.500]   See, if you are committed to the Word of God and not committed to devoted prayer,
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:40.500]   it's kind of like, you know, today we live on the internet and we hear about what people said, right?
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:46.500]   And we get bits and pieces of what they've said and then they're attacked based upon their words.
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:52.500]   You know, in any courtroom, you could take pieces of things that they've said.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:59.500]   But in the courtroom, it doesn't just matter what they said, it matters what they meant.
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.500]   Their intent.
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:11.500]   So you can know the mind of God, the Word of God, and if you do not know the heart of God, you do not know God.
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:15.500]   If you study the Word of God without being devoted to prayer,
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:21.500]   you're nothing but a lawyer who is dissecting the Word of God and applying it in context
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.500]   and not being able to represent God.
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:32.500]   A man who is going to be an ambassador of Christ must know more than his word.
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:38.500]   If I come to you and all I am is regurgitating things that I've seen,
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:44.500]   let's say as an example, you know, I come to you and I'm sharing the Bible, sharing what the Word of God says.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:47.500]   The Bible says that if you don't repent, you're going to go to hell.
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:52.500]   And so you need to come to Christ and hear some facts and you do with it what you do with it.
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:59.500]   The Bible doesn't want people—God didn't call us to be regurgitators of information that we have received.
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:04.500]   God called us to be his witness, to be his ambassadors.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:11.500]   The Bible says he is pleading with sinners to reconcile with this holy God.
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:17.500]   You can understand the mind of God, but if you don't understand the heart of God,
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:21.500]   you're not going to be a good ambassador.
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:25.500]   You're just going to be dissecting information, disseminating information to people.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:30.500]   And you do with it what you do with it. A good ambassador understands the heart of God.
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:36.500]   If we are not broken for sinners on our knees, we cannot be broken for sinners theologically.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:44.500]   Because God did not send people just to tell them, "I said this, so you say this to them."
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:50.500]   We need to first and foremost be devoted in prayer so that we not only understand his Word,
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:54.500]   we need to understand his heart.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:51:01.500]   So that gospel goes forth, not just in word, but in heart.
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:05.500]   Where we plead with sinners to come to Christ.
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:14.500]   See, when we're not praying, we're thinking theologically, and you have a big brain that is useless.
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:20.500]   Because God didn't call us to be big brains. He called us to be his witness.
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:24.500]   So we must be devoted to prayer.
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:29.500]   Two things that hinder us in prayer. One is not staying alert.
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:34.500]   Not being sober. In NIV it's just translated to be awake.
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:41.500]   Jesus pleads with his disciples to stay awake and pray in Matthew 26, 41, when he's at the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:46.500]   To keep watching and praying that you may not enter into temptation.
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:50.500]   The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:54.500]   Now, humanly speaking, how many of us would be awake?
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:52:00.500]   We can read that and say, "Well, it's the middle of the night. They just had a Passover meal. It was a huge meal."
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:06.500]   I know at church when we eat, it's just because we're used to eating buffets.
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.500]   But a Passover meal was a feast.
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:15.500]   So they just had probably one of the biggest feasts of the year, and Jesus takes them to pray.
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.500]   That was the worst time to pray, in the middle of the night?
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:26.500]   And of course, Jesus was pleading. He comes back and he says, "Why couldn't you stay awake?"
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:34.500]   Well, there's a clear reason why they didn't stay awake, because they didn't see the seriousness, the urgency of the situation.
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.500]   Jesus was also a human being. I'm sure he was tired.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:40.500]   But the difference was Jesus knew what was coming next day.
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:45.500]   Every single one of us, every single one of us, right?
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:51.500]   Depending on what's in our head and in our heart, it'll cause us to sleep or not sleep.
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:57.500]   Every time somebody gets married on Friday night, you have a hard time sleeping.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:02.500]   The husband and wife or the bride and groom usually shows up to the wedding with bloodshot eyes.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:07.500]   Why not? I mean, it's a big day tomorrow. You should sleep.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.500]   You should sleep. You're going to be tired. You should sleep.
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:14.500]   But they can't sleep. Why not? Because a big day is coming.
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:18.500]   Maybe when you're young, right? Maybe those of you who are not married, you can't relate to that.
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:23.500]   But maybe when you're young, your parents promised you're going to go to Disneyland or Magic Mountain,
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:28.500]   or you're going to take this trip, or something's coming, or you're going to get a brand new car.
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:35.500]   Whatever it may be, you remember staying awake because something was happening the next day.
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:40.500]   The disciples had no clue. They should have, but they didn't.
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:45.500]   Jesus made it very clear. I'm going to get caught. I'm going to get beat. I'm going to die.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:49.500]   And I'm going to resurrect. And it's clear that they didn't understand.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:55.500]   Because when Jesus was, he gave himself, when he was crucified, they were confused.
[00:53:55.500 --> 00:54:00.500]   And that's why there was no sense of urgency to stay awake.
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:05.500]   Because they didn't understand. So the Bible pleads with us to be sober.
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:14.500]   1 Peter 4, 7, "The end of all things is near. Therefore be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer."
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:23.500]   In Luke 21, 34-36, it says, "Be on guard so that your heart will not be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life.
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:30.500]   And that day will not come upon you suddenly like a trap, for it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of the earth.
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:34.500]   But keep on the alert at all times."
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:38.500]   You notice there's three things that he mentions. Not to be weighed down by dissipation.
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:41.500]   Dissipation is just another word for sin.
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:45.500]   If you have ongoing sin in your life, you're not going to be able to pray.
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:49.500]   You're going to be weighed down. You're not going to be sober. He says, "Do not be weighed down by dissipation."
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:52.500]   Sin. Do not be weighed down by drunkenness.
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:58.500]   Drunkenness is not simply, drunkenness is with alcohol. Obviously that's included in that.
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:08.500]   But drunkenness is where the consumption of the world has caused you to be consumed and to be tempted by the things of the world.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:16.500]   And so you are drunk with the world and then when you come to God, you don't know what to say because your mind is completely somewhere else.
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:23.500]   When your mind and heart is headed toward another direction and then you come to God for prayer,
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:30.500]   you're not able to pray because your mind and your words naturally reflect what's on your heart.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:34.500]   So you're not going to come to prayer and say, "Lord, give me a Lamborghini. Give me this. Give me that."
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:42.500]   So you're trying to pray theologically correct while your mind and your heart is somewhere else.
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:49.500]   When you're not sober, you can't pray. You can put in the time to pray. You can check off and say the things.
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:59.500]   But true, effective prayer where we're coming and pleading for His will to be done, you cannot pray effectively when we're not sober.
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:05.500]   You cannot be weighed down by dissipation or drunkenness and simply the worries of life.
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:13.500]   Worries of life. And the greatest deception of the worries of life are not sinful.
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:18.500]   I'm just trying to be a good dad. I'm just trying to be a good mom.
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:23.500]   I was never tempted with money because I thought I committed my life to Christ and I'm going to do homeless ministry.
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:29.500]   So money was not something that I was pursuing until I had a kid.
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:35.500]   All of a sudden, all of a sudden, I wished I had money that I never thought about before.
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:43.500]   Driving my kid in a car with no air conditioning in the middle of summer and seeing him sweat and seeing other parents and getting their life escalates
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:47.500]   and going to the mall and buying stuff that they want for the kids.
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:53.500]   And for the first time, I was tempted. I wish I had more money.
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:59.500]   See, the things that weigh us down oftentimes are not sinful.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:08.500]   You say, well, it's for my kids. But every stage of your life, there is something that you say, well, I'm just trying to get a good job.
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:12.500]   I'm just trying to get married. I'm just trying to have kids. I'm just trying to raise my kids.
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:16.500]   I'm just trying to get them to the next level. I'm just trying to make sure that they're taken care of.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:22.500]   I'm just trying to prepare for retirement. I'm just trying to finish well. What's wrong with that?
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:29.500]   Right. There's nothing wrong with that, except if that's your primary pursuit.
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:38.500]   Our greatest distraction are not evil things. It's just that it's not meant to be our first love.
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:44.500]   He says, do not be weighed down with that, but keep on the alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things.
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:49.500]   First Peter 1, 13, "Therefore, prepare your minds for action. Keep sober in spirit.
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:54.500]   Fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:58.500]   To be completely fixated on what is coming.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:05.500]   See, our urgency to plead with the Lord is directly linked to our prayer life.
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:10.500]   You cannot come to a holy God casually.
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:16.500]   You cannot, you know, Martin Lloyd-Jones, probably one of my best favorite sermons on this subject,
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:21.500]   basically says that one of the most difficult things to do is to pray.
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:25.500]   It's the most simplest thing to do. You know, starting the Word of God, you need to dissect, ask questions,
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:30.500]   and look at the context, and understand the Greek, and the different theology, the systematic things.
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:33.500]   Well, studying the Bible is harder. I said, no.
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:38.500]   Praying is the hardest discipline because you cannot do it casually.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:45.500]   You cannot casually be entangled with this world and all of a sudden think you're going to have this prayer life.
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:51.500]   See, an individual who is not sober and pursuing and living each day, pursuing their own flesh,
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:57.500]   is not going to be able to come before God and plead for the things of God.
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:05.500]   I mean, imagine, you know, maybe some of you guys have experienced piano lessons, and you hated it.
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:12.500]   And then you come to your mom sarcastically, "Please, mom, can I practice more?"
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.500]   Because you know that that's what she wants to hear.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:21.500]   "Please, mom, can I stay longer and practice more? Two hours is not enough, four hours."
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:26.500]   And the only reason why you're saying that is because you think that's what your mom or your dad wants to hear.
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:33.500]   It's not a sincere plea. It goes against everything in the fiber of your being.
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:36.500]   You want to quit. You don't want to practice. You want this to give up.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:40.500]   You want her to change her mind so that she doesn't.
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:46.500]   But the only reason why you say it is because you know that's what she wants to hear.
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:52.500]   Much of our prayer when we're not sober and we are weighed down by the things of this world
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:57.500]   is coming to God pleading for things that we do not want.
[00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.500]   We don't want it.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.500]   "Your will be done." What if his will is pack up your bags and go overseas?
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.500]   What if his will is to not date this girl?
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.500]   What if his will is not to have this job?
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.500]   What if his will is for me to be sick?
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.500]   What if his will is for my children not to be taken care of?
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:20.500]   What if his will leads to hardship?
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:25.500]   So say, "Lord, your will be done, but not really."
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:30.500]   "Your kingdom come," this aspect, that aspect, but not this one.
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:36.500]   "On earth as it is in heaven, not completely though."
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.500]   That's why we can't pray.
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.500]   Because we haven't made up our mind.
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.500]   We haven't committed.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:49.500]   So you can study the Bible. You can come to church. You can even become a leader.
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:53.500]   You can even give eloquent sermons.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:01:00.500]   But you cannot pray until you are surrendered, until you are sober.
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:08.500]   Because you are standing and praying and kneeling before a holy God who knows all things.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.500]   We cannot come to the Lord casually.
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:14.500]   We need to be alert.
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:19.500]   You know, second reason why he says that we need to pray,
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:26.500]   he calls his disciples to pray, is because your spirit is willing, but your flesh is weak.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.500]   He knew what was going to happen to the disciples.
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:35.500]   When Peter says in Luke chapter 22, 31-34, he says, "Satan has asked permission to sift you like wheat."
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.500]   "But I pray that your faith will not fail you."
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.500]   You remember what Peter said?
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.500]   Not me.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.500]   Yeah, Andrew, I don't trust that guy.
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.500]   Lazarus.
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.500]   You know, Philip.
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.500]   What's he doing?
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.500]   Matthew, tax collector? That guy is going to turn back.
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500]   I never trusted that guy anyway.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.500]   Me? Not me.
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:02.500]   But Jesus says, "No, you are."
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.500]   You are.
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.500]   But I'm going to give you a second chance.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:10.500]   When you get back up, feed my sheep.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.500]   Peter meant what he said.
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.500]   He was loyal.
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.500]   That's one thing about Peter that I appreciate.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.500]   He meant what he said.
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:23.500]   Even though he fails more than anybody else, at least the record of his failure is more obvious to us than anybody else,
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.500]   but he meant what he said.
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:30.500]   So when, at the Garden of Gethsemane, the temple guards came to get him,
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:34.500]   we're not talking about just a handful of people, it's a small army that came to get him.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.500]   Peter took out his knife and was ready to fight.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:42.500]   But the reason why he started getting scared is because he didn't understand why did Jesus give himself up.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:49.500]   He trusted. I mean, he walks on water, he calms the storm, he feeds 5,000.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.500]   So as long as I'm on his side, I can fight. He's going to do something.
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:57.500]   But when Jesus gave himself up, his paradigm shifted and I don't get him.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.500]   And then fear crept in.
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:07.500]   And then when fear crept in and it was left to his flesh, he cowered and he denied Christ three times.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.500]   That's what Jesus meant.
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:16.500]   You may be willing, but your flesh is weak.
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:21.500]   No matter how determined you are, no matter how smart, no matter how much experience you have,
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:25.500]   no matter how much knowledge that you think you have, no matter how much success you've had in the past,
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:35.500]   all of that, all of that becomes your Achilles heel because it's filled your head with pride.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:45.500]   The worst thing that can happen to a Christian is to experience some level of success without humbling ourselves to pray.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:50.500]   Because the natural thing that happens to every one of us, as soon as we make a little money,
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:55.500]   as soon as we have a little bit of success, as soon as we bear a little fruit,
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.500]   what did I do right?
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:05.500]   And how can I repeat that? And how can I tell other people to do the same?
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:09.500]   The greatest hindrance to our spiritual growth is pride.
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:15.500]   And as soon as a little bit of pride gets in, we are ruined.
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:22.500]   And that's why he says, "To pray, if my people humble themselves and pray,
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:27.500]   so that when God answers prayer, we know he did it."
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:35.500]   Not because of effective preaching, not because of organization, not because of strong willpower or discipline,
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:41.500]   not because of some method, not because of some organization, not because of rich donors,
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:47.500]   not because of location, because God had mercy on us.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:52.500]   Because we humbled ourselves and we prayed.
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:57.500]   "You may be willing," he says, "but your flesh is weak."
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:03.500]   In 1 Thessalonians 5:18, "In everything give thanks, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:12.500]   The second thing that he tells us is not that we need to be thankful.
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:21.500]   A grumbling spirit, a grumbling spirit directly affects the way we pray.
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:26.500]   In Hebrews 13, 15, it says, "Through him, then, let us continually offer up sacrifice of praise to God.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:30.500]   That is the fruit of the lips that give thanks to him."
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:37.500]   Fruit of our salvation is lips that give thanks to his name.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:40.500]   You read that?
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:46.500]   The fruit of our salvation is not simply hard work.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:52.500]   The fruit of our salvation is not simply point A to point B.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:55.500]   It's praise.
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:58.500]   It's praise.
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.500]   It's thankfulness.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:10.500]   How much time do we spend complaining about not getting from point A to point B?
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:16.500]   When God never, we don't know what the point B looks like.
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:21.500]   Point B is we don't know where God has taken us.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:32.500]   I could be as faithful as possible, preach the word of God, and be devoted to prayer, and all of you leave one day.
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.500]   You say, "Well, I'm not sure about that."
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.500]   Look at church history.
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.500]   Look at church history.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:43.500]   The people who suffered the most were the most faithful.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:47.500]   People who died were the faithful.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:52.500]   The people who were the most persecuted were the most faithful.
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.500]   It's not the most faithful who had the greatest churches.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:59.500]   It's not the most faithful who had the biggest churches.
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:09.500]   Look at church history. The ones who were the most faithful suffered the most.
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:20.500]   If our thankfulness is contingent upon our circumstance and what we are surrounded by, you will always have a reason to grumble.
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.500]   Let me give you an illustration.
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:28.500]   Let me give you reasons to grumble.
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.500]   I don't want you guys to be offended by this.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:35.500]   I'm just giving you a heads up.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:43.500]   Some of you are very good looking, which means some of you are not.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.500]   Right?
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:49.500]   Some of you think, "Oh, yeah, he talked about me."
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.500]   I talked about you on both.
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.500]   Right?
[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.500]   Does it make you nervous?
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.500]   It's truth.
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:03.500]   I mean, for some reason, it's not politically correct to say what we observe.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:07.500]   Some of you are very tall.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.500]   Some of you are short.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.500]   Some.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:12.500]   Right?
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500]   Myself.
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.500]   Some of you have a nice looking nose.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:22.500]   Some of you can barely breathe.
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:23.500]   Oh, you're offended.
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.500]   I mean to offend you.
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.500]   Right?
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:28.500]   Some of you have a full set of hair.
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.500]   Some of you guys don't.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.500]   Some of you have very nice skin.
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:36.500]   Some of you do not.
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.500]   Some of you are perfect weight.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.500]   Some of you guys are not.
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.500]   Let me go further than that.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:44.500]   Some of you guys come from very wealthy homes.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:48.500]   You get married and you got a house the first day you're married.
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.500]   Some of you guys are barely able to pay for the wedding.
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.500]   That's not fair.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:58.500]   Some of you guys got into great colleges and some of you guys couldn't.
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:02.500]   Some of you guys have great jobs, paying your money.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:03.500]   God answered prayer.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:04.500]   Glory to God.
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.500]   But some of you could not.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.500]   And you have low paying jobs.
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:10.500]   Some of you guys can't afford a Tesla.
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.500]   Some of you guys can't get new tires.
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:17.500]   If you want reasons to grumble, we have plenty.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.500]   Right?
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.500]   We have plenty.
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:22.500]   Why?
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.500]   Why this?
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.500]   Why did God make me like this?
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.500]   Why God put me in this family?
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.500]   Why this job?
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.500]   How come these people?
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.500]   How come these leaders?
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:36.500]   If you want to grumble, I can give you a long list of things that you probably have already in your heart.
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:37.500]   Life's not fair.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.500]   You didn't choose that.
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:39.500]   You didn't do that.
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.500]   It just happened to you.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.500]   You were born that way.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:42.500]   You were born into that family.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:46.500]   You were born into your parents.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:59.500]   But remember, as Christians, all that grumbling is happening in the context of God sending His only begotten Son.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:11.500]   All that grumbling and complaining of what you don't have is in the context of the Son of God absorbing your filth upon Himself.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:20.500]   The punishment that you and I deserve, He, this holy, holy, magnificent, beautiful God, chose to give His only begotten Son
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:29.500]   and soak up our sins so that we can have this eternal hope no matter how ugly this world becomes.
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.500]   At the end of all of this, we have eternity with Him.
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:41.500]   So our complaining about whatever it is we're complaining about is within the context of what we have in Christ.
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:50.500]   So if you choose to be a grumbler, you choose to be a complainer, it's within that context.
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:54.500]   And maybe some of you think your grumbling is righteous.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:59.500]   Maybe some of you think your complaining is holy.
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:06.500]   When He says, "Be thankful in all things," He didn't give a contingency.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:11.500]   Because what God desires more than anything else in our lives is what?
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.500]   To worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:20.500]   And the reason why He says, "Do all things without grumbling," is because you cannot worship and grumble at the same time.
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:27.500]   You cannot. You cannot come and say, "God, You are so wonderful. You are so great. I don't deserve any of this."
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:33.500]   You cannot be saying that and at the same time, "But why did You make me like this?
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:37.500]   Why did You put me in this circumstance? Why are these people who are around me like this?"
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:43.500]   That's not worship. You cannot worship God. It's impossible.
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:53.500]   So a spiritual and mature person is not somebody who has figured out the fastest path to get from point A to point B.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:59.500]   The most mature person is the person who has seen the beauty of the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:03.500]   And the rest of his life, he lives in praising God.
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:14.500]   And that's why He says, "If you're not sober, and if you're not thankful in your heart for what you already have in Christ, you cannot pray."
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:19.500]   Because fundamentally, your attitude toward God is off.
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:27.500]   Fundamentally, what God desires of us more than anything else in our life is for us to praise His name for what He has done.
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:40.500]   Because what has happened, what is the core problem of mankind because of our sins is we fell short of the glory of God.
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:51.500]   So the primary work of taking away our sin is to behold His glory and to worship Him for eternity.
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:13:00.500]   And the only reason why we look forward to eternity is because we are so enamored with Him today that we want more of it in eternity.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:07.500]   God did not call us because He needed us to do His job.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:12.500]   And He's not asking us to do this because He lacked money, He lacked resources.
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:16.500]   No, He wants our praise.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:20.500]   A grumbling person is not a growing person.
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:25.500]   A grumbling person is not a praying person.
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:30.500]   First and foremost, God calls us to be prayerful, to be devoted to pray.
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:35.500]   Because we believe Romans 8.28, and we know that God causes all things to work together for good.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:39.500]   To those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.500]   The question is, do you believe that?
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:46.500]   Because the root of grumbling is unbelief.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:50.500]   Because the root of grumbling is something went wrong.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:53.500]   Something isn't right. The root of grumbling.
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:14:02.500]   But we recognize if we spend all our time on things that we cannot control, we have to recognize that God is in control.
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:07.500]   And God works all together, even the things that we don't understand.
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:14.500]   So as a result of that, we give Him praise for good and what we perceive to be bad.
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.500]   Because God is sovereign.
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:25.500]   So at the root of discontent is unbelief.
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:33.500]   So the most important thing that we need to do in this church is to praise God.
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:40.500]   Praise God. To worship God. To honor God.
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:45.500]   Not to get to the house the fastest I can.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:49.500]   Not to turn left because that's the fastest path.
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:54.500]   This is the quickest path. It has the best roads. No.
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:15:00.500]   What God desires is while you're in that car, that you're praising Him.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:05.500]   Whether you show up 30 minutes late, 10 minutes late, but that you're praising Him.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.500]   Or serving.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:11.500]   You know, last week, the ttukguk thing could have been a disaster.
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:17.500]   And maybe some of you guys would say, "Oh, it didn't taste. I had some ttukguk down the street and it was way better than this."
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.500]   Right?
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:23.500]   So if you have a discontent spirit, you're going to find something wrong.
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:26.500]   But man, I was encouraged.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.500]   I don't want to embarrass our sister Rachel.
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:34.500]   But I was anxious for her because there's a potential for this to be a disaster.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.500]   And I wasn't concerned about you necessarily.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:43.500]   Because there's always some people who's going to point out, "That flavor is not right. It's not enough salt. The ttuk was not..."
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:46.500]   There's always going to be somebody. So I expect some of that.
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.500]   And which I heard some of it.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:51.500]   My concern was not for you. That, "Oh, you're not going to like it."
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:55.500]   I can give you the best ttukguk and I know there's going to be some grumbling.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:16:00.500]   I was really more concerned for her that at the end of this, she's going, "I'm never going to do this again."
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:04.500]   You know? It's like, "Ah, man, I was here all week. Nobody came to help out."
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:07.500]   You know, "Sunday, they didn't pick up."
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:15.500]   And some people mentioned something, you know, "After all the effort and sacrifice you made, somebody said the ttuk wasn't soft enough."
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.500]   That's what I was concerned about at the end of it.
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.500]   That's why I kept on checking, "Are you okay? Do you need help? Are you okay? Do you need help?"
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:24.500]   But man, was I encouraged.
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:28.500]   First of all, so many people actually volunteered and helped.
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:32.500]   But at the end of the day, she was praising God.
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:38.500]   So many people helped out. And in my mind, it's like, "I don't know if that many people helped."
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:43.500]   But at the end of the day, it led to praise.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:47.500]   So what we ate wasn't the ttukguk.
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:54.500]   What we ate was fellowship, was praise, encouragement.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:58.500]   It doesn't matter how the ttuk tasted. It built the church.
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:04.500]   What God wants from us is praise, was worship.
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:14.500]   And that's why it says, "You cannot be effectively devoted to praying if you're constantly rumbling about something."
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:20.500]   We need to be a church that is devoted to praying.
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:26.500]   That we need to be the proper ambassadors of Christ, understanding His mind and His heart,
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:31.500]   so that the primary thing that the world is missing—
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:35.500]   You say, "Oh, you know, like fellowship." That's what they're missing.
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:38.500]   The primary thing is the purpose, right?
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:41.500]   We need to give them purpose. That's not what they're missing.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:48.500]   The primary thing that they're missing is God and fellowship with God.
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:52.500]   God created us not to be worshiped, but to be worshipers.
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:57.500]   And when we feel alive is when we are worshiping the most.
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:04.500]   What's going to bring non-Christians to the church is not well-behaved people.
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:07.500]   That's not what draws people to church.
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:10.500]   "Oh, you know, these people are so moral." "Oh, they're so moral over here."
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:13.500]   You know who's really moral? The Pharisees.
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:16.500]   Not everything they did was wrong.
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:22.500]   People are not attracted just because you behave better.
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:28.500]   In fact, some of the most miserable people to be around are people who are proper about everything.
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:31.500]   You know what I mean? Is it just me?
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:34.500]   Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:39.500]   People who, like, it just, you just feed off of their energy.
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:44.500]   You just love being around them. It's not simply because they're proper.
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:47.500]   It's because they love Christ.
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:52.500]   They love Christ with all our brokenness, with all our failures, with all our weakness.
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:57.500]   They fell in love with Christ, and they want you to fall in love with Christ, too.
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:00.500]   And it's just enjoyable to be around people like that.
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:05.500]   Because you come out of that fellowship wanting to know Christ, too.
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:09.500]   Not, "I better do better."
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:12.500]   Doing better is good. Don't get me wrong.
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:19.500]   But doing better comes as a result of praising God, first and foremost.
[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:27.500]   So this year, as we devote ourselves to pray, I want to give you some practical things to be devoted.
[01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:30.500]   So I don't want you to be like, "Yes, we need to be devoted to pray."
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:34.500]   Let's see what the leaders do.
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:40.500]   As corporately, what we're going to do is we're going to re-implement prayer and fasting in our church.
[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:44.500]   And this is something that we used to do a year ago, and it kind of fizzled out, and we want to reintroduce that.
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:48.500]   And so we're going to talk more about that at our members meeting, how that's going to be implemented.
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:51.500]   And so as corporately, we're going to pray.
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.500]   And we're looking into more ways to get you to pray.
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.500]   We're thinking about turning a room.
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:03.500]   I've identified a room that we can turn into a prayer room that you can access whenever you want.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:04.500]   And these are for the members.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:08.500]   We'll give you a code to get in, and if you want to come, even if we're not here.
[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:13.500]   We're trying to build a room, at least, whether it's used or not, we want to at least dedicate a room for that.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:17.500]   So if you come to church and just you want to go to that room and pray, we're going to have that.
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:20.500]   So there are some things that we're working on corporately.
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:24.500]   But more importantly, like you individually.
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:29.500]   So I want to give you some practical things to take as we wrap up this morning.
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:33.500]   Determine when and where you will pray.
[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:38.500]   If you make an application and said, "I want to be a better Christian," well, what does that mean?
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.500]   Anybody here who doesn't want to be a better Christian?
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:43.500]   Raise your hand if you don't want to be a better Christian.
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:44.500]   Anybody?
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:48.500]   You came into this room determined not to be a better Christian.
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:49.500]   Nobody.
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.500]   Anybody here is determined not to pray?
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.500]   Anybody determined not to pray?
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:54.500]   No.
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:57.500]   Everybody wants to be more spiritual.
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.500]   Everybody wants to grow in their faith.
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:03.500]   But if that's where we end, you're not going to apply it.
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.500]   So the question is, you've got to go to the next step.
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:08.500]   If that's the case, what do I have to do?
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:12.500]   So determine when and where you're going to pray.
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.500]   If you just say, "I'm going to pray," you're not going to pray.
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:19.500]   You have to first determine right on paper when is this going to happen.
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.500]   Pray when you're the most alert.
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:26.500]   Don't say, "You know, after I take care of all this and kids are down and we wash them
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:32.500]   and then, you know, when you're dead tired, you have like 15, 30 minutes before you pass out,
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.500]   I have some time there."
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.500]   It's like, that's exactly what you're going to do.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:36.500]   You're going to pass out.
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.500]   That's not the best time to pray.
[01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.500]   When is the best time to pray?
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.500]   When you're the most alert.
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.500]   You say, "Oh, when we're most alert, I've got to take care of this job.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.500]   I've got to cook.
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:46.500]   I've got to take care of the kids."
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:51.500]   Well, devoting yourself to pray means that that time belongs to God.
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.500]   Do it when that's – and then you can take care of other stuff.
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:55.500]   So when are you going to pray?
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:58.500]   When are you the most alert?
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:01.500]   So if you're a morning person, wake up a little bit earlier.
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:07.500]   If you're always with people, how can you break away from that?
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.500]   Pray when you are not distracted.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:13.500]   I know some people say, "I pray when I'm driving."
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:17.500]   It's like, I'm not saying that that's not prayer, but you're not devoted to prayer when you do that
[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:20.500]   because your mind is maybe like me.
[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:26.500]   I pray when I'm driving because I've got to figure out the fastest path to go home.
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:29.500]   You're not effectively praying when you're just praying casually.
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.500]   So when are you not distracted?
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.500]   When is the best time?
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.500]   Pray when you have time to pray.
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:45.500]   So if you have to go to work at 5 and then you get up and, you know, I'm going to pray from 425 to 430.
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:48.500]   When you don't have time or you're busy or in between.
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:53.500]   You know, I have lunch and I have an appointment at 1, I have an appointment at 12, and I'm going to pray, you know, 20 minutes in between.
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:58.500]   It's like, I'm not saying that you can't do that, but you're going to be rushed.
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:01.500]   So commit yourself to a time when you have time to pray.
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.500]   Maybe you're more alert at night.
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:04.500]   Who knows?
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:08.500]   But devote yourself and determine that time.
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:11.500]   Prepare yourself to pray.
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:18.500]   You're not going to watch series on Netflix like three in a row and say, OK, let's pray.
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:19.500]   Your heart's not ready for prayer.
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.500]   Your mind is on something else.
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.500]   So prepare yourself to pray.
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.500]   Read a book.
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.500]   E.M. Bounds.
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.500]   There's plenty of books that you can read on prayer.
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.500]   We'll give you some suggestions so you can pray.
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:34.500]   Read articles, hear sermons on the subject of prayer where your heart is being ready for prayer.
[01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:37.500]   So prepare yourselves.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.500]   Write it down.
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:42.500]   If your mind tends to wander and you have a hard time, so sit down and say, these are the things I need to pray for,
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:47.500]   so that if your mind begins to wander, you can look at that list and that will kind of take you through.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:55.500]   And make sure that your mind and your heart is engaged in prayer and you have enough time to pray when you're not distracted
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:24:01.500]   and you have a devoted time of praying, and then find other people to pray with.
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:08.500]   Especially if you're not used to the discipline of prayer, it helps tremendously to pray with people.
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:12.500]   Pray with especially somebody you think is very good at that.
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:19.500]   So if you're not used to praying, even five minutes, you'll probably check in your watch every 30 seconds.
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:27.500]   But if you pray with a prayer warrior, 10, 20, an hour could go by and you feed off the energy of the other person.
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:32.500]   So even if that's not the case, find somebody to pray with.
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:37.500]   And so to be devoted to prayer isn't simply wanting to pray.
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.500]   You have to calculate.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:40.500]   You have to commit.
[01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:43.500]   You have to get yourself so that you can pray.
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:51.500]   So we're hoping that at the end of this year, not just what we're doing in leadership, but as a church,
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.500]   that we would recognize how important this is.
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:59.500]   And if we don't make progress, we're going to keep pushing this direction.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:09.500]   And as I said, we've emphasized the Word of God to the extent that this is our weakness.
[01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:10.500]   We've been busy.
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:17.500]   It wasn't because we haven't been busy in the Lord's work, but we've been busy and we've kind of got lopsided.
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.500]   And this is not just one of many important things.
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.500]   It is crucial.
[01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:30.500]   If our church continues to grow and seemingly bear fruit without being devoted to prayer,
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.500]   we are just waiting for disaster to happen.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:42.500]   Because if God loves us, he will discipline us to make sure that we know that this is not our work.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.500]   This is his work.
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.500]   So let's be devoted to prayer.
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:57.500]   Let's pray.
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:03.500]   Heavenly Father, you know our weakness.
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:07.500]   You know our blind spots, Lord God, better than we do.
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:10.500]   Help us as a church to be devoted to prayer.
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:15.500]   Not just to pray, not just to begin in prayer and end in prayer,
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:19.500]   but be devoted to prayer as we are devoted to your Word.
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:25.500]   Individually, corporately, whether we are brand new Christians or we've been walking with you for many years,
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:30.500]   whether we are disciplined in prayer or whether we are just beginning,
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:35.500]   help us, Lord God, to continue to deepen our time with you,
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:40.500]   that we would not simply understand your mind, but your very heart.
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:51.500]   Help us to understand how you plead with us to plead on the behalf of the lost.
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:27:00.500]   As Christ reminded his disciples as he saw the multitudes, there are sheep without shepherds,
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:04.500]   how the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:11.500]   But as you called us to plead, plead to you to send out more workers,
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:16.500]   that before we raise workers, before we develop workers,
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:22.500]   that we would be devoted to pray, urging, Father God, that you to send more workers.
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:28.500]   So for that end, we pray that 2023, that you would push us, guide us, rebuke us,
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:32.500]   and establish us so that we would be a household of prayer.
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:35.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:38.500]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:41.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.500]   Your glorious cause.
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:20.500]   Your glorious cause, O God, engages our hearts.
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:29.500]   May Jesus Christ be known wherever we are.
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:37.500]   We ask not for ourselves, but for your renown.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:47.500]   The cross has saved us, so we pray, your kingdom come.
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:52.500]   Let your kingdom, let your kingdom come.
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:29:05.500]   Let your will be done, so that everyone might know your name.
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:13.500]   Let your song be heard everywhere on earth,
[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:20.500]   till your sovereign work on earth is done.
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:24.500]   Let your kingdom come.
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:31.500]   Give us your strength.
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:39.500]   Give us your strength, O God, encourage to speak.
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:48.500]   Perform your wondrous deeds through those who are weak.
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:56.500]   Lord, use us as you would, whatever the test.
[01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:07.500]   By grace we'll preach your gospel to our dying breath.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:11.500]   Let your kingdom come.
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:24.500]   Let your will be done, so that everyone might know your name.
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:32.500]   Let your song be heard everywhere on earth,
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:39.500]   till your sovereign work on earth is done.
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.500]   Let your kingdom.
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:45.500]   Let your kingdom come.
[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:57.500]   Let your will be done, so that everyone might know your name.
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:06.500]   Let your song be heard everywhere on earth,
[01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:13.500]   till your sovereign work on earth is done.
[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:16.500]   Let your kingdom come.
[01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:26.500]   That's great.
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:31.500]   Psalm 100.
[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:34.500]   Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth.
[01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:36.500]   Serve the Lord with gladness.
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:38.500]   Come before him with joyful singing.
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:40.500]   Know that the Lord himself is God.
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:43.500]   It is he who has made us and not we ourselves.
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:46.500]   We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:51.500]   Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:52.500]   Give thanks to him.
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:55.500]   Bless his name, for the Lord is good.
[01:31:55.500 --> 01:32:02.500]   His loving kindness is everlasting and his faithfulness to all generation.
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:08.500]   I pray, Father God, that you would fill our hearts with thankfulness and joyfulness and praise.
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:14.500]   That our praise in your name would not stop with these walls.
[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:17.500]   Help us, Lord God, wherever you send us.
[01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:20.500]   That we would be the aroma of Christ.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:26.500]   That we would adore you, love you, proclaim you wherever we go.
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:31.500]   May Christ and his name and his glory be magnified this week.
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:32.500]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:33.500]   Amen.

[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:56.500]   Jesus, he came to love, heal and forgive.
[01:32:56.500 --> 01:33:07.500]   He lived and died to buy my pardon.
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:18.500]   An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:29.500]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:40.500]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:51.500]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:34:02.500]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:03.500]   Amen.
