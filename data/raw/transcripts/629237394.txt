[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.240]   Good morning, my name is Colson. I'm a junior in the college ministry and this is my testimony.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.320]   I was born in Korea and adopted into a Christ-loving family when I was around six months old. So
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.060]   as I look back, God's plan for my salvation started right off the bat, but I was blind
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.200]   and my heart was too hardened to realize it. I spent my whole life going to church, but
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.960]   the whole time I was just going through the motions. I was even baptized when I was in
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.560]   fifth grade, but I was way too young to realize what it truly meant. As I got older, I had
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.360]   all the head knowledge that someone who grew up in the church should have, but it wasn't
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.320]   for the right reasons. I knew all the right answers and what to say during discussions
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.680]   and Bible study, but of course the knowledge I gained was for my own self-righteousness
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.320]   so that I could look like a good Christian to others, but it wasn't for God's glory.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.960]   I knew about all about God on the surface, but I didn't have a personal relationship
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.000]   with him. Because of this, I struggled with surrendering my life fully to Christ and giving
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.480]   up all I have to him. I would still go to church on Sundays and Bible studies on Fridays,
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.640]   but throughout the week, I took the mask off and lived as if there was no God. To me, Sundays
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.320]   and Fridays were times to see my friends, not a time to worship Christ. I lived very
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.440]   selfishly regarding my free time and I wouldn't ever do devotions or read the Bible on my
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.080]   own. Prayer was a rare thing in my life and I only really prayed when I felt like I needed
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.520]   it to. To me, God was like a genie in a bottle. My pride also got in the way as I felt like
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.480]   I needed to do something in order for me to be saved. I never doubted that God existed
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.480]   or thought the Bible was false, but I was much more interested in the empty promises
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.080]   of the world than giving my life to Christ. One of the biggest turning points in my life
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.800]   and one of the things I am most thankful for is when God led me to Berean. That's when
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.240]   I truly started to learn about who God really is and what that meant for me. Because of
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.080]   my pride, as I learned about the attributes of God, one of the things I struggled with
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.120]   the most was God's abundant mercy and grace. How could a perfect and holy God love a sinner
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.320]   like me? I always thought that I didn't deserve God's love and that there was no way I deserved
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.780]   to be saved. The funny thing was, I was absolutely correct. If God saves me, I have to do or
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.880]   give him something in return, I thought. Again, my pride wouldn't let me get over the fact
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.640]   that there was nothing I could do to help even a tiny bit with my salvation. It didn't
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.400]   happen overnight, but my mindset started to shift as I realized how broken I was and how
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.240]   much I needed God. In return, all I can give back is praise and gratitude. His love for
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.680]   me has inspired an overflow of worship and adoration as well as longing to learn more
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.840]   about Christ and his word. Experiencing God's love drove me to do daily things that I've
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.080]   never thought about doing before, such as spending time in his word and worshiping on
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.280]   my own time. I spent more time praying throughout the day as it felt more natural to go to God
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.960]   even when I wasn't in a dire situation. Doing these things no longer felt like something
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.320]   I had to do, but rather something I was lucky to be able to do, which filled me with joy.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.040]   Over the summer, some of the college ministry did a Bible reading plan of the Old Testament.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.840]   It was a fast-paced test of obedience, but it really helped me get a better grasp of
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.840]   who our God is. His incredible patience stuck out to me as I read about Israel sinning against
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.080]   God time and time again. The God of Israel is the same patient God that waited for me
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.240]   to surrender myself and let him in. It isn't from the Old Testament, but a verse I find
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.800]   really encouraging is 2 Peter 3.9. "The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some count
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.240]   slowness what is patient towards you, not wishing for any to perish, but for all to
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.920]   come to repentance." This verse really showed me God's goodness and that he will never give
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.120]   up on you, for he doesn't wish for anyone to be subject to his judgment in wrath. I've
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.640]   been rejecting God through my whole life, and he's been waiting for me to let go of
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.760]   the world and completely surrender to him. I've accepted that I'm completely undeserving
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.360]   of God's grace, but I rejoice now because I know God and I'm able to have a relationship
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.360]   with him. Thank you.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:10.360]   [applause]
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:30.360]   [inaudible]
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:39.360]   [applause]
