[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   And I want to read from verse 16 all the way down to verse 25, although we're going to
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.440]   be mainly focused on one verse, verse 18.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.620]   But I want to read from verse 16 all the way to verse 25, just so that we can get a little
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.620]   bit of context.
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:24.120]   Okay, 1 Timothy, sorry, Romans chapter 1, 16 through 25.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.160]   Reading out of the ESV, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.200]   for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, 'The
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.620]   righteous shall live by faith.'
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.240]   For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.120]   of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.400]   For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.320]   For his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.000]   perceived ever since the creation of the world in the things that have been made, so they
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.800]   are without excuse.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.360]   For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.760]   became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.520]   Claiming to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.080]   images resembling mortal men and birds and animals and creeping things.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.080]   Therefore God gave them up in the lust of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.320]   of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.040]   and worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator, who is blessed forever.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.040]   Amen."
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.680]   Let's pray.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:45.520]   Gracious Father, we ask for your grace this morning as we come to examine your word, to
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.400]   discern, Lord God, your will and your purpose.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.760]   Help us, Lord God, to have a deepening and deepening understanding, Lord God, of what
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.760]   it is that we have in you, that we would learn to love you and to honor and glorify you,
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.040]   that you would examine our hearts, Lord God, this morning to see if there's any hurtful
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.520]   ways in us, that your word would do its work to judge the thoughts and intentions of our
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.280]   heart that we may honor and glorify you.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.400]   Last week we looked at verse 15 and 16 and 17, talking about the power of the Gospel
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   and how in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.680]   And then we had that powerful statement that is repeated in three separate times in the
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.880]   New Testament, a passage that again is quoted from Habakkuk, "The righteous shall live by
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.200]   faith."
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.120]   We talked about how starting from verse 18, Paul's going to jump into the heart of the
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.760]   Gospel message.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.560]   So if somebody asks you, "Well, what's Christianity about?
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.560]   What is the Gospel?"
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.800]   Maybe those of you who are Christians or young Christians or even mature Christians, to really
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.840]   dive into the depth of what Paul has to say, because this is basically Christianity 101.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.520]   So he's going to jump into it, but one of the first things that we have to ask ourselves
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.400]   is why are we saved by faith?
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.600]   Let me cause you to think that one more time.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.240]   Why are we saved by faith?
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.440]   Because everything else that we do in life, we are taught and we believe that you have
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.840]   to work for it.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.280]   Now if you have any friend who is saying, "You know what?
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.500]   I don't really need to work hard because I got this special number that I had in my dream
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.400]   and I know that if I pick these numbers I'm going to win the lottery."
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.160]   And this guy's been playing this, you know?
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.280]   So he's just hoping to hit it big.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.520]   Or maybe a student who's at school and he's dropping out all of his classes because he's
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.560]   trying to make the next social media thing and he's going to become a billionaire.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.320]   And he wants a quick road to get to fame and fortune.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.380]   Ever since we're young, we're taught you have to work hard to get what you want.
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.160]   So if you're a student, you have to work hard to get good grades.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.000]   If you're an athlete, you have to practice hard.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.640]   If you're a student, you're again working hard to get good grades so you can get a good
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.640]   job.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.000]   If you have a good job, you have to work hard to get ahead and maybe get more money and
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.280]   advance in your career.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.900]   In every aspect of our life, in every part of our life, we are taught that you ought
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.080]   to work hard and earn it.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.760]   Yet when it comes to Christianity, they say, "No, it's just by faith.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.080]   It's not what you do."
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.080]   In fact, if you really sit down and think about it, think about it as somebody who's
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.600]   never heard this gospel before.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.160]   It's like God is giving salvation by faith.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.240]   It has nothing to do with what you earn.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.680]   You can't earn your presence into God.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.720]   Let me put it another way.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.420]   Those of you who are working, if you're working, you've been in a company for about 10 years
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.520]   and you've been working really hard, coming in early and working late.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.560]   And all of a sudden, this guy comes in, you know, and he gets hired and he's slacking
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.560]   off.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.200]   He's not even come to work on time, but yet he's the one who gets to race.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   How would you feel?
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.160]   You know, would you feel that that's fair?
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.560]   It's like, "Well, I mean, he, you know, he can do whatever he wants."
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.920]   How many of you would sit there and think, "This is unjust."
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.920]   Right?
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   "This is unjust.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:21.120]   I put on all that work and yet that's the guy that he gets to race?
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.360]   He gets to create advancement?"
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.680]   When it comes to our spirituality, when it comes to our salvation, sometimes we just
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.360]   kind of accept the grace of God without really thinking about how that would sound like to
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.840]   somebody else.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   Right?
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.640]   That there's people in our lives who are, you know, very moral people.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.480]   And just because they didn't believe in Jesus, that they're not going to go to heaven?
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.800]   Does that sound fair to you?
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.320]   Have you ever spoken to somebody who is trying to share the gospel with somebody who's not
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.960]   a Christian and they say, "Wait a second, you know, I know a bunch of Christians who
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.840]   don't work hard and they're not, you know, it's in my opinion, they're not great people,
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.640]   yet they're going to go to heaven because they say they believe?"
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.600]   And then here's these people who's sacrificing, giving to the poor, and they're adopting children
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.640]   with special needs and they say they can't go to heaven because they don't believe, they
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.980]   don't have faith?
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.200]   How does that sound fair to you?
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   Right?
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.360]   I mean, in life, you know, some of us are doing well, some of us are not doing well,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.920]   but in the end, just to say, "Yeah, I know, I have belief, though.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.840]   My eternity is taken care of."
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.680]   See, if we don't have a proper understanding of what the gospel is, even just embracing
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:44.280]   the gospel without really thinking, we don't really realize how it sounds, and if you aren't
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.440]   in the habit of sharing your faith, you don't know where the holes are, you know, holes
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.240]   in your logic.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.760]   Because we just say, "Oh, he loves me so much, he died for me, and it's by grace of God."
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.760]   That's awesome.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.200]   But then until you sit down and somebody challenges you, like, how does that sound fair?
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   Right?
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.600]   And even the gospel presentation itself, Jesus loves you and died for you, right?
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.360]   Well, first of all, why would he love me?
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.040]   I don't know, right?
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.240]   Why would the God who created the universe, everything is made by him and for him, love
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.240]   me?
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.240]   Why would he love me?
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.240]   Right?
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.480]   But even if you get past that, say, "God loves me, okay?
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.920]   All right, let's now take your word for it, if he loves me, then why would he die for
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.920]   me?"
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   Right?
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.560]   Think about it carefully.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.920]   If you're not a Christian and somebody said, somebody loves you and then died for you,
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.920]   what does that mean?
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.160]   Okay, if you love me, you know, take me out to lunch.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.960]   If you love me, buy me something, or give me some clothes, or give me a lift to the
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:57.640]   airport or something, if you love me, but he loved you so much he died for you.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.840]   What does that mean?
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.720]   We have to be able to answer that fundamental question, or else you don't know what the
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.880]   gospel is.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.240]   You don't know what it is, and because we have such a superficial understanding of our
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.320]   salvation, our response to what the scripture says is going to be just as superficial.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.960]   It's like, "Oh, he died for me, you know, now I'm going to go to heaven, and I'm going
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.800]   to go to church and enjoy this in-between time with my friends."
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.040]   But what does it mean?
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.040]   Right?
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.520]   See, Paul is going to take the next three chapters, chapter 1, verse 18, all the way
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:40.320]   to chapter 3, verse 20, expositing why salvation can only be by faith.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.920]   Why your works is not going to get you into heaven.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:49.520]   And until we are convinced of this, the gospel is not good news.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.840]   It's going to sound like, "He just came and just threw out money."
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.520]   God has just all this money left, and just like, "Here it is, and then whoever happened
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.720]   to grab it are the ones that are going to be saved."
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.680]   That is not how the gospel is presented to us.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.240]   In fact, if you look at verse 18, if you have the NIV, you don't have that word "for."
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.000]   It just jumps straight into, "The wrath of God is being revealed."
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.720]   If you have the NASV or the ESV, the other translation, it will have the word "for"
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   in front of it.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.760]   And that word "for" is actually an important word.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.360]   The word "for" connects this verse and what he's about to say in the next three chapters
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.280]   with the previous, what he said.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.840]   So basically what he's saying is, the key statement in the previous verses is, "The
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.760]   righteous, the just, shall live by faith for the wrath of God is being revealed."
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.880]   Meaning, here's the reason why the just shall live by faith.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.080]   Here are the reasons that I'm going to give you in the next two to three chapters of why
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.760]   salvation is by faith and not by works.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.400]   So the first thing that he comes and tells us is that salvation is by faith first and
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.640]   foremost because the wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.960]   unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.520]   Now obviously that statement is only one of many statements that he's going to make, but
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:19.680]   he's going to introduce for us why Jesus had to die on the cross.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.760]   And why salvation is only by faith and by faith alone.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:32.480]   Now if I, again, yelled in this room, you know, that I have good news, right, and I
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:38.800]   mentioned this before, if I said, you know, "You guys are all healed!"
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.280]   Nobody even clapped, nobody, right?
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.360]   Nobody even smiled, nobody even cracked a smile.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.920]   "You're all healed!"
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.320]   Nothing?
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:55.520]   I just told you some great news, you're all healed!
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:01.440]   See, it's not good news unless you understand what you're healed from, right?
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.440]   If I just say, "You're healed!" and you don't really understand the sickness that you're
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.440]   healed from.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.040]   Now those of you, if I say, "You're healed from this," or "You guys were wrestling with
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.800]   certain kind of ailment," and say, "You're healed from that," then you recognize, "Oh,
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   thank God!"
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   But if I just say, "You're healed!"
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:21.400]   "Okay, I'd rather be healed than sick, though, okay, that's good," right?
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.240]   So the Gospel message begins by identifying the sickness, right?
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.720]   Because without identifying the sickness, it's just news.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.720]   It's just information.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.080]   It's good news, but it's just information.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:40.400]   Here's a reason why, if you read the Old Testament, if you've ever read the Old Testament consecutively
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:47.120]   from Genesis to Malachi, it is dark and depressing, right?
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.400]   You don't do quiet time through the Kings if you're having a bad day.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.040]   You know, "I want something to remind me of the grace of God," you know, "I want somebody
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.360]   to lift me up because, you know, I'm just discouraged."
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.400]   You don't read Kings, right?
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.900]   You might go through Philippians, maybe some parts of Psalms, some parts of Psalms, right?
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.180]   Not all of it.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:11.280]   But if you read consecutively the history of Israel, it is dark.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.800]   And not only is it dark, it gets darker and darker and darker until you get to the book
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.040]   of Malachi, where it is absolutely helpless.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.320]   It is a history of, over and over again, mankind sinning.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:28.320]   You know how mankind sins, God is angry, and He wipes the earth of people, and He saves
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.480]   only eight of them?
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.480]   Now, you would think that God's wrath would end there, but it's only the beginning.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.800]   And the history of Israel is a constantly falling away from the law, and God being angry,
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.720]   judging them, and when God judges them, they come and cry out to God, "God has mercy."
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.000]   And because God has mercy, the nation of Israel is restored.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.520]   And as soon as they're restored, they go right back and they forget God.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.840]   And when they forget God, they turn to idols.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.940]   When they turn to idols, God becomes angry and judges them, and this is a constant cycle.
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.000]   And you would think that at some point, maybe the third cycle or fourth cycle, you know,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.600]   Israel would be, "You know what, we've seen this history before, right?
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.280]   Let's not repeat this."
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.760]   And then they would say, "You know what, from this day forward, we're not going to repeat
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.640]   what our ancestors did."
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.680]   Instead, it gets worse.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.480]   It gets much worse.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.680]   They go over and over again, until we get to the book of Malachi.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:28.320]   If you read through the Old Testament carefully, you're going to, by the time you get to Malachi,
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.200]   you're going to be asking the same question that I ask.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.520]   Why do these people still exist?
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   That's what you're going to ask.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.920]   Instead of asking, I used to think the same thing.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.760]   It's like, "Man, God is, God is, you know, an angry God in the Old Testament."
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.680]   Instead, when you start reading through, it's like, "Why is He so patient with these people?
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.680]   Why doesn't He start over?
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.680]   He did it before.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.680]   Why doesn't He start over?"
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.120]   Right?
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:57.840]   But all through the Old Testament, we have revelation of God's wrath and God's anger.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:03.960]   In fact, if you read the Old Testament carefully, you're going to see that it was intentional.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:09.400]   It was intentional that God and His wrath and His holiness and His justice was revealed
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   so clearly.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.980]   It wasn't just something that they just kind of passed over.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.360]   That was at the core of His character.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.600]   Deuteronomy 4, 23-24, it says, "Take care, lest you forget the covenant of the Lord your
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.240]   God, which He had made with you, and make a carved image, the form of anything that
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.660]   the Lord your God has forbidden you.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:33.340]   For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:38.240]   He told the nation of Israel, 'If you go into this promised land and you forget Me,
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.140]   and you begin to worship idols, now watch out.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:47.360]   Every curse that I said that was going to come upon you is going to come upon you, because
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.760]   He is a consuming fire.'"
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.760]   A consuming fire is something where you can't go into.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.160]   The hotter the flame, the further you have to be away.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.640]   I don't know if you've ever been at a bonfire and then somebody got carried away and poured
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.600]   all the firewood in there all at once.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.360]   It got so hot, everybody had to move back.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.760]   That's the kind of picture that we see of who God is, that God is such a consuming fire,
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.440]   so we can't even be near it.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:17.840]   In fact, Isaiah 53, 34, 14, it says, "Who among us can dwell within the consuming fire?
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.640]   Who among us can dwell with everlasting burning?"
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.080]   And a sinner is even close to who He is.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.360]   He said, "We will be consumed."
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.760]   Now if anybody is sitting here thinking, "Well, thank God we're not in the Old Testament.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.280]   You know, we're in the New Testament.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.040]   You know, He just kind of evolved into this nice, friendly, you know, Santa Claus figure
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.040]   in the New Testament.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.400]   Thank God we don't live in the Old Testament."
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.400]   But in fact, in the book of Hebrews, it describes Him exactly the same way.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.560]   Hebrews chapter 12, 28-29, "Therefore, let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.840]   cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:03.240]   awe, for our God is a consuming fire."
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.720]   This is not just the God of the Old Testament.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.180]   This is the same God of the New Testament.
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:16.200]   If we do not recognize the God that we are worshiping, if we don't know who He is, salvation
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.040]   just like candy being passed out.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.720]   You know, during Halloween, just knock on the right door and you get candy.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.240]   It's a free ticket to go to heaven.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   You know?
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.760]   And so we don't recognize what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.560]   So we're all thankful that we have it.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.960]   Just like if I gave you a dollar bill, you know, you may not be that thankful about it,
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.520]   but still free dollar.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.600]   Right?
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.800]   And that's about the level of appreciation that we have.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.840]   That's about the level of worship that we give.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.720]   Because we don't really appreciate and realize what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.240]   Let me give you an example.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:59.280]   Well, you know, this morning I walked in and I found a lot of black widows in the sanctuary.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.120]   They were all over the place.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.640]   So I was kind of concerned.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:08.160]   I know black widows are dangerous, so I thought maybe I should look it up to see how dangerous
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.160]   it is.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.760]   So maybe we should tell people to not to be here.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.040]   Maybe we should fumigate it before we start in service.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.640]   So I went and I did some research.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.040]   And this is what I found.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.040]   Okay?
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.040]   Are you nervous?
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.040]   Okay.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.720]   So let me read to you what I found.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.760]   This is from the National Geographic website about black widows.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:35.040]   The black widow spider's bite is much feared because its venom is reported to be 15 times
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.040]   stronger than a rattlesnake's.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.040]   Did you know that?
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.040]   I didn't know that.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.040]   You know.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.680]   That's what it says.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.880]   This is on the National Geographic website.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:54.240]   In humans, bites produce muscle aches, nausea, and paralysis of the diaphragm that can make
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.800]   breathing difficult.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.800]   Okay?
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.720]   However, there's a however.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:05.880]   However, contrary to popular belief, most people who are bitten suffer no serious damage,
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.680]   let alone death.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.320]   But bites can be fatal, usually to small children, the elderly, or the infirm.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.600]   Fortunately, fatalities are fairly rare.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:22.360]   The spiders are non-aggressive and bite only in self-defense, such as when someone accidentally
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.920]   sits on it or stomps on it or something like that.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.920]   Right?
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.240]   So you're safe.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.280]   You're not going to die from it.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.280]   You might.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:40.200]   If anybody here gets nauseous or partial paralysis and you can't breathe, you're not going to
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.200]   die.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.200]   So we're safe.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.560]   We're all right.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:49.360]   Anyway, let's look at the verse.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:54.000]   Just the thought of having something that dangerous in the room makes you nervous.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Now I made that up.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   I didn't see black wood.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.280]   I'm sure there's some somewhere.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.800]   But I didn't see it.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   Okay?
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.840]   So the thought of a black widow might be crawling underneath, even after I told you
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.320]   it's not going to lead to fatality, makes us all nervous.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.080]   And we want to look around and say, "Make sure that we're not near."
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.080]   Did I sit on one?
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.760]   You know, "Oh, I feel paralysis here."
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.280]   And if I told you that it was concentrated in this area, you know, when you come in,
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.320]   you probably would all go over there.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.120]   Remember when we had that beam that was broken?
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.880]   It was just in case that thing breaks down.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.880]   Right?
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.520]   Nobody sit in that area.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.760]   Right?
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.720]   The thought of having something that poisonous, that dangerous, even if it doesn't lead to
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.760]   fatality, would cause us to be cautious, to examine carefully.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.280]   Are we near this thing?
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.280]   Is it underneath my feet?
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.280]   Am I going to touch it?
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.600]   You know, am I safe?
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.760]   And that thought is going to be prevalent in your mind.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:57.060]   But when we think about God, we just assume we're safe.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.080]   We assume it.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.880]   We assume we're coming, we approach Him like we're approaching grandpa.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.880]   He's happy no matter what we do.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.520]   In fact, the scripture makes that very clear.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:13.960]   In fact, this week I was listening to a pastor, and his thesis, his main topic of sermon was,
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.960]   God loves you no matter what, so what you do doesn't matter.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.960]   That was his whole message.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.560]   So I was listening to it carefully.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.800]   Did I hear something wrong?
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.880]   And I listened to his sermon.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.840]   Sure enough, that was his message.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.840]   So anybody tells you, puts a guilt trip on you, what you're doing, they're not teaching
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.600]   you about who God is.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.680]   So what we do doesn't matter at all.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:42.420]   See, that's the kind of preaching that has made the church what it is today.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.000]   We don't have a right view of who God is.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.400]   And so therefore, it's just nonchalant, just kind of like, hey, let's go.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.880]   We just assume that if we meet this God, that God is going to embrace us, and He's going
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.680]   to be happy.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.680]   We just assume that.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.760]   We never think, what if He's like the black, you know, the black widow?
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.120]   Now there's nothing that says black widow, if He sees you, He's not going to bite you.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.240]   He says no, He's only going to bite you if you sit on it, if it's aggravated.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:13.920]   So as long as you don't aggravate it, He says it's okay.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.320]   But it still makes you nervous.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.360]   Because that bite can cause paralysis.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.360]   Because it's going to make you feel uncomfortable.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.360]   It could cause you to be very seriously sick.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.280]   And as a result of that, you're very careful.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.680]   You want to examine, make sure you're not near it, you're not going to be bitten, no
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   matter what.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:40.720]   But why do we think, when we think about this Holy God, that we automatically, I'm okay.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.360]   Automatically.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:50.480]   It's because the punch of the Gospel has been taken away.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:59.720]   The need for the cross has been muddled and dummied down and shaved off.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:05.440]   So we don't recognize why we need the cross in the first place.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.800]   It was just passed out like Halloween candy.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.920]   Here it is, anybody want it?
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.440]   Here it is, give Jesus a try.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.560]   Give Jesus a try.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:20.440]   So people stood in line and took it, not recognizing why the Son of God.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.560]   God Himself had to be crucified on the cross.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:33.080]   And the only way that we can be safe from His wrath, from His wrath, from His justice,
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:40.360]   from His anger, is to be clothed in the blood of Christ.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.820]   And because we have not recognized it, and we just kind of glossed over it, our response
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.480]   is just as superficial.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:52.920]   You know, I remember when I first came to the United States and got candy, it was so
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.920]   precious.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:23:01.360]   You know, because back in Korea, back in the early 70s, you just didn't have candy like
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.360]   that.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.360]   It was a big, big deal.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.760]   I came to the United States and my cousin told us that if you put a makeup on, you go
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.760]   trick or treating, they give you candy.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.000]   We're like, "What?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   This is heaven."
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.480]   So, me, my older brother was too embarrassed, so he didn't do it.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.640]   Me and Philip decided we're going to put a, we literally put a paper bag over our head.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.200]   And even that, we only had one bag.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.080]   So I go and knock, and then they give me some candy, and then he, it was his turn, and he
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.000]   would go and knock, and he'd get some candy.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   You know.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.240]   I'm not, I'm not kidding.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.240]   That's exactly what we did.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.080]   We came home with bags of candy.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.160]   You know, we came home, it was probably about two bags, about that size.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.160]   I remember thinking, I was like, "Wow, America is great.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.600]   This is awesome."
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.600]   Right?
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:58.400]   So, I get, I get so dumbfounded today, when now, with our, with kids, our kids or the
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.920]   kids, they say, "Oh, give me some candy."
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.920]   Like, "Nah."
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.920]   "What?
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.920]   It's candy."
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.920]   Right?
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   It's like, "Ah, whatever."
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.800]   You know, because they get it so freely.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.400]   It's so readily available.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.160]   With bags all the time.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.280]   You know, it's not precious anymore.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.920]   Because it's passed out left and right, because we have it everywhere.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.400]   We have it in the pocket, we have it in the car, we have it at school, we have it at home.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.400]   So it's not big of a deal.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.680]   So if you don't get candy today, you might get it tonight.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.200]   You don't get it tonight, you probably get it tomorrow.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.560]   And it's not precious.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:37.820]   And as a result of that, there is no, you know, the candy doesn't have its power.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:43.200]   The candy has lost its power.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:50.520]   When I went to Kenya, you know, with the orphanage that we were visiting for Beloved, you know,
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.240]   those kids, obviously, they don't have anything.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:25:00.320]   So I brought a bag of candy, and literally, they were staring at me like I had something
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.920]   very, very precious.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.120]   And I remember I gave that to them, and they followed me around for a week.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:11.320]   Because every time I reached into my pocket, they thought maybe candy's going to come out.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.200]   And I was just thinking, there's power there.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   There's no power.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.640]   Candy has no power here, but there's power there.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.640]   Right?
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:24.600]   When we don't recognize the preciousness of what it is, what we have been saved from,
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.560]   Gospel is just news.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.440]   It's just news.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.280]   And because it's news, there's no preciousness.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.280]   There's no worship.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.520]   There's no longing.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.160]   There's no praising.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.760]   It's just all theory.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.280]   True worship is when we recognize that we have something great, and we come to worship
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.280]   it.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.480]   Just like a lot of us go to sports stadiums to watch something above us.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.040]   We don't worship something mediocre.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.440]   If Joe and I play basketball today, no one's going to come and pay money to see us play
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.440]   basketball.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.280]   He just happens to be closest to me.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.280]   Right?
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.160]   Because there's nothing to watch.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.320]   We pay money to watch people who are above us do things that we can't possibly imagine
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.320]   doing.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.320]   Right?
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:17.720]   So when the Gospel becomes cheap grace, it's just something that we do, something that
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:24.120]   we say, something that we regurgitate, until we recognize its greatness.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:31.400]   He says, "The Gospel, the wrath of God is being revealed."
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.200]   You know how we talked about in the first part in verse 17, it says, "The righteousness
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.400]   of God is being revealed?"
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.600]   And then that same phrase, "But the wrath of God is being revealed."
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.680]   Why is the righteousness of God being revealed important?
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.040]   And then he says, "You need to understand why salvation is by faith.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.920]   Because the wrath of God is being revealed."
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.960]   It doesn't talk about past tense, it doesn't talk about future tense, it's talking about
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.960]   now.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.960]   Right?
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.920]   So we may ask ourselves, "Well, I know wrath of God is being revealed in maybe in the Middle
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:07.720]   East, maybe in North Korea, maybe in certain horrific events, but you know, living in Orange
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:13.680]   County, California, you know, I feel like grace of God is being revealed every day."
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:19.760]   Wake up every morning, see the sunshine, you know, especially get on the freeway and there's
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.680]   no traffic, the grace of God is being revealed.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.680]   Air conditioner is working.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:31.760]   They have a sale, you get half off for going to Chipotle, grace of God is being revealed.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.760]   Right?
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.960]   We live in Orange County and it's like wrath of God is being revealed.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:41.200]   When's the last time you saw something, you know, and we think like 9/11, we think of
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.640]   some disastrous things, but he says present tense.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.680]   Is Paul talking about only at that time or is this a consistent thing?
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:55.480]   Well, if you look at the tense in Greek, it is referring to an ongoing.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.840]   Something that was there and something that's continuous, it's part of life.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:06.520]   And if we don't recognize the wrath of God being revealed, then the grace of God being
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.160]   revealed would also be nullified.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.400]   Because we don't know what the grace of God is for.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.120]   First of all, the wrath of God is being revealed today in the universal human experience of
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.120]   death.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.920]   Because that's the first thing that the scripture talks about, that he said, "If you eat of
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.200]   this tree, you shall surely die."
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.040]   So as soon as they ate of it, death came.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.520]   In fact, not only did death come in, in Romans 5, 17 it says, "Because of one man's trespass,
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.960]   death reigned through that one man."
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.960]   It reigned.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:42.160]   You know, it didn't just come in and affect some people, it said it reigned, meaning when
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.760]   something reigns, right?
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.860]   It means it has absolute sovereignty, absolute control over.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.840]   And that's how death is described in Romans chapter 5.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.840]   It didn't just affect us that one day we're going to die, it said this death, this separation
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:03.480]   from God had reigned, meaning it affected everything that we do.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:11.000]   See, death is the most tangible evidence of the fallenness of man, it's God's judgment
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   upon mankind.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.920]   He said that's what's going to happen, that's what happens.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.920]   100%.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.920]   100%.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:21.560]   Death was not intended in the Garden of Eden.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.920]   Death came in as a result of rebellion against God.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.560]   And this is the tangible evidence of his judgment.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.720]   So today, you know, we just kind of think about death as like, "Ah, that's just a natural
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.720]   part of life."
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.720]   Just natural.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.840]   So because that's the only way the world can explain it.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.840]   It just happens.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.560]   You live and then you die, right?
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:47.480]   And you just try to milk as much as you can while you're in between.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.560]   But what happens afterwards?
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.500]   How does all of this affect what happens afterwards?
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:58.000]   If you look about, look at our life in the context of just even human history, we're
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   a blip.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:08.440]   We're literally a blip, we're like a mist that comes and then boom, it disappears.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.040]   But see, death was not intended.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.960]   Death was the most tangible evidence of judgment of God.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.240]   You look at Jesus again at the, in front of the tomb of Lazarus where he deliberately
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.520]   waits until he dies to go.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.120]   And everybody is weeping because Lazarus is dead.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.520]   He deliberately goes there late and he's about to raise Lazarus from the dead and we find
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.980]   him weeping.
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.200]   Why would he weep when he's going to raise him from the dead?
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.600]   Why would he weep when he deliberately went there, allowed him to die to raise him from
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.600]   the dead?
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:43.120]   Now, we studied that before when we were studying that passage, but you know, the word for weep
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:48.360]   there that Jesus is described doing is different than the word that the crowds were weeping.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.920]   It was two different words.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.360]   I believe that John was expressing to us that his weeping was different.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.360]   His cause of weeping was different.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.600]   And I believe the reason why he was weeping is because the most tangible evidence of God's
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.680]   judgment upon mankind is death.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.360]   And death reigns.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:12.480]   The only other time we see Jesus crying is when he's going into Jerusalem riding on a
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   donkey.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.240]   Everybody's celebrating, but Jesus is weeping.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.240]   This is only if you knew this day what would bring you peace and because you missed the
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:25.200]   coming of the Messiah, judgment is coming upon Israel.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:32.000]   So in both times, Jesus weeps because of the tangible evidence of the judgment upon mankind.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.920]   Death is a constant reminder to us.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:45.560]   In as it is appointed for all men to die once, after this comes judgment.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:50.840]   Death is a constant reminder to us that judgment, the wrath of God is being revealed.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:56.480]   Secondly, wrath of God is revealed in futility of life.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.480]   Futility of life.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.520]   If you look at the description of God's judgment upon mankind, you read Genesis chapter 317.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.080]   This is how it's described.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.000]   And to Adam he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.480]   the tree of which I commanded you, you shall not eat of it.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.840]   Cursed is the ground because of you."
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.640]   Not only are you cursed, he said life itself, ground itself is going to be cursed.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.560]   In pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.280]   He said not just one part, when you eat, you eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner from the
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.600]   moment you are born until you die.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.320]   So when he says from pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life, he's talking
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:44.120]   about from the moment you are born until the day you die, there's going to be suffering.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.720]   He says in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life, thorns and thistles it
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.280]   shall bring forth for you.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:57.340]   After long days of work, years of working, you may get fire.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.600]   You still may not have enough to eat.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.120]   After hard work you come back home and your husband is mad.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.480]   Your wife is not satisfied with what you've done.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.080]   There's turmoil in the home.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.480]   There's turmoil at work.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.760]   Turmoil everywhere you turn.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.280]   He says verse 19, by the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.680]   ground for out of it you were taken for you are dust and to dust you shall return.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:30.240]   And at the end of your life it's just going to be it.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.200]   You know when we're younger we have this hope and the hope keeps us going, right.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.020]   And the hope is always the next stage.
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.480]   And so up to college life, you know you're thinking like, I'm going to graduate, you
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.480]   know.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.480]   I'm going to be so awesome.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.080]   I see all these band people traveling and have money.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.760]   I can't do that because I don't have money.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:47.760]   Right.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:52.280]   But when I get the job, when I get the job, I'm going to just have freedom.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.280]   Right.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.960]   And then, you know, we do it all the time.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.200]   It's like, you know, I need a job.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.080]   And we pray for that person to get a job.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.720]   They get a job, post it on Facebook.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.360]   And we're like, congratulations.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.360]   God is so awesome.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.680]   He's so gracious.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.440]   And a year later it's like, oh my gosh, I've got to go to work again.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.960]   Why are you doing this to me, God?
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.960]   Right.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.320]   A year before you're praising him for the job.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:19.160]   And then for the rest of your life, you're going to be like, this is it?
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:22.520]   Really, this is it?
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.520]   And you feel the futility.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:28.040]   Some of you guys are like still in the early stages of that.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:33.520]   And you're thinking in your head, maybe if I change my job, it'll get better.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.360]   There's some people in here who've changed their job about four or five times.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.240]   Ask them.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.560]   Ask them if the job changes their life.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.440]   You know, it changes for a little bit because it's new.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.480]   Just like when you buy a new car, but after two, three years, it's no longer new.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.800]   And you repeat that same cycle.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.760]   And after that cycle, what does it say?
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.240]   From the dust you came to dust you'll go.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.440]   And then you go through the cycle.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.440]   And then what is this?
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.220]   Is this it?
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.220]   And then you die.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:10.000]   That's modern interpretation of Genesis 317, right?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   You go and go and go.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.860]   The futility of life.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.280]   He says, yes, that's how it's going to be.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.280]   Because of the judgment.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:24.400]   The wrath of God is being revealed in death, in corruption, in futility.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.720]   And when we recognize all of this, and we just think, oh, if I just tweak it here, and
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.500]   if I got a different job, or went through a different career, or found a different person,
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.980]   and we keep tweaking this, thinking that somehow if we keep tweaking it, we're going to just
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:39.340]   get it right, and then everything's going to be okay.
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.940]   Everybody in life does that.
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.940]   And then they die that way.
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:45.940]   Everybody does that.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:46.940]   And then they die that way.
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:51.220]   And even in their 70s and 80s and 90s, they're still tweaking.
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.220]   Maybe if I just get there.
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.840]   Maybe if I lived here.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.500]   Maybe if my kids did this.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.700]   And they're all just tweaking just a little bit, thinking that if I can just get this
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:06.220]   right, and then at some point you have to recognize that that's nothing new under the
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.140]   sun.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.020]   Generations before us went through that.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.280]   Generation now is going to go through that.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.780]   After us is going to go through that.
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:17.500]   He says because that's the result of sin.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.820]   That's the judgment of God on mankind.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.340]   The third and finally is the final judgment.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:30.700]   The wrath of God is being revealed in human degradation.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.420]   Three separate times, and I'm not going to get into it this morning, but three separate
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:39.060]   times it says God gave them over.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.460]   Romans 124, God gave them over.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.500]   126, for this reason God gave them over.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.580]   128, for this reason God gave them over.
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:52.860]   In other words, you keep chasing after that, I'll let you go.
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.580]   I'll let you go.
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.340]   And no longer God is speaking.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.340]   No longer God is chasing.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:04.820]   Again, we're going to get into that when we get to this text.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:11.300]   But the final judgment of God, where God releases you, you want to be independent of me?
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.300]   Do it.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.300]   Okay?
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.700]   I'm not going to play tug of war with you anymore.
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.700]   And he gives them over.
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.740]   And that's what the scripture says.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.740]   And we think somehow that freedom, oh we have freedom, now I don't have to do this and that.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.580]   And somehow that's what freedom is.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:32.700]   The worst thing that I can do for my kids is kick them out of the house.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:33.700]   You want the freedom?
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.700]   Go.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.700]   Go.
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.700]   Do whatever.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.460]   Now you can do whatever you want.
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.140]   Wake up whenever you want.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.780]   Eat whatever you want.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:42.780]   Sleep whenever you want.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.540]   Do whatever you want.
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.260]   That is the final judgment.
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.180]   It's to let them be.
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:55.460]   Now as parents we know exactly what that's going to lead to.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:02.820]   But the scripture says when God brings judgment upon mankind, he allows mankind to go the
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.100]   direction that they are fighting to go.
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.580]   And he says go.
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:11.420]   And then human degradation, you see how far that goes.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:14.060]   Do you notice that in our culture?
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.420]   Have you noticed that in our generation?
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.660]   I'm sure you have.
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:24.300]   He said the wrath of God is being revealed against all ungodliness, unrighteousness.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:31.620]   Where the truth of God that God is trying to reveal is being suppressed by their unrighteousness.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:38.100]   And all of this is a revelation of God's judgment upon mankind.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:46.940]   Which you and I were born into, that every sinner is in, and every person who has not
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:52.980]   been covered by the blood of Christ will meet this holy, holy, holy consuming fire of a
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.980]   God.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.340]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.860]   When we think about our walk with God.
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:04.300]   Have we just glossed over our sin?
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.220]   We just assume God's going to forgive.
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.220]   Of course he always forgives.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.060]   He's a gracious and loving God.
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.060]   Why wouldn't he forgive?
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.900]   And every time I go to a grandma, she gives me candy.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.100]   Why wouldn't God give me candy?
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:21.180]   You may not be thinking in those terms, but our attitude toward God is not much deeper
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.060]   than that.
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.700]   Why wouldn't he?
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:34.140]   In Jeremiah 3, 9 through 10, God sends Jeremiah to an obstinate, stiff-necked people.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:37.940]   People who are sinning after God, chasing after idols, one generation after generation.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.460]   But they were very busy at the temple.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.140]   They didn't burn down the temple.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.900]   They were very busy doing religious things.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.540]   But they were doing it because they think if they appease God, that somehow God is going
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.180]   to bless them, they're going to become rich.
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.620]   But yet they were compromised.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.180]   And this is what God says to them.
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.160]   Jeremiah 3, 9.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:02.220]   Because she, meaning the nation of Israel, took her whoredom lightly.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:06.980]   She polluted the land committing adultery with stone and tree.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:13.140]   Meaning when God brought Jeremiah to expose their sin, they said, "What sin?"
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:18.980]   And they considered their sin light.
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.500]   Do we consider our sin light?
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.140]   We don't take it seriously.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.780]   Of course, God's a loving God.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:29.580]   You know, how many times do we say, you know, well, this, everybody, this is how everybody
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:30.580]   is.
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:36.740]   Well, how many times do we cover over sin by excusing it by saying, "Where do you draw
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:37.980]   the line down?
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.700]   Did God call everybody to do this?"
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:48.520]   How often do we just kind of cover over and justify our sins and not take it seriously
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.940]   as God takes it?
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:59.340]   And then not only does He indict the individuals, He indicts most severely the leaders.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:03.420]   And in the indictment against the leadership, this is what He says, "They have healed the
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.220]   wounds of My people lightly."
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:09.620]   And you say, "Oh, okay, that's why.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:13.860]   The leaders didn't really care and they weren't gentle enough with the people and really cared
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.340]   and counseled them."
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.260]   You know, that's what we can take out of that first.
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.500]   But here's how they took it lightly.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.820]   Here's how the nation of Israel or their leaders were being rebuked and they're going to be
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:24.820]   judged first.
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:30.180]   And He says, "They have healed the wounds of My people lightly saying, 'Peace, peace,'
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.060]   when there is no peace."
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:35.820]   They didn't expose their sin.
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:39.860]   They didn't confront them with God's judgment.
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.780]   And they kept on telling Him, "Peace, peace."
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:47.380]   And as a result of that, everybody thought, "Well, if the leaders, the priests, you know,
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.960]   these prophets, they're telling us that God is fine.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.020]   Why are you, Jeremiah?
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:56.180]   Why are you constantly a downer?"
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:00.340]   And at the end, judgment comes upon them.
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.820]   And the whole time, until the judgment comes, they say, "Why?
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:07.620]   Why would God be angry with us?
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:11.340]   Why would He be angry with us?"
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:16.140]   There is only one way a sin can be justified.
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.680]   You know, we could justify with dumbing down our theology.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:24.820]   We can lower the bar by changing, you know, our theology so that we don't feel guilty.
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.740]   It's like, "Oh, guilt is legalism."
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.740]   You could say all of that.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:34.260]   And all of that, the end result of it is just, sin is not that bad.
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:39.860]   But real justification can only come by the blood of Christ.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:46.400]   When we recognize our sin in light of who He is, and we see the wrath of God being revealed,
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:51.300]   and we come before God in desperation and repent.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.580]   Repentance.
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:56.260]   Before there is forgiveness, there is repentance.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:00.020]   You can't jump from sin to forgiveness.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:06.240]   Sin causes us to recognize that the wrath of God is being revealed because of that,
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:12.180]   and then we are convicted, we repent, and then so therefore, God forgives.
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.880]   It has to be in that order.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:22.740]   In Genesis chapter 3, when God confronted Adam, He said, "Who told you?
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:23.740]   Who told you you were naked?
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:24.740]   Why?
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:25.740]   Did you eat of the tree?"
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.800]   He said, "It's the woman, the woman you put here.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.640]   She gave it to me and I ate."
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:38.440]   Think about how often we justify our sins because we do what we do because of them.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.840]   "Oh, my wife, you know, she does this.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.040]   I mean, it's impossible to be a good Christian in this home.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:49.920]   Oh, my husband, you know what I mean, he doesn't appreciate anything I do, and so therefore,
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.540]   I can only be this way.
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:53.040]   You don't know my background.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.220]   You don't know how I grew up.
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:55.400]   You don't know what happened to me.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.400]   I am the way I am.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:01.280]   The reason why I'm bitter and angry is because I've been wronged.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:05.500]   It's the woman that you put in here is causing me, is forcing me.
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:10.360]   Put anybody else in my situation and they would sin too."
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.440]   And how often we justify our sins in blaming everybody else.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:19.240]   "I am the way I am because the people that you put in my life is making me do this."
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:24.000]   In other words, "It's not my fault."
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.920]   In other words, "It's your fault."
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.920]   Go see Eve.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.280]   Who told you you were naked?
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.860]   The serpent.
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:35.800]   The serpent did it.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.000]   He's the one.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.840]   How often do we justify our sins?
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:54.360]   That our bitterness, our anger, our spiritual dryness, all of that is because of our surrounding.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.280]   Because of our people.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.680]   Because of our circumstance.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:03.760]   So the moment we begin to justify our sins, there is no repentance.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:10.320]   The first step to come to God is to recognize that I'm a sinner.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.280]   That I am deserving of this wrath.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.280]   It's me.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.160]   It's me, O Lord, standing in the need of prayer.
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.160]   It's me.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.520]   It's me, O Lord.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:26.120]   Not my brother, not my sister, but me, O Lord, standing in the need of prayer.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.640]   There can be no repentance.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:35.520]   If we're constantly justifying our sins, the wrath of God is being revealed against
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:41.360]   all ungodliness, all unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.360]   truth.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.400]   Would you close your eyes with me for a minute?
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:50.400]   Again, I invite you to take some time to pray.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.520]   I'm absolutely convinced.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:57.560]   I know that some of the problems that you are in, you know, say, "Hey, you know, you're
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:02.040]   making, you're kind of, you know, belittling it, thinking like, "Oh, there's a simple answer."
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:07.000]   And I understand life is complicated, and some of us are in very complicated situations,
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.800]   whether it's work or family or whatever it may be.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:16.000]   But God has given one path to life.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.760]   He says, "Come to me, all who are weary and have related."
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.280]   Jesus is the only one who can unburden this life.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.320]   And if we're constantly thinking that if we have the right people in our lives and right
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.920]   circumstances, somehow things are going to get right, He says, "No, we're missing the
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.920]   whole point."
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.920]   Right?
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:36.560]   The only path to life is Christ, and the only way to Christ is by repentance through the
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.400]   blood of Christ.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:46.200]   So I invite you this morning to own up to our sins, to own up to my part.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   I've sinned.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:52.800]   It's because of corruption in my heart that I am who I am.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.200]   And Lord, I believe, help my unbelief.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:01.800]   So I want to invite you this morning to come before God in repentance and in prayer.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:06.080]   Thank you, Lord, for giving me a way of salvation by the blood of Christ.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:12.000]   That if I've taken His grace as just cheap candy, that I didn't really see the preciousness
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.120]   of what it is that we have in Christ, that you would come before the Lord and ask, "Lord,
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:21.440]   open my eyes to see that I may give worship and follow you with my whole heart."
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.680]   So let's take some time to pray.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.520]   Alright.
