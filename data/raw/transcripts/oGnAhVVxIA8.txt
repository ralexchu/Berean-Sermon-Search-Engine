[00:13:48.500 --> 00:14:08.300]   - Good morning.
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.800]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.080]   Those of you who are here physically
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.400]   and those of you who are online joining our service.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.120]   We have a few announcements before we get started.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.560]   First of all, our college ministry is going on campus
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.360]   on November 12th for evangelism.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.840]   It's at one, two, and 3 p.m.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.520]   So if you wanna participate in that,
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.360]   please let Pastor Nate know
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.000]   and he'll give you directions on what they're doing.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.680]   Next Sunday, our seeds department is gonna be opening up
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.480]   for the three and four year olds.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.080]   So we're trying to prep for that.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.240]   And because of that, we're asking the parents,
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.360]   we're asking the rest of the church
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.560]   to reserve the parking across the street for the parents.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.280]   And so if you have small children
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.320]   and you need that parking space, you can do that.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.920]   Otherwise, we're asking the others
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.920]   to either park down the street or in the corner behind
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.440]   and we'll have parking signs to kind of direct you
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.800]   so that we can reserve just for the second service.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.520]   So if you're the first service, it's okay,
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.520]   but second service in order to save that space.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.960]   So if you have small children,
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.200]   small children meaning small, okay?
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.920]   So if your kids are 18, that's not small, okay?
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.200]   So that's for the service parking across the street,
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.640]   if you can be reminded of that next week.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.880]   And then college is also having a car rally
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.760]   at 2 p.m. this Saturday.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.840]   You can read that for yourselves.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.680]   And also maintenance day, this coming Saturday,
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.480]   if you are available, we need you to come
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.560]   and just volunteer, come at 8.30 to 11.30.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.220]   We're gonna clean up the church.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.200]   We have a lot of little things that we need to get to.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.880]   So the more, the merrier.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.600]   We're gonna be looking at things inside
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.520]   and outside the church.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.960]   So if you guys can come at 8.30 next Saturdays.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.120]   And please sign up if you are able to come
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.360]   so that we'll know how many of you
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.180]   are gonna be showing up for that.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.160]   Also next Sunday after the second service at 1.30 p.m.,
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.560]   it's just enough time for you to go grab lunch
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.920]   and then come back.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.640]   And there's going to be a special seminar
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.360]   to address the worldview of secular social justice,
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.680]   critical race theory in particular,
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.600]   and what it teaches and why we need to be careful.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.660]   And then we're gonna have the second part of that Q&A
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.340]   to address what does that mean for us as a church?
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.300]   How do we apply this?
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.960]   Or what are some things that we need to be mindful of?
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.820]   And so that's gonna be taking place at 1.30.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.800]   And you do need to sign up because it is not open.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.420]   And there will not be video
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.380]   or we're not gonna be casting it online.
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.020]   So you need to be here physically.
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.340]   So if you're planning to come and you haven't signed up,
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.180]   you absolutely need to do that today.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.420]   And the link is going to be on the website,
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.220]   the website and on the Facebook, okay?
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.580]   All right, outside of that,
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.060]   we're gonna have time for offering.
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:46.940]   So let's pray.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.320]   And again, those will give you a minute
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.940]   to give the offering online or the physical offering box.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.660]   We'll have it in the back of the sanctuary.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.760]   All right, let's pray.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:01.220]   Heavenly Father, we praise you for goodness
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.320]   in the midst of all that is going on around the world.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.400]   We thank you that you are our anchor,
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:15.720]   not politics, not finance, not health, not friendships.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:20.960]   We thank you for all of those things,
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.200]   but we know Father God that ultimately,
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.680]   and especially now, we ask Lord God
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.420]   that you would help us to come to the throne of grace
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:34.920]   with confidence that we may find help in time of need.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.080]   So we ask Lord God that your word, as it is opened,
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.360]   that it may minister to us, guide us, lead us, rebuke us,
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.200]   and build us up for the sake of your name.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.840]   I pray that the offering that we give
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.320]   help us to be intentional,
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.320]   help us, Lord God, to be joyful,
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.400]   and may it be multiplied for your use.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.140]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.160]   (gentle piano music)
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   (children laughing)

[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:47.300]   - Let us all rise as we sing these praises.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.380]   (gentle piano music)
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:19:00.220]   Stand up, love.

[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:23.700]   - You may all be seated.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:32.380]   - All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.580]   to Hebrews chapter 11, verse seven.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.020]   We're gonna be looking at Noah,
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.740]   the third person on this list of heroes of faith.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.900]   Hebrews chapter 11, verse seven.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.860]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.620]   By faith, Noah, being warned by God
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.740]   about things not yet seen, in reverence,
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.620]   prepared an ark for the salvation of his household
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.300]   by which he condemned the world
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.140]   and became an heir of the righteousness
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.740]   which is according to faith.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:04.560]   Let's pray.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.540]   Father, I praise you.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.380]   We need you.
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.820]   Lord, we plead with you.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:23.260]   May your word have its intended effects in our hearts.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.300]   I pray, Lord God, that you would soften hearts
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.620]   that have become callous.
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:33.100]   If we have drifted, call us back that we may be anchored,
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:37.500]   that we may live lives truly worthy of the gospel
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.060]   that we proclaim to believe.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:44.540]   I pray that these truths would not fall on deaf ears.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:48.540]   May your word and your word alone go forth
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.100]   and accomplish its purpose.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.760]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.540]   All right, so when we think about the story of Noah,
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.980]   if you can put up the first, okay.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.220]   I don't know if you guys can see it.
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.700]   That's a typical picture that we remember
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.420]   when we think of Noah, right?
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.220]   You have these cute animals
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.980]   who are sitting on this large boat two by two, right?
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.460]   And so if you grew up in the church,
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.180]   you're very familiar with this picture, you know?
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.860]   But this is not an accurate depiction
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.860]   of what we see in Genesis.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.360]   If you go to the next picture,
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.380]   and that's obviously a rendition of a tsunami
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.380]   that's coming and wiping away a small town.
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:35.380]   The story of Noah is really the devastation of mankind,
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.460]   that God's judgment.
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.740]   It really is a foreshadowing of what God says
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.260]   is gonna happen to mankind.
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.180]   And he preserved only eight people.
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:50.460]   1,500 years have passed since Adam.
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.220]   And during those 1,500 years,
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.400]   all those hundreds of thousands of people
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.540]   that must have been born during that period,
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.660]   and only eight people survived this judgment.
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.700]   So the story of Noah is a depiction
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.140]   of the judgment that is coming.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.420]   It serves as a warning to mankind
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.220]   to take God's word seriously.
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:15.780]   And it also is a picture of how God will save mankind.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.380]   So I think we need to be careful
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.500]   when we teach our children that we don't simply sanitize
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.900]   what this story really is about.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.420]   Because when I was younger,
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.640]   and I'm not saying that we can't ever use those pictures,
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.080]   but when I was younger, before I became a Christian,
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.320]   when I thought of Noah, I've had that in my mind.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.100]   It's a cute picture of animals coming together
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.020]   and riding a boat, going to the zoo.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:45.660]   And I remember once reading what the story was about.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:49.420]   It's like, wow, this is the story of the judgment of God.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:53.140]   And we would never picture
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.980]   the book of Revelation in that way.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.360]   In fact, if you look at it,
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.860]   the animals coming to the ark
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.820]   is a very small portion of what happens.
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:06.820]   Majority of it is God warning year after year after year.
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:10.540]   And in obedience, God leaves a witness.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:14.060]   And in the end, just as God says, "Devastation comes."
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.580]   If you look at Genesis,
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.340]   Noah is introduced to us in chapter five,
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.380]   just in genealogy.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.620]   And then chapter six, seven, eight, and nine,
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.660]   and then 10 is about Noah's life.
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.520]   So we have about six chapters in the book of Genesis
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.840]   about Noah and his descendants.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.760]   The only other person on this list
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.640]   that gets that kind of attention is Abraham.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.120]   And yet in this text, we only have one verse.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.520]   So it's not that his life isn't significant,
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.500]   but that every part of what he says in verse seven
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.320]   is hugely significant.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.240]   Because God uses Noah repeatedly
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.840]   in the Old Testament and the New Testament
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.000]   as an example of the judgment to come.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:06.080]   We need to take heed as we study Noah's life.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:10.400]   And we need to ask ourselves if Noah,
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.680]   what happened to Noah, serves to remind the world
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.260]   that judgment is coming.
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:23.020]   And then to live the rest of our lives
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.820]   with this sanitized version,
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:28.600]   where we're trying to make a better life,
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.680]   we're trying to have an easier life, a healthier life,
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.240]   a long and prosperous life.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.280]   The whole time professing,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.320]   mankind is gonna be wiped out.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.520]   Maybe not through a flood, as God said
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.440]   that he was not going to do it in that way.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.680]   But if you read the book of Revelation, it's pretty clear.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.880]   The devastation that's coming at the end of human history
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.560]   is going to be much like the flood.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.720]   In fact, greater than the flood.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.960]   Because it's going to be an eternal judgment.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:01.120]   What is it that we are to learn from this text?
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:06.120]   So, I divide it into three things
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.400]   that I think we really need to pay attention to.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.960]   First is, that through Noah,
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.980]   God warns the world to turn from their sins.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:18.960]   And that really is the core of the gospel message.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.400]   It's not simply that there is a superpower being
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.720]   who created the universe, who loves you unconditionally,
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.360]   why don't you give him a try?
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.720]   Open your heart and let him in,
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.080]   and God will take care of your life.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.240]   That is not the gospel message.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.640]   The gospel message begins by saying
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.080]   God is actually angry with this world.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.960]   He is so angry, he was so grieved by what he saw.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.840]   He told Noah that they are all gonna be gone.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.680]   Not just a few select, not just people here and there,
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.880]   he said, all of it.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.440]   In Genesis 6, 12, God looked on the earth
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.480]   and behold, it was corrupt,
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.200]   for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.040]   And God said to Noah,
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.680]   "The end of all flesh has come before me."
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.160]   End of all flesh.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.960]   And when he says all flesh, he meant all flesh.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.720]   All of mankind.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.560]   I mean, look at the whole world has been locked down
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.160]   because we're afraid that we're gonna get this virus
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.720]   and a few of us might die.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:29.000]   0.2% might die if we get this.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.440]   And so in fear, the whole economy has been shut down.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.040]   People can't travel.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.560]   Schools have been shut down.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.280]   But God says to Noah, all flesh.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.240]   All flesh, 100% of the flesh has fallen short.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.000]   For the earth is filled with violence because of them
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   and behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.320]   Now we would love to sanitize this and say,
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.920]   well, you know, God was done with that
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.320]   in the book of Genesis.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.520]   He started, he may have started out with that,
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.600]   but surely that's not who he is now.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.120]   I think you and I know better.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:17.040]   This warning is throughout human history.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.520]   In fact, it escalates because he said the wrath of God
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.960]   is being stored up.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.360]   It's being stored up.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:28.200]   If God was so grieved with 1500 years of men rebelling
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.880]   and sinning against God, how about tens of thousands
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.400]   of years?
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.400]   If he was angry with a few hundred thousand people sinning,
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.680]   how about billions and billions of people
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.560]   rebelling against God?
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.920]   So when he says the anger of God is being stored up
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.200]   and we see a glimpse, a tiny glimpse of that
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.120]   in the book of Revelation,
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.320]   what would the wrath of God look like then?
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.120]   In Amos chapter 3, 7, it says,
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.600]   "Surely the Lord God does nothing unless he reveals
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.320]   his secret counsel to his servant, the prophets."
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:06.640]   God uses Noah, the prophets, the scriptures, the church,
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.720]   the apostles, missionaries, pastors, lay people.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:15.400]   Each one of us has been called what he revealed to us
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.880]   to tell the nations.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:22.080]   He says, "Surely the Lord God does nothing unless he reveals
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.600]   his secret counsel to his servants, the prophets."
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.560]   That's exactly what it says, Hebrews 11, 7,
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.480]   by faith Noah, being warned by God
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.280]   about things not yet seen.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.800]   God warned Noah first.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.080]   Remember last week we talked about how Enoch
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.240]   was established and he was caught up?
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:44.120]   In Jude 14 and 15, he was the first evangelist
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.640]   who warned about the judgment to come.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:51.760]   You know, but what's interesting is Enoch has a child
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.800]   before he is taken up.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.840]   His name is Methuselah.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.360]   And his claim to fame in the Bible is that he lived
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:01.040]   the longest of all human beings recorded in Genesis.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.040]   He lived 969 years.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.520]   But the significance of Methuselah
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.160]   is not the length of his life.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.680]   His name literally means in Hebrew,
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.560]   when he is dead, it shall be sent.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.200]   Now you know that God does nothing by accident.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.800]   That even the names of the prophets,
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.520]   even the names of the patriarchs have significance
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.440]   because God embedded in their name
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.800]   what he planned to do in the future.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.920]   Methuselah's name is, when he dies, it shall be sent.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.400]   If you look at the chart of their life,
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.120]   we know exactly what he was talking about
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.160]   because Enoch dies, Methuselah is born.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.800]   When Methuselah dies, what happens?
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.080]   The flood comes, right?
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.120]   Flood comes.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.400]   So God did not all of a sudden sprung it up on mankind
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.400]   and say, I'm done, and then you guys are finished.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.760]   He's been telling Enoch, he's been telling Noah.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.400]   He prophesied within Methuselah's very life.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.000]   Warning the nations to turn.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.200]   God has implanted all throughout history,
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.200]   every part of scripture,
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.520]   warning about the judgment to come.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.680]   The church has sanitized the gospel
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.000]   because it is not palatable to the world.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.960]   They will not come to church if we emphasize this aspect.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:30.960]   That's why hell slowly has fallen off the pulpit.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.200]   I wanna talk about being encouraging.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.960]   Life is hard enough as it is.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.880]   We have pastors who just outright say,
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.080]   I'm not gonna preach about sin
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.560]   because it ruins people's days.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.560]   So they have not rejected it and said,
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.320]   it's not because I don't believe in sin.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.720]   It's because if we talk too much about it,
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.160]   people are gonna be discouraged
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.640]   and they're not gonna come to church.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.600]   And by all practical purposes,
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.600]   it's been weeded out of the church.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.720]   And yet the central message of the gospel
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.360]   is a warning about the judgment to come.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.640]   There's a reason why Noah's story
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.680]   is six chapters in the book of Genesis.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.240]   He didn't just pick out a few people here and there.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.480]   He was so angered, he wiped out the earth.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:20.240]   Isaiah 13, nine, "Behold, the day of the Lord is coming,
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:25.160]   "cruel with fury and burning anger,
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.600]   "to make the land a desolation,
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.000]   "and he will exterminate the sinners from it."
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   The way that we understand God,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.280]   Isaiah 13, nine, doesn't make any sense.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.400]   Why would a loving God do this?
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.840]   And that's a common question
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.840]   that Christians in this generation,
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.080]   even Christians in the church in this generation,
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.080]   ask that question.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.400]   Why would a loving God do this?
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:53.000]   It's because they've forgotten about Noah.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.560]   Because we made the story about Noah,
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:59.640]   about two animals going home and resting and having fun.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.360]   He actually did it already.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.880]   In 2 Peter 3, 10, "But the day of the Lord will come
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.360]   "like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.160]   "with a roar, and the elements will be destroyed
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.520]   "with intense heat, and the earth and its works
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.160]   "will be burned up."
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.040]   All that you and I treasure.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:26.720]   This means that every beautiful place that we visited,
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.720]   everything that the world says is magnificent.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.120]   He says, "The earth is gonna be burned up.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.640]   "It's all gonna be destroyed."
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.880]   And he warns the church not to be caught off guard,
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.240]   as if a thief is coming.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.960]   In other words, pay attention to his word.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.040]   Remember what he says.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.520]   Revelations 9, 18 and 19, "A third of mankind,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:54.040]   "a third of mankind was killed by these three plagues."
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:00.720]   He's only talking about one event.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.880]   If you've ever read the book of Revelation,
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.840]   70% of what he says is about the judgment that's to come.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.840]   And in one verse he says, "These three plagues
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.920]   "killed a third of mankind by the fire and the smoke
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.380]   "and the brimstone which proceeded out of their mouths.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.320]   "For the power of the horses is in their mouths
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.800]   "and in their tails, for the tails are like serpents
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.640]   "and have heads, and with them they do harm."
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.280]   Today, if you preach from this text,
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.320]   immediately you get the label,
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.560]   "Oh, he's a fire and brimstone preacher."
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.680]   Which means, I'm not gonna go to a church,
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.960]   a fire and brimstone, that's an ancient thing.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.860]   That's what they did 100 years ago.
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.160]   No one's gonna sit through that.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.720]   And they're absolutely correct.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.420]   Because we have a generation of people
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.000]   who think fire and brimstone is not biblical.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.460]   That is not the God that they serve,
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.600]   and they are absolutely correct.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.560]   We have a generation of filled with people
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.240]   just quoting scripture, they get offended.
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:01.040]   And yet, the Bible tells us to not to ignore.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.160]   As much as we love to hang verses and memorize scripture
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.260]   and put it on our T-shirts and tell it to our children
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.620]   about the grace of God, the faithfulness of God,
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.720]   of the mercy of God, the Bible is filled
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.840]   with warnings of Noah.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.640]   That this judgment is real.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.020]   That when the end comes,
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.280]   when the white throne judgment comes,
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.680]   what comes after that, there is no mercy.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.160]   Up to that point, God is being patient.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.560]   He's being faithful.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.680]   He's waiting patiently.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.000]   But after the white throne judgment,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.400]   what happens in the day of Noah is gonna seem merciful.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.720]   And it is not one verse.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.600]   It is not one event.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.640]   All throughout scripture,
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.840]   mankind is warned that this will come.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:51.480]   Romans 118, "For the wrath of God is revealed,"
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.800]   is even now being revealed,
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.240]   "from heaven against all ungodliness
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.320]   "and unrighteousness of men
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.560]   "who suppress the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:06.800]   If you go on and share the gospel to the unbelieving world,
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.400]   one of the most common questions you get is,
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.520]   how can a God that you say is loving
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.360]   allow 9/11 to happen?
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.960]   How can a God who is so loving and gracious
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.600]   and who loves us so much,
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.840]   why does he allow sex trafficking to happen?
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.880]   Why does he allow poverty to happen?
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.720]   Why do they allow injustice to happen
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.160]   if your God is so good?
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.160]   Part of the reason why is because
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.880]   we've preached the wrong gospel.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:36.760]   We've sanitized the gospel
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:37.920]   where they don't understand
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.520]   that God is angry with this world.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.680]   That in our natural state, if we die,
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.880]   we're not gonna meet a gracious and loving God.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.280]   We're gonna meet the God of Noah.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.040]   Where he was so grieved and angered
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.480]   that he said, "Enough!"
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.160]   And he wiped out the earth.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.280]   That's the God that a man and a woman
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.160]   who is not covered by the blood of Christ
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.800]   will meet on the judgment day.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.080]   And the Bible tells us
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.240]   that the wrath of God is being revealed.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.000]   So whenever you see,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.680]   whenever you see disaster happening
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.040]   because of the sinfulness of mankind,
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.440]   it is a glimpse.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:23.440]   It is a glimpse of what will come in the future.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.360]   In fact, the question really is,
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.600]   the only reason why we don't see more of it
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.520]   is because of common grace.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.480]   It's because he left the church as a witness.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:39.000]   It's because he left the church
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.520]   to sanctify and to be the light.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.840]   But one day that light and the darkness
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.640]   is gonna be separated for eternity.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.040]   And the Bible tells us that you and I are here
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:55.040]   just as Noah was given this message to share.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.000]   Hebrews 11, seven, it says,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.080]   "By which he condemned the world."
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.600]   Genesis 6 says, "The Lord was sorry
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.720]   "that he had made man on earth."
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.400]   In the NIV, it says, "He grieved."
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.320]   And that's exactly the meaning behind this,
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.320]   that God was so disturbed by the sins of mankind
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.200]   that he said, "Enough!"
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:23.200]   Imagine if God had enough 1,500 years,
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:27.080]   what his wrath would look like
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.080]   after all these years of being stored up,
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.440]   all these years of violence,
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.120]   all these years of blasphemy,
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.880]   all these years of murder,
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.680]   all these years of sexual immorality
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.240]   that has been stored up.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.920]   In Ephesians 4, 30, it says,
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.680]   "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit,
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.160]   "the Holy Spirit of God."
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.920]   Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.560]   Imagine God was grieved because of sin of mankind
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.960]   and he wiped them out.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.440]   Ephesians 4, 30, when it says,
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.920]   "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God."
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:04.920]   Imagine, imagine not realizing
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.600]   how much God hates sin.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.880]   He hates sin so much
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.200]   that he was willing to start all over.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.880]   When he says, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit,"
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.080]   he's talking about an almighty God
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.080]   who by the snap of his finger
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.720]   can wipe out the earth with a flood,
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.280]   with fire, with plague.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:31.240]   He said, "Do not poke this God.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.280]   "Do not take lightly who he is."
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:35.120]   That's what it means,
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.600]   "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit."
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.800]   It's not saying, "Do not make him sad."
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.680]   It's not saying, "Don't get on the wrong side."
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.680]   To grieve the Holy Spirit is to stir up anger and wrath.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:53.320]   If that's what he says,
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.680]   Genesis 6, 7, "For the Lord said,
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.820]   "I will blot out man whom I have created
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.920]   "from the face of the land.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.600]   "From man to animals, to creeping things,
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.080]   "and all the birds of the sky.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:06.800]   "For I am sorry, I am grieved that I made them."
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.120]   Romans 2, 4-5.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.880]   "Or do you think lightly of the riches
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.840]   "of his kindness and tolerance and patience,
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.560]   "not knowing that the kindness of God
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.960]   "leads you to repentance?"
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:23.200]   Whole reason why we even repent is
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.880]   because God was merciful.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.000]   Wasn't our doing.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.120]   He said, "Do you take lightly the grace of God,
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.160]   "not knowing that God saved us from this wrath?"
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.000]   And then in verse five,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.580]   "But because of your stubbornness
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.040]   "and your unrepentant heart,
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.520]   "you are storing up wrath for yourself
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.760]   "in the day of wrath."
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.200]   After hearing the gospel,
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.120]   after being enlightened,
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.960]   after being around the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.000]   after being in the church,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.160]   given the word of God,
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.560]   and after all of that,
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.480]   you simply drift along into the world,
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.880]   denying the Savior by our life,
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.400]   loving him with our lips.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:08.880]   Do you not know that repentance is God's kindness?
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.320]   If observing mankind stirred him up that much,
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.520]   how much more if we are storing up this wrath for ourselves?
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.960]   Matthew 24, 37, 39,
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.120]   "For the coming of the Son of Man
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.640]   "will be like the days of Noah.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.920]   "For as in those days before the flood,
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.080]   "they were eating and drinking,
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.520]   "marrying and giving in marriage
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.240]   "until the day that Noah entered the ark."
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.040]   You notice here, he doesn't talk about pornography.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.920]   He doesn't talk about murder.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.440]   He doesn't talk about poverty or injustice.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.680]   He just says they were just marrying,
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.920]   giving in marriage, drinking, eating,
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.600]   just like everybody else does in this world.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.880]   Yet in all of that,
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.360]   they were living in rebellion against God
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.920]   'cause they refused to acknowledge God.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:01.000]   "And they did not understand until the flood came
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.320]   "and took them all away.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.000]   "So will the coming of the Son of Man be."
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.360]   So the storing of the wrath
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:13.160]   isn't just murdering and killing,
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.760]   just living a life where God is not honored
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:20.800]   and living a life away from the purpose of God,
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.320]   just living our lives just like everybody else in this world,
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.520]   raise good children,
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:30.360]   often go to church, pay your tithe, do your part,
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.760]   being religious,
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.400]   yet having our hearts far from Him.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:44.600]   See, God left a witness, Enoch, Methuselah, and Noah.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:51.040]   Secondly, God gave opportunities for people to repent.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:56.040]   Not only is Noah's ark serves as a warning to mankind,
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.840]   it's actually an opportunity where God is being patient
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.520]   and calling us to repentance.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:09.080]   120 years, Noah built this ark
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:14.720]   in the middle of nowhere, literally middle of nowhere.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.680]   And you know what it says in Hebrews 11, seven,
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.640]   it says, "In reverence,"
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.720]   when he heard the warning was coming that isn't there yet,
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.200]   "in reverence, he prepared an ark."
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.720]   So why did he build an ark?
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.360]   Well, they don't elaborate.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:32.560]   And in this short statement,
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.280]   basically it says, "Because he believed."
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.040]   God said judgment is coming,
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.440]   the world is gonna be wiped out,
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.160]   and because he believed, he says he feared.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.600]   The word reverence, in some of your translations,
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:44.880]   it says he feared.
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.520]   For whatever the reason,
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.360]   we think fearing God is not biblical.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.640]   That's not Christianity.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.900]   I'm gonna quote Kanye West this morning.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:00.700]   He was being interviewed, right,
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.200]   and asked, "What happened to you?"
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.340]   Now, whether you believe his faith is genuine or not,
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:10.200]   but at least this statement I can't deny.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.260]   And he said, "I fear God.
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:17.880]   "And because I fear God, I don't fear anything else."
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:23.260]   It's like, don't you fear your peers and other people
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.060]   in the entertainment industry, the politicians,
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:28.140]   that you're being called this and you're being called that?
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:29.540]   Do you not know the consequence
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:32.340]   of having that political thing and being religious?
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:34.420]   And he says, "I fear God.
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:38.340]   "And because I fear God, I fear nothing else."
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:43.740]   Noah heard the warning, and he said,
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.340]   because he believed, he feared God.
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:49.940]   In other words, he took it serious.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.660]   He took his warning, he took it serious,
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:53.300]   and that's why he started building this ark.
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:58.300]   This ark was 500 feet long, 85 feet wide, 50 feet high,
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:03.140]   five-story building, even though it had three levels.
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.180]   You know, people often say, it's like,
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.980]   "Oh, could they have fit all the animals?"
[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.940]   In fact, they actually did a study in 2014.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.020]   So there's 34,000 known species that are living in there.
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.180]   This is 2014.
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:17.380]   They said over 90% of the animals
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.460]   that we know of are smaller than cats.
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:22.360]   So he said, just even scientifically,
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.460]   if you were to say, "Was that boat big enough?"
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.740]   He said, "By far."
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.700]   But that's not the point of this story,
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:34.100]   'cause God left that to us as a witness.
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:39.020]   What do you think that Noah did for 120 years
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.380]   while he was building this?
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:45.380]   Why did he even build a boat?
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:50.380]   Why this drama of rain and flood for 40 days and 40 nights?
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:52.060]   I mean, he wanted to save Enoch.
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.500]   What did he do?
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:54.900]   Come up.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:58.780]   Why did he do that with the aid and then just destroy them?
[00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:01.940]   What was the drama of 120 years
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.980]   of building this ridiculous square box
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.800]   in the middle of the desert,
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:10.340]   while for 120 years, enduring the mocking,
[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:12.340]   probably, of all their neighbors?
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:15.160]   Look at that crazy man.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.500]   And this is before power tools.
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.700]   This is before Home Depot,
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:22.100]   where you can go and get nicely cut wood.
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:23.500]   You have to cut down trees,
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.060]   and you have to get it all handmade.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.380]   That's why it took 120 years.
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.380]   For what purpose?
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:31.500]   You know, it's interesting
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:34.380]   that the ark is just a rectangular box.
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:38.660]   It's almost like it wasn't meant to go anywhere.
[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:41.100]   It was just meant to float.
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:44.780]   And God did it on purpose, to leave a witness.
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:46.460]   What do you think he did for 120 years
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:49.100]   when people asked him, "Why are you building that boat?"
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:53.220]   God left a witness for 120 years.
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.420]   Every time they asked him,
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:57.860]   "Hey, God said you're gonna be judged.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:02.620]   God said you're gonna be judged if you do not repent."
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:07.880]   So the 120 years of his labor
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:12.740]   was a physical and verbal witness
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:15.780]   of God pleading with mankind to repent.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:22.100]   Genesis 6.22, "Thus Noah did according to all
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.980]   that God had commanded him, so he did."
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:28.020]   I mean, it's so simple.
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:31.680]   He believed, so he did it.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:39.900]   We've made Christianity so complicated today.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:44.060]   It's almost like if you convert and became a Christian,
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.940]   you have to go to seminary to even understand
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:49.420]   what you're supposed to believe or not believe.
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:51.500]   It's simple.
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.900]   If you believe Jesus, you follow Jesus.
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:58.300]   And you wanna know what he has to say, read the Bible.
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:53:59.940]   You wanna know him, go and pray.
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:05.620]   We have books, seminaries, conferences,
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:09.180]   discipleship, programs, training.
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.420]   Now, I'm not saying any of that stuff is bad,
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.540]   but if you say you're a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.440]   you have to follow Jesus Christ.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.100]   If you say you believe in Jesus Christ,
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.300]   you actually have to believe in Jesus Christ.
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.300]   You can't say you believe that he's the way
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:23.140]   and then not go.
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:27.260]   You can't say that I believe the warning is coming,
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.460]   I believe the judgment is coming,
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.460]   I believe the world is gonna be wiped out
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:34.220]   and to live the rest of your life
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:35.980]   like everybody else in this world.
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:40.340]   That's not Christianity 401.
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:44.620]   That's just basic common sense.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:50.440]   But if you believe in the message that the Bible teaches,
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:54.400]   either you believe it and you follow him
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.440]   or you don't believe it and don't follow him.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:00.040]   But you can't say I believe and then not follow him.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:09.040]   It simply says he believed, he feared, and he did it.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.580]   All of this to leave a witness.
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:18.360]   First Peter 3, 20 to 22, who once were disobedient
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.800]   when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.040]   He kept waiting in the days of Noah,
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.220]   telling them to repent during the construction of the ark
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:31.420]   in which a few, that is eight persons,
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.900]   were brought safely through the water
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.180]   corresponding to that baptism now saves you.
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:38.100]   Not only did he leave a witness to them,
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:40.860]   he left a witness to us of what God was going to do.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:45.260]   That through his death and resurrection in our baptism,
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.260]   he said he was going to save us as well.
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:51.280]   Just like he condemned the world for rejecting him,
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.440]   he will condemn the world.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.260]   And those who believe and are saved through the water,
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:58.100]   just like Noah, we will be saved.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:01.020]   Not the removal of the dirt from the flesh,
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:03.040]   but an appeal to God for a good conscience
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.640]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.020]   who is at the right hand of God,
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:08.400]   having gone into heaven after angels and authorities
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:11.800]   and powers and had been subjected to him.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:15.620]   Can you put up the next slide?
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:22.480]   Yes, I know the room is filled with Chinese Americans,
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.920]   but I'm gonna teach you some Chinese today, okay?
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:30.360]   That's the word for boat, chuan.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.200]   Chuan.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.200]   I was corrected.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.800]   It's not chuan, it's chuan.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.520]   And I know somebody's gonna correct me too after that.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.520]   That's the word for boat in the Chinese character.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.880]   And as you guys know, the Chinese character
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.460]   basically at one point were pictures
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:49.680]   that were made into characters,
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:52.000]   and you could see the meaning of the word.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.120]   You know like we look at English words
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:58.400]   and we do the history of that word
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.380]   and where it came from, so it either came from Greek
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.800]   or Latin or something, and then that's how we dissect
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.680]   the word and say, hey, this is what this word means.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.680]   Well, Chinese characters, it's embedded into their character.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:11.280]   Well, mainland China has been using the simplified version,
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.520]   but those of you who are Taiwanese,
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:17.040]   they still use that old, regular Chinese.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.960]   And this Chinese word for boat are three words,
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.360]   three pictures put together,
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:24.160]   the vessel, number eight, and people.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.560]   If you've ever studied Chinese,
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:28.800]   there's so many words like this.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.040]   In fact, when I took Chinese class,
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   one of the words that really intrigued me was the number six.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:43.000]   So the teacher who was teaching this,
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.240]   she studied Chinese character history,
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.140]   and she was not a Christian.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:48.880]   So she was telling us about the character,
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.240]   and he said the number for,
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:56.240]   oh, the character for man is a number six.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.240]   I said, that's interesting.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.320]   So I went up to her and I said,
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:02.360]   why is the number for man six?
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.520]   She said, I don't know.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.680]   So I said, I know.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:09.760]   So I opened up the Bible and I showed it to her.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.760]   The Bible says the number of man is six.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.600]   And she said, oh, that's interesting.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:14.800]   I mean, there's all kinds of,
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:17.360]   you can go to a website that has a bunch of this stuff.
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:19.800]   Character for righteousness
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.800]   is a character of a lamb over an altar.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.720]   And I asked her that, it's like,
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.740]   why is this character for righteousness?
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:29.560]   Why is a lamb being, you know,
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:33.360]   like offered up over an altar the word for righteousness?
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:35.320]   She's like, I don't know.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.640]   You know, I said, well, this is what the Bible says.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:38.940]   So I got to share the gospel with her
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:40.440]   through these Chinese characters.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.400]   It was interesting, so I don't know.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:45.640]   You know, we could just say it's embedded into the culture,
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:46.840]   it's an ancient culture.
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:47.840]   Obviously, the Chinese culture,
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:50.280]   they've used this language for thousands of years.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.940]   And I don't know how it came in.
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.120]   That's why I always, you know, I'm very skeptical.
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:56.200]   So I thought maybe the missionaries.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:59.160]   I said, they didn't have boats before missionaries?
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.760]   So it didn't make sense, but you know, I'm skeptical.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.360]   But the number six,
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:08.400]   they must have had that from the very beginning.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.920]   Why would that be man?
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.800]   I have my conclusion.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:17.520]   But whether you believe this or not,
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:21.920]   God has left imprints of himself if you are interested.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:25.720]   That's why he calls people to himself.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:28.760]   He said he left evidence of himself in all of creation.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:30.680]   He sent prophets.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:33.440]   He gave us the word of God, the Holy Spirit, all of it,
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.160]   so that if we are interested,
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.960]   if we humble ourselves and seek him out,
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.560]   he'd left imprints.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:43.280]   But the problem is, the Bible says we suppress the truth
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.680]   because we're afraid if we find the truth
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.840]   that all the other things that he said is true.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.140]   But judgment is coming.
[00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:53.720]   That is that you have to pick up the cross as well.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.080]   You have to lose your life as well.
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:00.440]   So if this is true, I don't want this to be true,
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.480]   so neither do I want this to be true.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.760]   And so I suppress the truth
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.520]   'cause I don't wanna receive the consequence
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.840]   of what this means.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.640]   And so we embrace cultural Christianity.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:19.920]   Cultural Christianity is simply jumping through the hoops
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:24.800]   to appease what is expected of whatever church
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.560]   or fellowship that you belong to.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:31.160]   But following Christ,
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:37.640]   following Christ requires us to focus our eyes upon Christ.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:44.560]   And true unity in the church is unity that happens
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.520]   as a result of men and women
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.960]   who are sold out for Jesus Christ.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.280]   Even if we look different,
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.600]   even if we speak different languages,
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.200]   even if it takes us to different parts of the world.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:03.080]   See, God, through Noah, warned them for 120 years
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.880]   that they would return, but they would not.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.360]   Third and finally, by faith,
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:13.480]   God made Noah an heir of righteousness.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:17.960]   Genesis 6, 8, "But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord."
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.720]   And he explains it in this text.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.600]   Noah became an heir of righteousness according to faith.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.080]   You know, whenever we study Hebrews chapter 11,
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:30.360]   we have two ways that we get imbalanced.
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:35.440]   So the first group of people will look at Hebrews
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.280]   and look at all these achievements.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.200]   By faith, look what they did.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.320]   He gave up everything, he built the ark.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.080]   Abraham walked down to the desert.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.760]   Some people lived, some people died.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.880]   Look what they did.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:50.480]   And so some people will read this 11, chapter 11,
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.400]   to challenge whoever that they are challenging.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.800]   Look, we're supposed to do, we're supposed to give our life.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.080]   And then other people will read this text and say,
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.240]   "No, it's by faith."
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.320]   Everyone starts by, "By faith, by faith, by faith."
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.000]   It's not about what they did, it's about faith.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.360]   So stop talking about what we should do
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:16.160]   and just talk about what he did.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.960]   Either extreme is not biblical
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.840]   because the point that he's trying to make is
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.960]   because he believed he did this,
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.400]   the evidence of genuine faith is that they obeyed.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.720]   His salvation didn't come because he worked.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.240]   He worked because he believed.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:43.120]   You can't profess faith and then just go home.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.160]   You can't just profess faith
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.280]   and become a member in the church
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.880]   and then just go home and live like everybody else.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:56.360]   It's not one or the other.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.520]   That's the point that he's trying to make.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.600]   If you profess and there's no evidence of that,
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.880]   it may not be genuine faith.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.280]   And if you think that you're gonna somehow gain righteousness
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.960]   by doing all of this stuff,
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.240]   and yet thinking that somehow you can earn your righteousness
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.440]   is completely unbiblical.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.160]   He's saying, "Noah did all of this because he believed
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.000]   and he became an heir."
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.400]   You know what heir means?
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.800]   Heir means it belonged to somebody else.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.000]   It belonged to somebody else,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.720]   and when that person dies, you get it free.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.840]   You didn't earn that.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:28.680]   That's what he means.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.760]   He became an heir of righteousness.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.160]   He received something that he did not earn.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.600]   That's what he means by this, by faith.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.800]   He became an heir of righteousness,
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.600]   but his faith caused him to build that ark
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.960]   and be a witness for 120 years,
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.440]   telling people about the judgment to come.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:53.120]   What's interesting here is out of all those people.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.160]   Now, we have no idea how many people were there,
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.000]   minimum thousands, hundreds of thousands possibly,
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.520]   for 1,500 years.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.520]   And remember, each one of these guys lived
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.160]   hundreds and hundreds of years,
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:09.000]   meaning they could have had hundreds of kids.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.800]   We don't know that for sure,
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.880]   but just how human beings work,
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.080]   out of all those people,
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.640]   eight people got saved, eight.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:28.000]   That's a pattern that we see all throughout Scripture.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.200]   Remnant, remnant.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.560]   Isaiah 10.21, "A remnant will return,
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.720]   "a remnant of Jacob, the mighty God."
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.080]   A small number.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.000]   That's what he's saying, small number.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.200]   Romans 11.5, "In the same way then,
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.640]   "there has also come to be at the present time
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.920]   "a remnant according to God's gracious choice."
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.120]   A small number, that's what a remnant is.
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:56.000]   Romans 9.27, "Isaiah cries out concerning Israel,
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   "though the number of the sons of Israel
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.640]   "be like the sand of the sea,
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:02.160]   "it is the remnant that will be saved."
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.200]   The remnant, a small number.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.200]   Do you know why this is so important?
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:10.400]   It's because you and I are social creatures.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.840]   So we don't like to be the first ones to do anything.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:19.120]   We usually wait until we see if it's acceptable
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.480]   to the community that we belong to before we move.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.840]   Even when we are being stirred.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.920]   We will wait until the masses come together,
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.680]   then we can speak out, then we can walk,
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.520]   then we can go that direction.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.560]   Because that's our tendency.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.200]   But here's the problem.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:41.640]   Just as he saved the eight among the multitudes,
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.240]   the Bible says that he will do the same at the end.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:48.720]   In Matthew 7.13-14, "Enter through the narrow gate,
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:52.200]   "for the gate is wide and the way is broad
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.800]   "that leads to destruction.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:58.000]   "And there are many who enter through it."
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.800]   You know he's talking about the church.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.800]   You know he's talking about the church.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.360]   Cultural Christianity isn't a lesser Christianity.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.160]   It's not Christianity.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:23.160]   And it is so powerful that we can live all our lives
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.840]   jumping through hoops to belong to whatever church
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:30.840]   that you belong to, and yet you never truly followed Christ.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:36.080]   That's how much power community has.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.040]   You know, when we're young, part of the reason
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:43.040]   why children are cute is because they don't think too much
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.480]   about what other people are gonna think,
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.800]   so they do crazy things.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:49.360]   They're inhibited, uninhibited.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.440]   So they'll walk around naked.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.040]   I mean, they don't realize it yet.
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.080]   Soon as they hit puberty, all of a sudden,
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:59.760]   they're very aware, in fact, hyper aware of their friends.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.960]   They'll cut their hair a certain way,
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.280]   wear tight skinny jeans.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.120]   You know what I mean?
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.680]   You have to have a certain kind of sunglasses,
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.960]   you have to wear a certain brand of shoes,
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.160]   'cause they're hyper aware all of a sudden.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:16.440]   But you know that peer pressure never goes away.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.520]   It never goes away.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:21.400]   It's just your community changes.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.520]   So in your 20s, you have a certain way
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.600]   because that's what your friends do.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.200]   You do certain things, you get certain jobs,
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.720]   you buy certain houses, you buy certain cars,
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.840]   all because of this is what's acceptable.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.680]   That doesn't change.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.120]   You get married and have kids, what do other kids have?
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.720]   How come the other parents are doing this
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.760]   and they have this many children,
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.600]   what do they do, what school do they go to,
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.960]   what kind of jobs do they have?
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.680]   That peer pressure never changes.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.840]   That goes to grandkids.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.000]   I spent a lot of time with seniors when I was teaching ESL.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.960]   It's no different with them either.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:59.440]   You would think that at the age of 70 and 80,
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.760]   they're just kind of coasting along.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.400]   No, they're just older teenagers.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.400]   They have the same problems, comparing.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.760]   A lot of the comparing they do is,
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.200]   what did their kids give you?
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.560]   So they compare the success of their children
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.600]   with other grandparents.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:20.920]   That pressure never goes away.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:26.280]   And so we rise to the expectation of the community
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:28.840]   that we belong to, but we never break out.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:31.880]   We never break out.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.800]   See, cultural Christianity can be easily explained
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.200]   by psychologists and sociologists.
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.960]   Religious people go to church
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.240]   because they need to be comforted.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:49.000]   They want their children to be taught morals.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.120]   They go to church because they need community.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.600]   Because we live in a society where there isn't any community
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.920]   so a lot of people go to church.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:02.080]   So if you happen to run into a non-Christian
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.160]   who is perfectly happy with their family,
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:08.880]   they have community with whatever it is that they have.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.720]   And they feel secure and they're not worried about death.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.560]   I don't need it.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.960]   Because what they are observing is cultural Christianity.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.760]   And so they'll say, I don't need the gospel
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.360]   because they think that's what Christianity is.
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.920]   But the message of the cross and the life
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.400]   that he calls us to makes no sense psychologically
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.640]   and sociologically.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:38.520]   Jesus took rich fishermen and told them to follow him
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:41.680]   and they gave their lives,
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.400]   professing that their savior was resurrected from the dead.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.640]   Apostle Paul, who already was in the top of the world
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.840]   as a Jew, said, no, now you will suffer many things
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.960]   for my name's sake.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.800]   Why would he do that?
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.600]   He already told him, you're living a nice,
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.880]   comfortable life now and from the get-go,
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.760]   God said, I called you to the Gentiles
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.640]   and I will show you how much you will suffer
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.520]   for my name's sake.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:07.000]   He told him he was gonna suffer for his name's sake.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.120]   Why did Paul do that?
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.320]   Because he believed.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.840]   Because he believed.
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:17.680]   See, the biblical Christianity that Jesus calls us to,
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.400]   there is no psychological, sociological answer
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.000]   unless you actually believe that judgment is coming.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.480]   Why would you forsake your comfort?
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.440]   Why would you forsake your careers?
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.800]   Why would you risk the future of your children?
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:36.640]   See, this secular, materialistic world,
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.800]   it makes no sense.
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.720]   Biblical Christianity makes no sense.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.440]   Either you are crazy
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:48.440]   or you actually believe what you profess to believe.
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.280]   There is nothing in the middle
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.280]   'cause everything in the middle
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.680]   is just cultural sociology.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:01.280]   You just happen to have a lot of Christian friends.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.480]   You just happen to be raised in a Christian home.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.840]   Your parents, your grandparents, your great-grandparents
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.640]   happen to be Christians, so you're Christian
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.120]   because the easiest thing to do
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.640]   if you grew up in that culture is to remain there.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.920]   So you happen to run into a bunch of Christians
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.320]   and so they happen to be your best friends.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.520]   So the easiest thing for you to do is to stay in that
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.000]   and in order to stay in that,
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.440]   you just jump through the hoops that they jump through.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.840]   But never following Jesus Christ.
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:36.720]   There's a reason why God calls people out into the desert.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:38.920]   He breaks them away from their community
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:42.120]   and makes them stay alone with God for a period
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:47.240]   'cause God does not call us in communities.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:48.600]   He calls us one by one.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:55.280]   The sociological aspect of modern Christianity
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.640]   that you and I experience is so powerful
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:03.840]   that can easily deceive nominal Christians
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.160]   that we hold on to this community for dear life.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:13.480]   Even when false doctrines are being preached,
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:18.240]   even as it slips, you hold on to community for dear life
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.080]   because what we are following
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.400]   is cultural Christianity and not Christ.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.680]   Let me conclude with this.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:31.320]   I learned this when I was younger back in college
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.360]   and I shared with you
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.960]   because my parents moved around so much,
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.000]   there was a longing in my heart to belong somewhere
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.720]   and I couldn't articulate that when I was younger
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:43.680]   but I realized that that was what was going on in my heart.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.160]   I didn't belong here, I didn't belong in Korea
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.680]   and then right when I was confused, puberty hit.
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.160]   And then right when I was confused, puberty hit.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.640]   Junior high school and that's why
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.640]   I started getting into a lot of trouble.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.440]   And then in the midst of all of that, I became a Christian.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.920]   And when I became a Christian,
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:08.080]   for the first time in my life, I felt I belonged.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:13.000]   I felt like I'm part of his kingdom.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.160]   I'm not American, I'm not Korean,
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.000]   I'm a citizen of his kingdom.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.960]   And so I didn't even realize
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.080]   what was going on in my heart
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.920]   but when that happened, nothing else mattered to me
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.800]   'cause I wanted to belong to this.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.760]   I mean, I practiced baseball,
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.320]   I tried so hard to get on this team
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.080]   and everybody that I knew,
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.640]   instantaneously I lost interest
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.720]   because that's not the community
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.200]   that I wanted to be part of.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.280]   I wanted to be part of this community
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.040]   so I went to their Bible study
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:44.040]   and they spoke Korean.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.960]   My Korean was not that good
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.520]   but I had to learn because that's a community
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.240]   I wanted to belong to.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:53.320]   To this day, I have songs memorized in my head
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.240]   that I don't know what it means
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.080]   'cause I sang it for like four years.
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:59.880]   And then I came to college
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.520]   and there was this campus ministry
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.320]   and my former youth pastor asked me,
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.920]   "Hey, Peter, you wanna be disciple?"
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.560]   And I was, "Yes, that's the reason why I came to Biola."
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.000]   So he started meeting up with me
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.760]   and I didn't realize that he was part
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.680]   of this campus ministry
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:18.880]   and then I started really growing,
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:19.880]   I started getting excited
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.360]   and I joined this ministry
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.200]   and we would have meetings
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.880]   and at that time, I was the youngest guy there
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.720]   and all of my roommates were 10, 12 years older than me.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.080]   But I was elated and all of a sudden,
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.720]   it became a thing at Biola.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.840]   Even though it was a very small campus,
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:38.520]   all of my peers started joining this ministry.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.400]   So even though I was the only one at that time,
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.120]   all of a sudden, six months later,
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.600]   this tiny little ministry of like three or four
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.720]   or five people, it grew to about 50.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:49.840]   All my age people.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.320]   And for the first time,
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.600]   not only did I feel like I belonged in God's kingdom there,
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.240]   I was a physical community.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.320]   I never felt that at church, in neighborhood, anywhere.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.920]   And it was fun.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.840]   Have friends to hang out with,
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.120]   leading worship, praying together,
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.440]   evangelizing together.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.800]   But about eight, nine months later,
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.920]   they all started leaving.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.120]   They started having problems with ministry
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.160]   and then it was no longer the cool thing to do.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.440]   And so as much as they came in all at once,
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.080]   they started leaving all at once.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:26.320]   And I was so tempted because for the first time,
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.640]   I felt like I belonged somewhere
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.160]   and I got a small taste of what it felt like
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.000]   to belong somewhere and then they left.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.720]   And I was so tempted to leave with them
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:41.040]   because for the first time, I belonged.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.160]   And so I was really on the verge of telling my leaders
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.200]   that I'm gonna leave.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:52.360]   But I can't deny what happened with God.
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.600]   And so it was, in me, there was competing
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.520]   with my loyalty to God and this,
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:00.400]   and I was rationalizing, it's the same thing.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.560]   Why can't you have both?
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.720]   And I genuinely was confused.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:08.960]   So I decided that I'm gonna give it six months.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:11.560]   I'm gonna wait six months.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.120]   And if I feel the same way after six months,
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.600]   whatever I'm saying like,
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.960]   oh, I gotta leave 'cause of this and this,
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:18.800]   if I feel the same way,
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.920]   and this isn't just an emotional tug
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.560]   because I wanted to belong to that group,
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.880]   then in six months, it'll be more clear.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:30.880]   Sure enough, six months came and it became crystal clear
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:34.640]   that I needed to stay.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.880]   What I was being challenged by, what I was learning
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.960]   was greater than any fellowship or whatever
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.240]   that I thought I was gonna miss in doing that.
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:44.040]   The reason why I tell you this story
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:48.240]   was because that made such a huge impact in my heart
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.280]   'cause I was already committed.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:53.640]   I was already saying, I'm gonna give my life
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:54.760]   and I'm gonna follow Christ
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:55.600]   and I'm gonna preach the gospel.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.760]   I was already committed.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:01.720]   But that desire to want to belong was so strong
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.520]   that I was rationalizing in my head,
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:09.240]   I can't possibly do this
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:11.200]   or else I'm gonna lose my friends.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.600]   I'm not gonna be able to be a part of this community.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:18.240]   And at the end of all of that, I realized, wow,
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.240]   that pull, that peer pressure is so powerful
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:27.240]   that if I'm not careful, I can live the rest of my life
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.960]   jumping through hoops to try to belong somewhere
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:35.440]   while denying Christ in the name of Jesus.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:44.280]   The truth will always pull us out of our comfort zone.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:49.480]   Don't look around to see if your friends are doing it.
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:53.320]   If you have a community of people to do this with,
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:59.960]   first and foremost, do you believe what the Bible says?
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:08.000]   From my experience, if you follow Jesus genuinely,
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:13.680]   you will experience loneliness
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:15.160]   that you may not have experienced
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.280]   if you weren't a follower of Jesus Christ.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:22.320]   Some of the most intense feeling of loneliness
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.640]   came after I made a decision to follow Jesus.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.720]   As much as I wanted to belong,
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.560]   as much as I desired to belong,
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:36.560]   the feeling of being isolated
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.600]   was never more intense
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.160]   than after I truly committed my life to Christ.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:45.520]   And that's why he became my affection.
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:50.800]   He's more to me than anything else in this world.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:56.280]   Even my wife, even my children,
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:59.760]   'cause they're fallen creatures like me.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:06.000]   I wanna end with this challenge.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   Have we sanitized the gospel like the Noah's Ark,
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.360]   where the punch and the power of the gospel
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.320]   is no longer relevant in your life?
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.040]   You've sanitized it to the point
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:25.200]   where we made a to-do list of things that we do.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.320]   And if you behave this way, if you say certain things,
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:30.040]   if you go certain places, then I'm okay with God.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:35.560]   Yet it does not fit the message of the gospel.
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.640]   It does not fit the message of the cross.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:42.440]   The wrath of God is being revealed
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.840]   against all unrighteousness.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:48.440]   A third of heaven will be wiped out.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.280]   And all of that,
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.640]   all of everything that we see in the book of Revelation
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.920]   is actually God being merciful
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.320]   so that sinners would see that and repent.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:03.240]   But when the end comes,
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.040]   there will be no more salvation,
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:10.200]   only righteousness.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:15.000]   And he will divide between those who are covered
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.560]   and those who are not.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:19.280]   Those who believe, there's those who do not.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.880]   Those who followed, and those who did not.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:27.080]   Broad is the way that leads to destruction.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.720]   Narrow is the gate that leads to eternal life.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.040]   And few will be found in it.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.040]   Please be that few.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.680]   Please be that few.
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:42.920]   Do not let peer pressure keep you in nominal Christianity.
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.920]   Love Christ.
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.160]   Love Christ.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.760]   Love Christ.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:49.600]   Let's pray.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:59.720]   Heavenly Father,
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:03.120]   we pray that the truth of your word
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:06.560]   will not just go through one ear and out the other.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:10.160]   Lord, we pray for revival.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:14.080]   We pray for men and women
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:17.320]   who take your warning seriously
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:21.480]   and embrace the truth of salvation seriously,
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:24.040]   that we may live up to the calling,
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:26.120]   live up to the gospel that you have given us,
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.280]   that we may live worthy
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:30.680]   of what we profess week after week.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:37.240]   Lord, as you warned us that in the end times,
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.400]   that because of the increase in wickedness,
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.720]   the love of many will grow cold.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:44.840]   Help us, Lord God,
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:48.080]   that we would not be a part of that many,
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:51.880]   that we would strive to be the few
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.640]   that believe and act,
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:22:01.160]   that we may also be heirs of righteousness by faith.
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.040]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:08.240]   - Let us all rise as we sing our closing praise.

[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:15.840]   As you encouraged us and exhorted us
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.240]   that we cannot bear any fruit unless we remain in you.
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:24.200]   Lord, teach us what that means, that we may practice it.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:29.400]   That we may see abundant fruit, Lord God, in this generation.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:34.300]   Help us to see the loss through your eyes.
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:38.640]   Help us, Lord God, to grieve
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.480]   for the sins that we see around us.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:45.240]   Help us to have compassion as Christ did
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:46.840]   when he saw the multitudes.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:50.320]   Help us, Lord God, to take action,
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:53.640]   to make disciples of all nations.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:59.200]   We pray, Father God, that we would be men and women
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:03.760]   of true faith, that we would not simply be hearers
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:08.600]   of the words, but we would also do because we believe.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.800]   Lord, show us what that means.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.720]   Help us, Lord God, wherever you send us this week
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.240]   to be the aroma and the light of Christ.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.880]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.200]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
