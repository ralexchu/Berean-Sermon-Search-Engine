[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Yesterday night I gave a very simple definition of what your identity is.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   It's just a simple question, "Who are you?"
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   "Who am I?"
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   And in order to talk about this, the world has various categories to help you piece together
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   your identity.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   And when I say the world, all that the world can do is operate by what they see with their
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   eyes.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   And so they will ask, "What can you do for me?"
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Meaning, "What can you produce?"
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   They will ask, "How do you look?"
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   They'll ask, "What kind of things do you have, like possession?"
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   So I threw out to you all of these categorical things yesterday night.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Purpose, possession, function, value, right?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Usefulness to your community, your looks, approval, all these kind of categories.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And we can just sit there and go through a line of more categories that build your personal
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   identity.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   It's just that all those things happen to be things that operate by sight.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And that's what this world can do.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   They have a certain identity for you because that's what they see.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And so that's why even right now, one of the more popular things politicians and our social
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   generation will look at is your identity groups.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Identity groups based on your race, your demographics of income, your locale, whatever
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   it may be.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And a lot of people, they function just based on your academic or whatever, kind of these
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   socioeconomic statuses.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   So you came out of these kind of schools, you have this kind of career, or you're blue
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   collar, white collar.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   All of those are identifying markers that you can see with your eyes.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So, one route of wrestling through this, I asked you yesterday to examine and ask yourself
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   the question, of all the things that you worry about in terms of your personal identity,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   how much of it is actually related to Christ in any way?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   That was the question in examination yesterday.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   But today, starting from this session, I want to give you at least a path to think about,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   well I can sit there and examine and then start feeling like, oh gosh, there's a lot
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   that doesn't even have anything to do with Jesus.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Or you know what, a lot of it does.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   But then there's a question of how does my identity build?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   What is the path for me to have a solid, good, perfect identity?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And I'm going to start off with a very interesting, interesting question for you.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And this question is, currently right now in your heart and in your mind, what do you
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   want most?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I'd actually do a little exercise with you and I want you to answer the question and
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   write it down on your paper or whatever you're using to take notes.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   What do you currently want most?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And you've got to do it.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Don't be all rebellious.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Participate here and write it down.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And if you're having a hard time, let me help you.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   When I say what do you want most, sometimes it's just intensity.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Meaning, what's something that's just like, oh I just want it so bad, so it's up at a
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   scale like a 1 through 10 scale, it's up at a 9 or something.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Or, it may not be something you feel is like so bad and deep, but it just happened all
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   the time.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   So, just evaluate through the last 10 weeks of your life.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   What was something that just came up in your head again and again?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   What was something that just, you don't even have to force yourself to think about it.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   You have some free time and the next thing you know, you're fantasizing having that.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   So go ahead and write that down.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Good, a good number of you guys are looking up at me, so I'm assuming you're done.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Or, really rebellious.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Just kidding.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Now, I want you to take a look at that and sometimes, I just don't want you to overthink
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   it because instinctually, sometimes we start judging.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Like, oh gosh, should I even want this?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Oh gosh, is it like shameful?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Is it godly?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And you overthink it.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   So, in order as an exercise to combat our overthinking, self-evaluating nature, just
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   go ahead and show the person next to you what you are missing.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I'm just kidding.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   So guys, it's huge.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Oh my gosh.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Just kidding.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Okay.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Now, the reason why I did this about your design, I apologize if some of you guys are like,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   "Oh, you told me so I did it."
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Now, the reason why I did that is because in building your identity, like actually taking
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   steps to solidify what your identity is, the scriptures actually teach us that God judges
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   you based on what you want most.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And when I say that, remember the question I had.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Who are you?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Who are you?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Do you happen to be a 25-year-old, what are some big categories?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Caucasian, engineer.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   You're an engineer, I understand.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I'm looking around at you and you're just looking at us.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   You're not 25, I'm 30, I forget.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I just think you're always a little older than I am.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Sorry to single you out there, Star Wars fan.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   pseudo nerd.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Whatever it may be that just pops out at you, is that you?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I can do the same thing the world does, which is look and then just start calling stuff
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   out that I see.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   But God, because He does not judge based on the way that man does.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   You guys remember when the whole ordeal with King Saul was happening, God was very disappointed.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Why?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   King Saul was a head and shoulders above everybody, literally.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   He stood so tall that people literally were looking up to him and then what's more, they
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   presumed he had authority, power, and strength.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   He had all the charisma, he had all the pedigree, and so they said make him our king and God
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   was very disappointed.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Do you recall what he said?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   "Man judges by sight, I look into the heart."
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   What am I saying?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Point number one of this sermon is, I judge you based on your desire.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I judge you based on your desire.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Meaning, your identity is built on your desire.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   What you long for and what you desire is a basic building block of your identity.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   We can talk about purpose, we can talk about function, we can talk about production, possession
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   and value, all those kind of things.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Those things are very important, but I want you to think of it like this.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   If there are smaller details, those are those things.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Purposes, goals, ambitions, whatever it may be.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   But then, an overarching criteria or overarching category is just the simple desires of your
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   heart.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   What do you want?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And that builds, that builds who you are.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Let me give you, let me give you an example.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   A worldly example, a more like just humanistic example is this.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Now, I apologize ahead of time, you guys know, you guys have heard my preaching before, I
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   give a lot of like dating examples, you know.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Not just because of this context, I just think it's funny to talk about.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   So, I typically, and I give a lot of counsel on it, so that's why I give it.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Here's an example, alright.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Imagine I'm meeting with this guy Frank, and this Frank comes up to me and says, "Pastor
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Warren, Pastor Warren, I'm totally into this one girl."
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I'm like, "Who?"
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   "It's Franny."
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   "Franny?"
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   He's like, "Yeah, super into Franny.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   I want to ask her out.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   What do you think I should do?"
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And I was like, and typically the number one question I ask is, "Why do you like her?"
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And then so Frank goes, "Because Franny is fantastic."
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I'm like, "What?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   You think she's fantastic?"
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And then he goes, "Why, you don't think she's fantastic?"
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And I say, "No, you know why?
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Because Franny, she flicks on church.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   She kind of flaunts what she has.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Even a little bit of her body, she flirts with other girls.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   She's not fantastic.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Why do you think?"
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   What did I say?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   You got me.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   You got me.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Anyway, let me just carry on with my example, okay.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Pastor Warren's assessment, Franny is not fantastic.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And then so, listen to the punchline, okay.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Listen to the punchline, right.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I tell Frank, I'm like, "Dude, did you see what I see?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Why do you think she's fantastic?"
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   And then Frank finally admits, "Because she's fine."
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Alright.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And then I said, "Oh my gosh.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   You're so superficial."
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   What did I do?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   I judged him based on his desires.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Right?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   When you have superficial, shallow desires that doesn't care for the things that are way valuable,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   what do I say?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   I judge you.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Because of your superficial desires, I judge you as superficial.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   That's how the world works.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   But what's more, that's how God works.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   God regularly points the finger at our heart and asks you, "What do you want in your heart?
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   What do you want?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   What do you see with your eyes?"
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And then therefore you say, "I want that."
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And then he judges you.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Here's an example.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   What's really interesting is, Turn Your Bibles over to John chapter 6.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Jesus is teaching the masses.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Jesus is teaching the crowds.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And there was a huge crowd that gathered and they all traveled far and wide to hear Jesus.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Now, they came to hear Jesus, but they also came for other stuff.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Why?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Because what they heard was that Jesus not only had these great teachings, but he was
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   also performing an amazing miracle.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   He was feeding 5,000 people in one shot.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   He was feeding all these individuals.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And so guess what happens is, in the Gospel of John it recounts how all these people were
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   fed, and then the next day Jesus actually went across the sea, and then he went off by himself
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   and the people woke up and were like, "Oh my goodness, where is he?"
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And then so a bunch of people started following him.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Now turn your eyes to John 6 verse 26, and then he says this.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   As they're following him, they even take boats and they go across and they go chase him down.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   They're pursuing him.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   You might have been thinking, or when you're reading it, you're thinking, "This is pretty
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   amazing," because now he has a huge following.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   It's like having a million subscribers or something, right?
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Jesus turns and says in verse 26, "He answered them and said, 'Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   you seek me not because you saw signs, but because you ate the loaves and were filled.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Do not work for food which perishes, but for food which endures to eternal life, which
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   the Son of Man will give to you.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   For on him, the Father, God has sent his seal.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Therefore they said to him, 'What shall we do that we may work the works of God?'
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   And Jesus answered and said to them, 'This is the work of God, that you believe in him
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   whom he has sent.'
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   So they said to him, 'What then do you do for a sign, so that we may see and believe
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   you?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   What work do you perform?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, 'He gave them bread out
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   of heaven to eat.'
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   And Jesus then said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   you the bread out of heaven.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   It is my Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.'"
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   In that interaction, there is this incredible convicting rebuke and the people don't get
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   it.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   You see that, right?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   There is this interaction where the people follow and Jesus turns around and says, "You
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   know what?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   You're not coming because you see and you believe.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   You're coming because I fed your stomach.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Knock it off."
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And then the people go, "Well, before Moses did it, now what are you going to do?"
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Essentially, they're saying, "Do it again."
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   "You want us to believe?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Then feed us again."
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   That's pretty much their response.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Why is that such a rebuke?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Because it reveals what they want.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Right?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   It reveals what they were looking for.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And so clearly, the reason why, the motivation, the desire in their heart as to why they were
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   actually going and chasing Jesus was completely off and they didn't get it.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And so then what?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   And later on as you walk through the Gospels, Jesus rebukes the entire generation.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Right?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   You guys remember that.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Every time you walk through the Gospels, Jesus says, "This generation is a perverse and wicked
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   generation."
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Why?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Because they keep seeking signs, wonders, and miracles and the other people who think
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   they're even holier, all they want is knowledge.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   They don't want Jesus.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And so He judges them.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   "You're perverse.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   You're wicked."
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Why?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Why am I bringing this up?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   It's because again, the great challenge, the great crisis of identity is not so much the
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   things you can see with your eyes.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   We're then operating completely on a different platform than where God is operating.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Do you see that?
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   One of the most essential things about our identity happens to be in here.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   What does your heart desire and long for?
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   What do you want?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And by it, God sees and begins to judge.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   This is who you are.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Now, a more biblical thing we can do is something really odd and interesting.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Let's take a moment to judge Christ.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   That sounds weird, right?
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Please turn your Bibles over to John chapter 17.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   The passage that I had you guys read in the Golden Age.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   [Pause]
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And as you take a look over at John chapter 17, the passage I had asked you guys to read,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   let's see here.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   [Pause]
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Just for the sake of, well, we're just going to read a big chunk of it, okay?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   We're going to start from verse 13.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   And what I'd like you to do is if you highlight, you do those like marking stuff, sometimes
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   you read it over and over again for certain emphasis.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   I'm going to ask you this question.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Judge Jesus based on what He wants.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Right?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   We're saying the desires of your heart start to define who you are.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Let's take a moment to assess and evaluate.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Maybe I should use a different word so it's more simple.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Let's just simply observe and appreciate what is the desire of Christ's heart.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   And therefore conclude who is He.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Take a look at verse 13.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   "But now I come to you and these things I speak in the world so that they may have my
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   joy and be full of themselves."
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   So that they may have joy.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Verse 14, "I have given them your word and the world has hated them because they are
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one."
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Jesus wants their protection.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Sanctify them in the truth.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Your word is truth."
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Jesus wants their sanctification.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   "As you sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth."
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Jesus wants their sanctification to the degree that He would sanctify Himself, which is crazy
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   to even think about.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   But you know what He's saying.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   When He says to sanctify Himself, He is going to go through all sorts of pain and suffering.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Verse 20, "I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in me
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   through their word, that they may all be one, even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you sent me."
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Jesus desires oneness.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Verse 22, "The glory which you have given me, I have given to them, that they may be
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   one just as we are one."
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   What?
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Jesus wants to share His glory.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   "I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected in unity, so that the world may
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   know that you sent me, and love them even as you love me."
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Father, highlight this you guys.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I desire that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   So that they may see me, my glory which you have given me.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   For you love me before the foundation of the world.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   I don't even know where to begin with that, but pretty much there's so much to say.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   He says, "I want to share with the entire world the perfect love you've given me, and
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   I want that with me here now."
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   What?
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   "O righteous Father, although the world has not yet known you, but I have known you,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   and these have known that you sent me, and I have made your name known to them, and will
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   make it known, so that the love with which you love me may be in them, and I in them."
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   I mean, we could just camp down here and just dwell on this for a while, right?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   If you read Jesus' prayer, us knowing that this is not a moment of peace for Him, this
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   is a moment of His greatest anguish.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   This is a moment, if you can just say it in a more colloquial way, He should be stressed
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   out, right?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   But here and now, Jesus' heart is revealed.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   And this is why we could sit and say, "Our Lord is beautiful.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   He has a selfless image.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   His heart and His intention is kind."
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Why?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   He wants to share the perfect love that He has with God Almighty, and He wants to give
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   it to us.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   He desires, He says, to be with us.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Not to simply approve us from afar, not to simply release us from the prison and then
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   let us go free.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   He wants to be one, perfect union.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And there comes then our assessment, "Lord, You are amazing."
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Because this is the desire of the heart revealed to us, right?
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   My point simply was, your desires define and start to build your identity.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Do you see that?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Now, the reason why your desires, even more so, define who you are, is because your desires
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   reveal what you believe, how you judge, how you interpret the world, what you think is
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   good.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Which brings me to my second point.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   So point one was, your desires judge who you are.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Point two is, your desires reveals what you believe is completeness.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Now, let's kind of all over repeat it.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Your desires reveal your belief about what is completeness.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   All I'm saying is this, it's this very simple point which I think you already know by intuitively,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   that when you want something, that means you believe it's good.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Right?
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   You don't want things that are junk.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   You don't want things that are useless.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   You want it because you have placed it in some value and you think that is good for you.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Now, the nuanced way that I've told it to you is this, you want X because you believe
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   X is going to complete.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Right?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   You want something because you believe that's going to be to you some kind of fulfillment,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   some kind of wholeness, that when you have it, then you will actually be living on a higher standard.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   You desire stuff because it's going to take you to that next level, getting closer to what you believe is wholeness.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   The complete mark of it.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Reaching my full potential.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Having everything I was meant to have.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   That's why you want what you want.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Can I tell you something really interesting?
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Listen, even people who are wicked, vile, and heinous, they operate the exact same thing.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Do you think people are doing wicked, vile things because they believe like, "Ugh, this is so painful, bad, and horrendous.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   That's what I want to do."
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   No.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Even wicked people, what they do, they believe it's good.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   They might see that it has bad consequences, whatever, but they think it's a necessary thing.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Come on now, Thanos, how do you pronounce his name?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   The guy with the purple face?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   You don't think he thought in his head like, "This is what needs to happen.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Everybody is a coward.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Only I have the courage to do what's necessary."
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And now you have this movie that sells biblical threads.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   That's how the world works.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Biblical example.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Turn your mind to Romans chapter 1, verse 28-32.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Romans chapter 1, verse 28-32.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   The scriptures talk about how we operate.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And remember, my point is, the reason why your desires reveal who you are is because it also reveals your belief.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   You only want that which you have already judged as good.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Take a look at this.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Romans 1, 28-32, describing the fallen world, the sinful nature of mankind.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   He says, "And just as they did not see fit," okay, I like that, "they did not see it fit to acknowledge God any longer."
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   So God gave them over to a depraved mind to do those things which are not proper.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   "Being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, they are gossips, slanders, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   adventures of evil, disobedient to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful, and although they know the ordinance of God,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval of those who practice them."
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   What does that mean?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   What that means is they have judged in their mind and in their heart.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   This is not fitting and good to give God worship.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   That's just like modern day people who are rejecting God.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   God's not that horrible.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   God's not righteous.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   You know what's more righteous?
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   What's more righteous is my human love to this land.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   What's more righteous is what I think is right.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   No wicked individual sitting there thinking, "No, no, no, I'm wrong. Yes, I'm wrong, but I'm doing it anyway."
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   They're thinking, "No, this is good."
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And then when they see other people do wicked stuff, it's like, "Good job."
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   That's the world.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   What am I talking about, you guys?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   What I'm talking about is this.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   Based on the stuff that you have already deemed valuable and good, that's how you are operating.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   And so what needs to happen is a radical removal of your mind.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   What needs to happen is a breaking down in humility of your own judgment and assessment of your circumstances and who you are.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Now, before I get any further, I do want to hit a really important point.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   This is point number three.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Point number one, your desire to judge who you are.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Point number two, your desire to judge who you are because it shows your belief system.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Point number three, this is what I like to call the common fallen condition.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   You guys don't hear me say it enough.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   This is the conviction of a fallen nature and the fallen way in which we think.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   And this part is a little bit long, so I need you guys to track with me here.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Number one, I don't think the crisis of identity is you forgetting who you are.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   I think you know exactly who you are.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   That's point number three A.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Point number three A is I think you know exactly who you are, but B, you're not happy with it.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   You know it's not complete.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   The reason why you constantly look for stuff that you think is going to take you to that next level
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   is because you know instinctually you're not complete.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   You're not whole.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   However, C, the common fallen condition is that rather than ditch my earthly identity,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   rather than ditch this already sunken cost of an endeavor to try to redeem myself,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   we actually desperately try to save our human identity.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   I know that's a lot, so I'm going to review it.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Number one, I believe you know your identity.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Number two, you're not happy with it.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Number three, you're desperately trying to save it.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Do you guys get that?
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   I think you know exactly who you are.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Some people are like, "Oh, you know, I just forgot.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   I just forgot who I was."
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Oh, come on, dude.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   That's like every other moral story ever written.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   You guys have seen Thor?
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   So Bia and I sometimes we just do the free Netflix account for a month or whatever and then
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   we see this Thor Ragnarok.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Everybody else is like, "Let's watch this."
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   We watch it.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   It's like good action entertainment, but then once I actually think about the plot,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   I'm just sitting here like, "This is fucking horrible."
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   Now the reason why--you can watch that stuff, it's fine.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   But the reason why--I tell you this is so silly.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Thor is getting beat up.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   He's like, "Blah, blah, blah."
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   He's like, "Blech."
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   There's blood coming out of his eye and stuff.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And all of a sudden he sees a vision of his father.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   He's like, "Who are you?"
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   And he's like, "Who are you?"
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   "I'm a god."
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   "God of what?"
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   "God of thunder."
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   "God of what?"
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   "That's right, God of thunder."
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   And next thing you know electricity starts coming out of his face and his arms and his
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   chest plates and then it kills everybody.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   And then you're sitting there like, "That's the lamest plot ever."
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Now people eat that up, you know why?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Because they're like, "Yeah, power is right here, deep inside.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   I'm a god."
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   So stupid.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   The world eats that up because there's a subtle belief.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   "That's right.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   There's a great potential in you and you forgot that."
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   No, that's not what the Bible says.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   The Bible doesn't say you just have to forget that there's a great potential in you.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   But we love to believe that.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And number two, remember my point was you're just not happy with what you see.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   The crisis of identity isn't like, "Oh my gosh, I don't know who I am.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   I know exactly who I am.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   I'm like an incredibly stereotypical Asian man with like five, seven and a half, five
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   eight, barely.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   I have short limbs and what else about me?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   I'm 36, kind of slightly losing my hair.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   I can describe myself.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   It's not like I forget who I am.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   But what is my crisis of identity?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   I wish I was a little bit taller.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   That's my crisis of identity.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   I see who I am.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   I just am afraid.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   There's no signification.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   There's no me.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   I'm just like everybody else.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   But my parents told me I'm special.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Like that's my crisis of identity.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   What's my point with all that?
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   You know, yesterday I started giving all these very tangible examples of academic hopeful,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   athletic hopeful, romantic hopeful.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   What were you hopeful in?
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   What's really interesting about this is there are people who actually got what they hoped for.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   They actually got all of it.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   There are people in this world who got the highest grades, went to the best schools,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   they had the romantic love of their life, and they enjoyed it.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   And then they had tons of money and they also had skills to pick a bit of it.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   They had all of it.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   They had all of it.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   One of those individuals was King Solomon.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Right?
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   And you guys remember what he said?
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   He said, "I see this vanity where I did not limit myself in anything."
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   You redo that.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   He literally says, "I actually explored to the extent that I possibly could.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Like I did everything that I could to get as much as I can.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Pleasure, money, people."
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And you know he did it.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Supposedly he had like 400 wives and a thousand complicated vows.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   It's crazy.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Okay.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Even when he had all that, he says, "I see this vanity because he feels incomplete."
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   I'm going to read you.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   You don't have to turn it for the sake of time.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Just listen to this.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   "There is an evil which I see under the sun.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   It's prevalent among men.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   A man who has been given riches, wealth, honor, so his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   and yet he has not the power to eat of them.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   And everybody else enjoys them.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   This is vanity and severe affliction."
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   What does he say?
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   This is crazy.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Right?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   "I've done everything but I'm still in control and my desire is not fulfilled."
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   He's not satisfied.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   That's exactly what he says.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Why am I talking about this?
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   It's because the fallen condition of man is that sequence of thought I just told you.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   You didn't just simply forget.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   You know who you are.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   But you know that both biblically and humanistically, meaning you don't have to have studied the
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Bible to know that you're incomplete, that you're broken, that you're lacking.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   But your flesh doesn't want to accept that.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And you're desperately trying.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   If you've ever said any of these things, this means yes, you've had a question of identity.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   And this also means yes, rather than ditch, ditch the broken human identity that God has
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   already said needs to die, you're trying to preserve it.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   If you said stuff like, "You know what?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   All I need is just a little bit more time.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   All I need is just a little more support.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   All I need is just another opportunity.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   I just haven't been given a chance."
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Well, good for you.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   That means you can do it without Jesus.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Right?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   If you've ever complained like that, like, "I just haven't been given an opportunity
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   to showcase what I can do."
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Don't say that.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Jesus has challenged us.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   That old Mark Lin, who I think requires just more money, time, opportunity, and people
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   to be improved, that old Mark Lin actually needs to die.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   So here's application number one.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Right?
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Here's application number one.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Application number one is that you need to cease and desist.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Cease and desist from trying to establish your own identity.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   That's, I mean, that's not something new and novel to you, meaning like you've never heard that.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   But isn't that one of the number one challenges of Christian life?
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   We're so inclined.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   We're so inclined to not be disappointed in myself.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Right?
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   There are moments when you're just like, "Oh my, I surprise myself at how simple I am.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   I surprise myself at how forgetful I am."
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   It's not like you've never heard this sermon before.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   How many times have you heard this sermon before?
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Right?
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   You've heard this before.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   And then you're just like sometimes so disappointed and frustrated with yourself.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   "How come I'm so thick-headed and I don't get it?"
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   You know what I've learned?
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   I've kind of learned not to be so surprised and shocked at myself, but fully accept and
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   to stop and cease to be so defensive.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   "No, no, no.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   I'm not that childish.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   No, no, no.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   I don't have this kind of weird, like sinful intent.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   It's all good intention in here.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   It just so happens I make mistakes."
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   That's not true.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   I've completely accepted the fact when God judges here inside.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Right?
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   For example, children.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   When you call them out on something, "What did you do?
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   That was wrong."
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   You know?
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   They say, "I'm sorry I didn't mean it."
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Right?
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   The Bible comes along and says, "You meant it!"
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   You know?
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Just kidding.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   The Bible's not like that.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   It's like a heart.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   Right?
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   You've got to check your heart.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   And then you realize, "Well, to be honest, I had like this sinful desire to want that
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   stuff and that's why I did it.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   I was so afraid and that's why I did it.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   I was so concerned.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   What would this mean about your judgment of me?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   So that's why I did it."
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Children.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   The kind of immaturity we have.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   A lot of times, so defensive.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   "No, no, no.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   I just made a mistake.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   I didn't mean to."
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Or we get even more bombastically defensive.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   "I knew you were a fool to make a mistake.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   I knew you!"
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Right?
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   My challenge number one is stop being so defensive.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Accept the fact that so much of us, the Bible wants to change and sanctify to the measure
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   that is Christ.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Every single aspect of you.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Not only your actions, your words, your behaviors, and all that kind of stuff, but your internal
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   thoughts, your belief system, what you deem is good, your judgment of the world, your
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   circumstances, all of that is up for sanctification.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Amen?
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   And the great challenge for us as Christians in finding our identity is to first stop and
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   cease and desist from trying to save that previous Mark Lin.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   That previous individual.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   "No, no, no.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   He wasn't that bad.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   All he needed was..."
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   No.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Old Mark Lin needs to die.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Old Mark Lin needs to die.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Application number two then, I want to challenge every single one of you.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   You saw in John 17 what Jesus wanted.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   He wanted your character.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   He wanted your character to be sanctified by truth.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I think when I was younger, I struggled a lot.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Like, I want to glorify God.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   I want to love Him and I want to preach about Him, exalt Him.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   But man, I'm not a pastor.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   And I was trying to work and study.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   So, trying to work and study.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   And I talked to some of you guys.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Some of you guys work like 10 hours, 12 hours, 14 hours a day.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And you might be sitting there like, "Oh my, I know I should be all about Jesus.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   I'm investing all of my time into work.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Like, what gives?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Is it even possible to be about Jesus when I give literally three-fourths of my life to work?"
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Do not equate false equations.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Right?
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Do not confuse that kind of investment of time into a task as your Godliness.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   And it goes both ways.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   God wants to see your character sanctified in your work.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   How you do it, why you do it, and what for.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Right?
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   And so what I'm telling you right now is you saw Jesus' heart
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   wanting to see you sanctified with truth.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   You saw that He wanted you to have fullness of joy in Him.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   And you saw that He wanted you to be perfectly united.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   That the way you look, appear, the way you talk and speak,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   the way that you feel and behave, all of these things would measure to that of Christ.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Turn your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 4.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Okay?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Ephesians chapter 4.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Verse 11 through 16.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   The Apostle Paul says exactly the same thing, just in different terms, in different words.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And he gives to us what we should apply ourselves to.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Verse 11.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   "And he gave some to be apostles and some to be prophets and some as evangelists,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   and some as pastors and teachers for the equipping of the saints for the work of service to the building up of the body of Christ."
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   This is your prototypical passage on church discipleship.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   This is your passage on how church structure should be.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   But today I want you to highlight and circle the idea of what you should see as your number one desire.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   Okay?
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And so that really is the application number two.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Send your desire on this.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   He says, "For the building up of the body," verse 13, "until we all attain to the unity of faith
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   and the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ."
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   You should highlight that.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   "To the mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   As a result, we are no longer to be children tossed here and there by waves and carried about by everyone with doctrine,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   by the trickery of men, by the craftiness and deceitful scheming.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the Head and in Christ,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every choice applies according to the proper working of each individual part,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   cause the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   Let me put it this way as an excerptation.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   I didn't know how to necessarily summarize it.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   This second application that I'm talking about, where you set your desire on this, right?
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Let me ask you this question.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   We're talking about how your desires judge who you are, how your desires review your thoughts.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   So think about the ramifications of that.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Do you understand that your completeness, do you understand that your fullness comes from the full measure of Christ?
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   And therefore, did you, upon believing that, set your heart and your mind upon it?
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Right?
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Did you have moments in your life, I know sometimes like,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   you don't want to say lofty, big, high words.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   When people pray like that, maybe it even annoys you.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   "Oh majestic, heavenly, wonderful Father, I commit all my ways to You."
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Amen.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   And you're just like, "Okay, drama boy."
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   Right?
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   It just sounds so lofty.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   But that's my question to you though.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   I'm not asking you to just make lofty statements.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   I'm asking you though, is that what you want?
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   And have you voiced that to God?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Even if you're all shameful to say it, and you feel like, "I don't have the confidence, I don't have the clarity of conscience to be like,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   'God, I love You with everything I've got, and You are my complete, whole fulfillment in life.'"
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Maybe you don't have the full clarity of conscience to say that.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   It bothers you.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Let me then speak to you for a moment here.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   I'm going to wrap this up with this, you know.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   This is our test of faith.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   This is our test of trust.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   This is the Christian struggle.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   You don't have to raise your hands.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   How many of you guys have fallen to the same sin over and over again?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   I have.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Really frustrated.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   There's a temptation when that happens.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   You are going to be tempted to lower your standard and bar, to lower your goal, to lower your expectation,
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   to not want the full measure of Christ, the maturity of Christ, the standard that God has designed in His perfect Son.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   That is not the maturity standard you're going to be shooting for anymore.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   You're going to be tempted to lower that bar and say, "This is what's possible given my limitations."
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Look at how many times I've fallen to the exact same sin over and over and over again.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   And so by sight, you're going to set your bar right here.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   I want you guys to talk about it in your discussion groups.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Have you settled in any way and believed certain measures of standards were okay?
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   That you know are far, very far from Christ?
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Because of your fear, because of your shame, did you lower the bar? That's my question.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Because you're looking at your life, you're looking at what's normal for most people who are sinners,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   you're looking at your traffic period, and you think God's going to be okay with that.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   My challenge to you right now is we're talking about your desire by trust in Christ,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   that He who began a good work within you, He who is going to work through you and in you,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   He who authored everything is going to bring you to completion, even if you feel frustrated.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   And you set your desire up here, because that's what God has designed the church to be.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   That's why He put pastors and evangelists in place.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   That's why He's given you brothers and sisters, to not be discouraged, but by faith, "I trust you, Lord."
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   And my heart is set on your sin.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Do I see incompleteness in me? Yes.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   I've accepted this fact. Mark Lynn, without Jesus, is a wretched being.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   He's a wretched being.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   And I'm not going to sit here all ashamed, asking you to not look.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   But rather, I'm actually going to invite you down.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   I'm going to invite my brothers and sisters.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   Look, I need more of Christ in me.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   And that to me is my completeness.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   So God, I want you. I want your rebuke.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   I want your challenge. I want you to test me.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   And I'm not going to be on the fence of telling you, "Well, that's not me, and I'm an introvert."
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   "Well, that's not me, I'm shy." "Well, that's not me, I'm timid."
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   That's not Jesus' point, is it?
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   He's not trying to get you to extrovertedness.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   He's not trying to get you to be some kind of individual you're not trying to be.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   He's trying to get you to the full measure of Christ.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   And the question at hand is, have you completely adopted it?
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   Have you set your heart on it? Have you set your desire on it?
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   And that to you has become your driving force and motivation.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   That's it.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   And so Apostle Paul says, in Colossians 1, verses 20-29,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   "And that's why we proclaim Him, abonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   so that we may present every man complete in Christ.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   For this purpose I labor, striving according to His power, which mightily works within me."
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   "Which mightily works within me."
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   By way of conclusion, all I want to say is this.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   When I said just a moment ago that this is going to be your battle as a Christian,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   this is going to be a regular occurrence in your life.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   You're going to be unsatisfied with your human identity that you can see with your eyes.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   But God is asking you to buy into Christ's priestly prayer in John chapter 17.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   And He is going to sanctify you with this truth.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   And for you, it is then going to be an impetus.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Are you going to be a surrendered individual who is not setting your eyes upon your own deficiencies
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   and accepting your patterns of life?
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   But rather, are you going to exercise faith, looking at Christ, looking at His perfection,
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   and saying, "That perfect person, Jesus Christ, is going to be my perfect identity."
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Let's take a moment to pray.
