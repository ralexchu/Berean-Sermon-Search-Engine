[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080]   You do have desire for God, that is there.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.080]   Will it always be there?
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:16.200]   That will fluctuate.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.760]   You're going to see that this is different than just sitting at the drawn line between
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.520]   heaven and hell and hearing about God, hearing about humans, hearing about Jesus, and just
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.520]   mentally assenting.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.480]   I kind of believe that over there.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.120]   Assenting brings you right up to the throne of God and you say, "Give it to me.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.880]   I need you."
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.880]   That's what that is.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.040]   A word you could think is, "Enter through the narrow gate."
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.120]   In Matthew 7, verse 13, it says that.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.120]   It says, "Enter by the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.240]   to destruction, and those who enter by it are many."
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.400]   I think there are a lot of people who are standing right up against that gate.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.200]   They say, "I believe," and even with all their hearts, they say, "I want that."
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.600]   Then it's just like, "Man, I wish I could go around pushing people through those gates."
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.360]   Then go.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.720]   Walk.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.600]   Make that decision.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.600]   Do it.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.840]   Stop thinking like, "Oh, then what do I have to do to be saved?"
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.400]   Enter.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:29.360]   It's leave your baggage behind and take up Christ.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.440]   You need to leave the world and enter the kingdom.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.360]   This is the step of faith that trusts.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.640]   There's a guy named Steve Lawson, I like the way he put it.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.280]   This is kind of like when you're at the gates of an airplane.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.600]   You go into the plane, or you stay off of it.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.600]   That's it.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.320]   There's no staying in the middle kind of thing.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.000]   This plane is about to take off.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.200]   Get in the plane.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.240]   You make this decision.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.480]   Another way to think about it is found in Isaiah chapter 55 verse 1.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.480]   That word is come.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.120]   Here's the next slide here.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.120]   Come.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.520]   Isaiah 55 verse 1 says, "Come, everyone who thirsts.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.520]   Come to the waters.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.360]   And he who has no money, come, buy and eat.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.240]   Come buy wine and milk without money and without price."
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.960]   Pastor Mark's teaching still got stuck in my mind of what it means.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.320]   You want to ... Man, Pastor Mark, that idea of Black Friday, it's stuck in my mind.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.440]   You want something, you trample people to get it.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.280]   There was this time where Tri-Tip was on sale before Memorial Day weekend.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.280]   I was at Ralph's.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280]   It was all gone.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.720]   Everyone was waiting for the butcher to come out with this crate.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   I was standing there waiting for it too.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.720]   I was getting pushed.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.240]   By the time this guy came out with the thing, people were pushing each other and grabbing
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.240]   for it and things like that.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.360]   I was like, "Dude, that's totally ... Pastor Mark, you're right.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.760]   We should be doing this.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.940]   If we understand God, humanity, Jesus, we're in trouble.
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.940]   We need him."
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.960]   He's like, "Give that to me."
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.680]   A question we should be asking as we're going through all of this, and the last one, let's
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.000]   go through this one first before I get to that.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.560]   It's forsake, letter either.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.560]   Forsake.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.640]   Luke 14, verse 26 through 27 says, "Deny yourself, take up your cross and follow him."
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.440]   It's saying, "Deny everything about who you are.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.360]   Now take up your cross and follow the one that you love."
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.240]   Follow him.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.820]   If you're thinking right now, "Am I genuinely converted?
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.320]   Am I actually saved?"
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.540]   Question to you, "Have you repented of your sin and have you crossed over?
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.920]   Have you made that decision or have you been at the line staring at everyone else do it?
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.360]   Have you been standing at the line and thinking, "Dude, that looks so good.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.360]   I kind of want that.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.080]   I've been living here, trying to live like that, but I haven't actually crossed over
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.240]   into there and therefore I have no assurance of my salvation."
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.240]   Have you repented?
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.200]   It gets us into our second point here, belief.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.800]   In Acts chapter 16, verse 31 says, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   You and your household."
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   Clear.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   Clear.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   Crystal clear.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.000]   Believe, saved.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.760]   So easy.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   First one, there's knowledge.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.760]   You need to have knowledge.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.960]   That's what belief is.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.040]   Knowledge of who Christ is and what he has done for us.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.640]   In Romans chapter 10, verse 14 and in 17, it's done through the word of Christ.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.040]   "How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed?
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.520]   And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard?
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.360]   And how are they to hear without someone preaching?"
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.240]   So faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of Christ.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.920]   It's a knowledge, it's an understanding that comes through the word of God.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.920]   You hear it.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.920]   So in belief, you do need it.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.640]   You need the knowledge part.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.360]   So for those of you who are walking around saying like, "Oh, they're going to understand
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.640]   who Christ is by my life that preaches."
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.640]   That's true.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.640]   But not all the way.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.640]   You need to preach it.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.640]   They need to hear it.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.640]   They need the knowledge.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.920]   You need the knowledge.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.920]   Many of you guys here already have this knowledge.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.320]   But knowledge alone is not enough.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.400]   And we see that in James chapter 2, verse 19.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.880]   We've already stated this as well, but it's like standing at the line in James 2, verse
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.240]   19, it says, "You believe that God is one.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.240]   You do well.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.240]   Even the demons believe in shudder."
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   They have knowledge.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.240]   That's not enough.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.960]   Secondly, it brings us into agreement.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.960]   That is approval.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.100]   Approval.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.280]   You can't believe in Christ without approving and agreeing to the knowledge that's presented
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.200]   to you.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:45.320]   You need to say, "I believe this."
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.520]   And this knowledge that comes to you, there's a steady growing of agreement of this knowledge
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.520]   that's pouring in.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.720]   So you're reading through scripture?
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.080]   Praise the Lord.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.640]   As that's happening, what needs to be happening is your heart comes more and more in line
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.640]   with what you're reading.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.640]   The truths that you see.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.640]   "I agree with this.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   I agree with this.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   I agree with this."
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.320]   And this has to happen with the gospel.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.920]   "I agree with this."
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.000]   It is not just like, "Jesus died, rose again, okay.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.920]   I just kind of agree with this general message.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.480]   I agree with the depths of what scripture is saying about the salvation that's presented
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.960]   to us."
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.960]   Even that's not enough.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.680]   In John 3, verse 2, it says, "This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, 'Rabbi,
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.680]   we know that you are a teacher.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.600]   Come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.'"
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.360]   Look, you see knowledge here and you see agreement.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.160]   "Come from God."
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.520]   But that wasn't enough.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:48.280]   It brings us into our third point of belief, trust and depend.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.200]   John 3, verse 16, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son that whoever believes
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.520]   in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.160]   It says, "Whoever believes in Jesus."
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.520]   It's not just believing what he says.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.880]   It's a believing in someone.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.680]   That word there, did I put that down?
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.820]   Oh, yes.
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.800]   That word E-I-S there, or epsilon, or yoda, or sigma, or whatever.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.240]   That right there is this word into.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.240]   Believe into Christ.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.240]   You're believing into someone.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.840]   It's a trust into a person.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.640]   So letter B there is belief must end in trust.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.280]   If you truly believe, you will.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.280]   This is no trick question.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.800]   It's trust again.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.760]   If you believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then you will trust that he has been given
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.480]   the power to save through the power of his life, death, and resurrection.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.240]   You cannot add to the work of Christ.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:44.360]   This is the difference between someone who stands off at the line and someone who draws
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.200]   near to that line and crosses over.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.440]   Here are some words of what it means to trust and depend and to move into this life.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.280]   Some words to help understand trust and dependence.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.160]   First is surrender.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.680]   Luke chapter 14, verse 25 to 33, it says, "Now great crowds accompanied him, and he
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.600]   said to them, 'If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.400]   wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.'"
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.440]   Now what you should be getting is, "Okay, I want to be his disciple."
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.280]   He says, "You cannot be my disciple."
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.520]   What is he saying about me not becoming a disciple?
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.120]   Well, it's to hate all these things, right?
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.160]   Okay, good thing verse 27 and on comes because then you're going to go and hate your family.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.000]   Verse 27, "Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple."
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.920]   He expands on that.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.680]   It's something about taking up a cross.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.680]   Verse 28, "For which of you desiring to build a tower does not first sit down and
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.560]   count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.920]   Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.960]   to mock him, saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'"
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.960]   Ridiculous.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.120]   This guy, like, you know, if you talk to a contractor or someone, like an architect or
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.760]   a builder, an engineer who's saying, like, "We're going to build this thing," and then
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.440]   we say, "Make all these plans," and you start working on it, and at the end you're
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.440]   like, "Oops, sorry."
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.440]   That's ridiculous.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.960]   He's saying, "You have to consider the cost."
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.160]   In verse 31, another one, this is the one we're going to focus on.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.040]   "Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down and first deliberate"
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.040]   – I love that word, deliberate.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.040]   You're like, "Deliberating."
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.040]   It's like if you have a beard, right?
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.040]   You're just deliberating.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:17.480]   "Deliberate, deliberate, whether he is able with 10,000 to meet him who comes against
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.480]   him with 20,000.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.440]   And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440]   terms of peace.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.200]   So, therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple."
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.680]   This is a picture of an army, and you have – how many did it say?
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   10,000 versus 20,000.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.640]   You have an army of 10,000 versus 20,000.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.400]   You might think like, "That's still a lot."
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.480]   You know, you're kind of thinking generally, but this is for real.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.480]   This is a time of war.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.320]   You have 10,000 people, and you look up.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.320]   Think about the movies.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.840]   This giant army is coming, and you're like, "Okay, we're all going to die.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.880]   Like, death is coming at us full speed ahead right now."
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:10:00.760]   And he says, "Which of you, seeing this, isn't going to count the, 'Okay, okay, okay,
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.760]   I see them.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.240]   We're going to die.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.120]   All right, let's surrender.'"
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.440]   Like, who would not do that?
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.800]   He says, "Before, you need to be able to calculate."
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.400]   That word in the Greek is called "lagitsimai."
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   What it means is "consider."
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.080]   You're like deeply considering.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:24.720]   You're calculating a cost.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.960]   So God comes, just like this king, this other nation.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:41.240]   And we're coming before this God, and he's the one asking for peace, right?
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.240]   Yes?
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.840]   God is the one coming to us and asking peace.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.480]   He's stretching it out to us.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.160]   And not like we talked about this in the Revelation series.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.280]   He's not a God who's just like, "Please, please, please."
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:59.280]   No, this is like, "Hey, I have a million to your ten.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.760]   You want peace?"
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.840]   What should be our response?
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.600]   "Yes.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.600]   Right now.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.600]   Please.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600]   I'm yours."
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   Surrender.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.880]   This is to trust and depend on him.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.480]   E there is "submit."
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.480]   Oh, sorry.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.760]   Roman numeral two there.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.760]   "Submit."
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.760]   You can surrender and never submit.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.040]   Someone can totally do that.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.440]   You can surrender, it can be an act, but submission comes in the heart.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.600]   The third one there is "deny."
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.280]   See this Mark chapter 8, verse 34?
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.280]   We saw that.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.280]   "Deny yourself.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.280]   Come to an end of yourself.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.280]   Die to yourself."
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.480]   And this is what it means to trust in God.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.000]   So you need to repent.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.840]   You need to believe.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.360]   Do you want assurance of salvation?
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.800]   Have you done this?
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.800]   Is this you?
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.360]   Is this who you are?
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.200]   This is how you become a believer.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.640]   Letter B there, after the box.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:00.080]   "Your life doesn't need to be perfect and all cleaned up.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.520]   Repentance and belief is found up front where you simply come and plead before God.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.920]   That's it.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.760]   This is why this is a scandalous grace.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.840]   Because there's nothing you need to do but this.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.800]   You do not need to produce all this fruit and say, 'Look how much I've cleaned up my
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.720]   life, my speech, my relationships.'
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:26.800]   Be saying, 'Come as you are, and you drop that before me.'
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.200]   That's it."
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.320]   Luke chapter 18, verse 13, "Be like the tax collector."
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:39.640]   He says, "But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.640]   heaven."
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.640]   I like that.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.640]   The humility, the shame, the, "Ugh."
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:51.240]   He beat his breast saying, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner."
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.400]   That's it.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.800]   You know what it says right after this passage?
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.040]   I forgot to put it in there, but it says, "He was justified."
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.480]   That is, God declared him righteous.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.680]   He is saved.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.640]   Ever and ever and ever into the kingdom of God.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.360]   He will not be able to be snatched out of God's hand.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.800]   "I'm a sinner.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.040]   Be merciful to me.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.040]   I need you."
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.920]   He repented, and he believed.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.920]   And he moved into that.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.680]   It wasn't just a mental thing.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:33.280]   However, it also does mean that how you used to be is different than how you are.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:41.240]   Your life as a wretched sinner and as a saved person needs to look different.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.440]   We'll talk about that a little bit in Roman numeral four.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.320]   Let's go into Roman numeral three here.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.320]   Let's run through this one.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.320]   Is salvation a guarantee?
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.760]   Simple answer, yes, it's a guarantee.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.040]   So four points here.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.800]   First, pursuit of assurance is encouraged.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.040]   Pursuit of assurance is encouraged.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.480]   In Hebrews chapter six verse 11, it says, "And we desire that each one of you show the
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:08.160]   same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end."
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.400]   In 2 Peter chapter one verse 10 through 11, it says, "Therefore, brothers, be all the
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.920]   more diligent to make your calling and election sure.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.960]   For if you practice these qualities, you will never fail."
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.360]   Scripture does tell us, "Pursue it.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   Pursue this assurance."
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.280]   Meaning, it's there for you.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.840]   Assurance is there.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.000]   Secondly, full assurance is given.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.720]   Hebrews chapter 10 verse 21 through 22, it says, "Since we have a great high priest over
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:40.600]   the house of God, let us draw near with a sincere heart and full assurance of faith."
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.960]   Full assurance of faith is given to us.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.000]   Thirdly, full assurance is guaranteed to the end.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.440]   Ephesians chapter one verse 13, "In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.600]   gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.680]   who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it to the praise
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.680]   of his glory."
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   I love that word because it's just guarantee.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.680]   There it is, guarantee.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.720]   Take it to the bank, the deposit.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.240]   Second Timothy chapter one verse 12, "I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.800]   he is able to guard until that day what has been entrusted to me."
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.560]   This guard, this understanding of the century that he is guarding this door.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.840]   And if God is guarding it, he can sleep.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.680]   He can rest assured in this.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.880]   In John, this isn't there, but in John it says that everyone that you have placed into
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:39.640]   my hands, no one will be able to snatch them out of the Father's hands.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.960]   And fourthly, assurance comes from the Spirit.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.360]   The Spirit actually testifies to you this.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:50.240]   The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.960]   Can you become a child of God and then run out of the house?
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.960]   And say, "I'm leaving."
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.960]   No, you can't do that.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.520]   You're a child of God, you are a child of God.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.880]   That's Romans chapter eight verse 16.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.360]   So that is the assurance of salvation.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.360]   It is scriptural.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:08.280]   Bringing us to Roman numeral four, "Then why might I doubt my salvation?"
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.520]   Everyone's doing okay?
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.520]   Yeah?
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.680]   I heard a really big yawn.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:23.160]   Roman numeral four, where are we here?
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.400]   Why might I doubt my salvation?
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.520]   First of all, you are called to examine your faith.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.520]   Those are the lines right there.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.960]   First of all, you are called to examine your faith.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.960]   Why?
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:42.720]   Because in Jeremiah chapter 17 verse nine, it says that the heart is deceitful.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.640]   In second Corinthians chapter 13 verse five, straight up right there, it says, "Test yourself
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.320]   to see if you are in the faith."
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.320]   Examine yourselves.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.320]   That wasn't my talking.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.800]   Look at the scripture, it says it.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.040]   Or do you not recognize this about yourself that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.640]   you fail the test?
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.760]   So doubting salvation is actually part of this, right?
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.760]   You're examining yourself.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.120]   Like, am I really a believer?
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.200]   So doubting in and of itself is not a bad thing.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.180]   It's actually probably a healthy exercise for all of us.
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.560]   We should all be doing it right now.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.120]   I know I did while I was putting this together.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.880]   Letter B, this is the big question that leads to doubting.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.920]   And I think this is why doubts come.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.760]   It's because I'm sinning too much.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.120]   Where's the fruit of salvation?
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.280]   I think that's the main question.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.360]   I think that's why doubts come.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:46.560]   So obviously only a person who thinks that he's Christian doubts his salvation.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.080]   It's sin that gets this ball rolling.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.160]   You begin to think, "This isn't what a Christian should look like."
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.120]   You look at your life and you're kind of examining.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.280]   You question a few things right there in letter A, B, and C.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.960]   You question, "Do I have the Holy Spirit?
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.160]   If I did, can I really be sinning like this?
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.560]   Can I really feel so enslaved like this?"
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.200]   Letter B, if you really believe the gospel, you question that.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.960]   Do I really believe what I'm saying?
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.720]   Because my actions don't really follow through with that.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:20.760]   Letter C, you question, "Do I really love God?"
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:26.000]   All because of sin.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.560]   This produces guilt.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.240]   A human can't stand under the weight of guilt.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.180]   You can't live with guilt.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.760]   You need to do something with it before you move on with your life.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:44.240]   And we're masters at masking, covering, or doing the right things to get over guilt.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.800]   This leads to two extremes.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:56.040]   Now we have to do a really just a boom boom kind of thing with antinomianism versus legalism.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.160]   That's why I printed out that worksheet for you guys.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:05.380]   And by the way, there are certain things in there that on other theological points, like
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:11.700]   one or two things, I'm not completely in line with, but this is a brother and a wise one
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.220]   at that.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:18.280]   So you can go through that worksheet of antinomianism versus legalism and kind of see a little bit
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.780]   deeper why doubting salvation will lead to these extremes.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.780]   But let's go through a little bit.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:31.200]   The first way you can, and usually these are two extremes, but usually most of us are swinging
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.960]   back and forth between the two.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.520]   Antinomianism basically means free grace, driven by carnality.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.000]   Literally it means anti-law.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.380]   And people tend to find an answer for their sin and guilt through this.
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:51.600]   They say grace is free and there is nothing needed on our part other than a declaration
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.780]   of the saving work of Christ.
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.920]   An antinomian will then say faith is all you need in your life.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.920]   God's forgiveness is that great.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.520]   Do I have Romans 6?
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.640]   Can you go to the next slide real quick?
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.800]   Nope, I didn't have it, sorry.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.920]   Okay, Romans 6, verse 1 talks about this, that God's forgiveness is that great.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.800]   But let it be there.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:26.000]   This statement will appease your guilt in a bad way, in a negative way.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.680]   It's like trying to mask your guilt by saying, "Well, God is gracious.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.240]   Well, God forgives, he loves.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.040]   I repented and I believe."
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.120]   Letters C, here's the problem.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.360]   James 2, verse 17 flies in the face of this.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.440]   Faith without works is dead.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.040]   If there is no evidence of faith, then the reality is there is no faith.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:55.240]   We call this fruit.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:00.360]   Yes, faith and belief is all you need.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:06.080]   But if you're not producing fruit, then you don't actually have that faith and belief.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.680]   We all know the example of a fruit tree, right?
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.640]   You have a fruit tree and then I guess it's an apple tree, then you expect it to bear
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.640]   an apple.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.640]   But if it's not bearing an apple, guess what?
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.640]   It's not an apple tree.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.960]   It's probably an orange tree or something.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.800]   It needs to bear fruit.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:33.040]   Martin Luther says, "We are justified by faith alone, but not by faith that is alone."
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:39.000]   One way to kind of think through it is, you know, we like to think it's justification
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   plus...
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Oh, actually, never mind.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   We'll get to this one later.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.560]   Let's go to John 15, verse 1-10.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.240]   It says, "I am the true vine and my father is the vinedresser.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.800]   Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away."
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.800]   Listen to this.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.120]   "And every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.120]   Already you are clean."
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.200]   So in verse 2, you're kind of thinking this.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.600]   Okay, if you're bearing fruit, he'll prune that will bear more fruit.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.400]   If you're not bearing fruit, he says he'll take it away.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.760]   Big question, what does it mean to be taken away?
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.600]   Is it like he's going to discipline us or what's he going to do with us?
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.640]   And that's a big question.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.840]   Verse 3, "Already you are clean because of the word that I've spoken to you.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.080]   Abide in me and I in you.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.040]   As a branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine."
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   There's another thing.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.420]   It's evidence of the fact that you're in the vine.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.840]   If you are in the vine, it's almost like you can't help it.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.840]   Fruit is born.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.840]   Right?
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.800]   But if it's not bearing fruit, that means you're not in the vine.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.000]   This is very logical stuff.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.760]   Verse 5, "I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.640]   Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.720]   For apart from me, you can do nothing.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.440]   If anyone does not abide in me," here it is, okay, here's what happens to the branches,
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.760]   "he is thrown away like a branch and withers."
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.320]   Oh, I die, sad.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.240]   "And the branches are gathered and thrown into the fire and burned."
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.240]   Uh-oh.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.920]   Verse 7, "If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish and it
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.920]   will be done for you.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.000]   By this my Father is glorified that you bear much fruit and so you prove to be my disciples."
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.160]   Meaning if you're not bearing fruit, it's proof that you are not his disciples.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.120]   "As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.120]   Abide in my love.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.040]   If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love just as I have kept my Father's
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.440]   commandments and abide in his love."
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.320]   Commandments, law.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   Antinomianism is anti-law.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.440]   Just grace, give me grace.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.920]   Forget the law, it doesn't matter anymore.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.720]   If you love him, commands, you will follow them.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:31.600]   So it sure seems like you need to do things as a result, as a result of salvation, not
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.600]   for salvation.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.320]   Big, big difference there.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.320]   So how do you counter this?
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.240]   Chapter F, what do I do when I see traces of sin in my life?
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.440]   Well then you are called, if you don't want to be driven by this carnality, by this living
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.760]   of free grace, it's pursue holiness.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.520]   See a holy God and the ugliness of sin.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.820]   Number two there, what is the freedom?
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.000]   What is freedom in Christ?
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.080]   It's not freedom to do whatever I want, it's freedom to follow God.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.200]   That's what's always being talked about.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.400]   In Titus chapter 2 verse 11 to 12 it says, "For the grace of God has appeared bringing
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.680]   salvation for all mankind."
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.320]   The grace of God has appeared, there it is, grace.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.200]   So if you're anti-Gnome-ing you're like, "Grace!"
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.720]   And it says, "It trains us to renounce ungodliness."
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   It says, "It trains us to say no to the things of the world."
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.120]   Then Romans chapter 6 verse 12 to 14 it says, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.640]   body to make you obey its passions.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.820]   Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.360]   to God as those who have been brought from death to life and your members to God as instruments
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.360]   for righteousness.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:38.280]   For sin will have no dominion over you since you are not under law but under grace."
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.880]   So we would agree with that last part, right?
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.680]   Verse 14, "Not under law but under grace."
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.640]   Great, but what is it talking about?
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.920]   It's saying then, "Don't let sin reign in you."
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.520]   Something, it needs to look like something.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:56.880]   Sin cannot reign.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:03.880]   In that counter, that was Romans chapter 6 verse 12 to 14.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.240]   Let's go to number two, legalism, work salvation.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.240]   This is driven by guilt.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.240]   This is the other extreme.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.440]   When you doubt your salvation you might start to become more legalistic.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.280]   It means you do more things.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.360]   Letter A, people tend to this to find an answer for their sin and guilt.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.320]   Just like with antinomianism, right?
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.320]   You work harder.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:24.860]   So it's not just a quick fix, but it's like, "Okay, I've got to do more."
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:32.920]   Letter B, "I need to come cleaned up and holy before I can receive true salvation."
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.720]   Letter C there, "The conscience speaks against forgiveness.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:44.480]   Conscience knows only guilt and conviction but nothing of grace and mercy."
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.480]   That's what guilt is, right?
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.480]   It comes from conscience.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.160]   And this conscience says nothing about forgiveness.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.240]   And so I've got to do something about this.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.760]   So instead of turning to the right place of forgiveness and grace and mercy, it goes to
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.500]   this, "Okay, how do I achieve this for myself?
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.360]   How do I live up to this standard?"
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.240]   So the counter, "What do I do when I see traces of sin in my life?
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.760]   And when the temptation is to work harder, what must I do?"
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:19.280]   Here's what Colossians chapter 2 verse 16 to 23 says, "Therefore, let no one pass judgment
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.320]   on you in questions of food and drink."
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.120]   By the way, right before this it talks about Christ and what he did for us, that he saved
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.840]   us and that he freed us from the law of God and all the legal demands.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   He nailed it on the cross.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.160]   It's crucified and it's gone.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.000]   And he says, "Therefore, let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink or with
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.600]   regard to a festival or a new moon or Sabbath.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.500]   These are a shadow of the things to come but the substance belongs to Christ.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.720]   Let no one disqualify you insisting on asceticism and worship of angels going on in detail about
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:51.040]   visions puffed up without reason by a sensuous mind and not holding fast to, I'll just say,
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.040]   the law."
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.120]   Verse 20, "If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as if you were
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.640]   still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations?
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   Do not handle."
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:05.120]   So basically, don't do this, do this, do this, don't do this.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.920]   Verse 23, "These have indeed an appearance of wisdom and promoting self-made religion."
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.840]   Yikes.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.960]   Self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body but they are of no value in stopping
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.360]   indulgence of the flesh.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.880]   We see some kind of sin in our life and we're like, "Oh, this is not good."
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.520]   So we become legalistic and we're trying to do more things.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:30.400]   So like a common used example, something like pornography, if you're struggling in pornography,
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.960]   "I got to just not do that."
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:36.760]   And you try so hard and we do different things and we put different filters and we do all
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.880]   these things that says that they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:46.440]   because you're trying to address something where another thing is supposed to be addressed
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.240]   here.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.640]   So the temptation is to work harder, what must I do?
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:58.280]   But what we should be doing, here's the next part, is take a harder look at grace.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:04.400]   Take a harder look at grace.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.320]   And I know Kazeeha got this from somewhere, I can't remember, but she tells this to me
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.440]   all the time because I beat myself up all the time over my sin.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.000]   I'm like that kind of guy.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.320]   It says, "For every look at my sin-stained heart, look 10 times at the cross.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:23.060]   If you have repented and believed in Christ, every time you look at your sin-stained heart,
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.920]   you just keep going back to the cross.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.280]   Keep going back to the cross.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.680]   Keep going back to the cross.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.080]   Keep remembering what He did for you, that while you were still sinners, not just in
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.240]   the past, but forever and ever, every sin, everything has been justified.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.520]   As far as the east from the west, your sin is taken away from you.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.520]   You are cleaned.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.400]   You are made white as snow.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.820]   All these things, this is the truth for you.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.960]   Remember what has been done for you.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:52.320]   And then the result then becomes desire to work harder against sin.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.600]   That's fruit.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.960]   It's not that you're trying to fight sin because this is sheer willpower.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.080]   It's that you see the cross, you see what God has done, and constantly you're revisiting
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   this.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.720]   Sin is good in the sense that it constantly brings you back to the cross.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:14.600]   And every time you see it, and you just break over it again, you repent all over again,
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:23.400]   "Please, I need you today just as much as I needed you when I first became a believer."
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.880]   And then the desire to work harder against sin happens.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:33.320]   And it's no longer a work in the sense of legalism, but a work in the sense of joy.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.320]   And this will be a cyclical thing.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.560]   You're going to be repenting forever, or for this life.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.640]   But either grace is free, there is no more work to be done for salvation.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.640]   Remember that.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.640]   All right.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.800]   We're almost there now.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   Roman numeral five.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.960]   What happens as a result of salvation?
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   Letter A. Wow, look at that long passage.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.320]   That's the text I put there.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.600]   But it's so good.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.720]   So increasing understanding of grace.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.840]   We must understand the grace that saved us continues to grace us.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.840]   Charles Spurgeon.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.720]   This guy is the man.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.440]   I'm going to go and talk to this guy when I get to heaven.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:19.400]   He says, "Whenever I feel that I have sinned and desire to overcome that sin for the future,
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.800]   the devil at the same time comes to me and whispers, 'How can you be a pardoned person?'"
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.800]   I don't know why I started doing that.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.800]   "Accept it with God while you sin in this way.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.520]   If I listen to this, I drop into despondency.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.280]   And if I continue in that state, I should fall into despair and should commit sin more
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.720]   frequently than before."
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.960]   Have you guys sensed that before?
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.000]   You despair and you just fall right back into it.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.640]   And you feel like, "What is going on?"
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.040]   That's the enslavement feeling you have because of what you feel.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:50.200]   "But God's grace comes in and says to my soul, 'Thou has sinned but did not.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.440]   Jesus comes to save sinners.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.640]   Thou art not saved because thou art righteous.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.560]   For Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.600]   And my faith says, 'Though I have sinned, I have not advocated with the Father, Jesus
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.600]   Christ, the righteous.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.280]   And though I am guilty, yet by grace I am saved.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.320]   And I am a child of God still.'"
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.440]   What then?
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.640]   Why then the tears begin to flow and I say, "How could I ever sin against my God who is
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.800]   so good to me?
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.040]   Now I will overcome that sin and I get strong to fight with sin through conviction that
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.520]   I am God's child."
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.120]   This is so cool.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:26.560]   So increasing understanding of grace, that happens as a result of salvation.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.520]   Better be transformation of the previous life.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.640]   It's an entire renewal of man.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.880]   Second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 states that, "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.880]   creature.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.880]   The old things passed away.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.920]   Behold, new things have come.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.520]   You are set free.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.520]   The truth will set you free."
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.080]   It says that in John chapter 8 verse 31 through 36.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.800]   It says that Christ's burden is light.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.400]   And this is not talking about just trials of life.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.240]   This is talking specifically, most specifically about this burden that they feel over their
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.960]   sin in Matthew 11, 28 through 30.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.880]   Side note, reminder that context is very important.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.880]   Don't use that just anywhere.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.160]   Matthew 11, 28 through 30, "My burden is light.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.160]   My yoke is easy."
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.360]   We are completely transformed.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:13.240]   The reality and the reminder of our identity, that that is who we are, is very, very important.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.240]   Letter C, what's another result?
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   You kill sin.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.360]   You kill sin.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.560]   Here's a practical reminder, practical application.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.960]   Try starting by killing off one major sin in your life.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:31.560]   Sometimes you get so like, you see all the sin in your life and you just like, "Oh,
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:37.440]   I give up.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.520]   Forget this.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.000]   I'll just play the part."
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.800]   Or it becomes like, "I'll deal with it later when finals are done."
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.840]   Just start by killing off a major sin and you'd be surprised.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:57.040]   It really gets you into this mentality of like, "Oh, dude, this feels good fighting
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.040]   sin.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.440]   This is like who I am.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.600]   This is what I love because I love God."
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:06.000]   As you're fighting this one major sin, a lot of things start to trickle effect in.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.280]   So if you're overwhelmed by sin, just tackle one major sin and say, "I'm going to kill
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.280]   it."
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.280]   Notice the word "kill."
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.440]   Don't just like, it's not like, you know, when we're in front of an in and out burger
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.440]   and, "I'm going to kill this."
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.440]   It's not like that kind of kill.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.320]   It's like, "Kill it.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.320]   Kill this thing.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.320]   Uproot it.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.320]   Make sure none of it exists.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.320]   Obliterate it.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.320]   There's nothing left."
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:32.240]   If you're an alcoholic, you're like, you're, it's not just that you hide it back.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:36.640]   You know, "I'm going to hide one wine bottle in the back of the cabinet just in case like
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.640]   company comes over."
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.280]   It's like you get everything and then you go, not even outside to your trash can because
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.080]   you know you might go back to the trash can.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.280]   You go to the town dump and you dig a hole and you throw everything in there and you
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.360]   bury it and you say, "Get out of my life."
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.360]   And that's what you do with sin.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.360]   You kill it.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.360]   Number two, go on the offensive.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.120]   This is what it says in Romans chapter 12 verse 14, "Bless those who persecute you.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.120]   Bless and do not curse them."
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.200]   And okay, and the reason why I'm using this, you're like, "What is this all about?"
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:07.360]   It's because God actually talks a lot about going on the offensive as Christians.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.120]   That it's not, if someone's persecuting you, you would think the best thing to do is to
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:14.400]   like avoid them, ignore them, or just like shut your mouth.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.000]   You know, like, "I'm not going to say anything back to you and that's going to be my grace
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   on you."
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.360]   No, no, no, don't just not take it but like go out and bless them.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.320]   Do the opposite effect.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.160]   You know, some of you guys might say, "I have anger issues with my dad.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.720]   I have anger issues with my mom.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.720]   This is really hard.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.180]   My sister, annoying to death."
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:38.040]   And you say like, "I'm going to try not to be angry anymore.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.560]   That's my conviction.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.560]   That's my application."
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.000]   But God's call is not for you to just be defensive like that.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.120]   I'm not going to get angry, but to go on the offensive and say, "I am going to love.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.880]   I am going to serve."
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.440]   Number three, they're kill the enemy.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.440]   We did this again.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.440]   That's okay.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.440]   Here are some five sub points.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.280]   Don't sugarcoat sin in your life.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.700]   Don't sugarcoat sin in your life.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.580]   Sugar tastes good, right?
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:10.480]   Don't wrap that like sugar stuff around sin and say like, "It's not that bad."
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.280]   It's killing you, so kill it.
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.920]   Letter B, be consistent in dealing with sin.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.920]   Consistency is big.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.400]   You don't have a conviction because you came to praise and prayer night last night.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.960]   That conviction needs to be here today.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:25.160]   Your killing of sin, if you thought about that last night, needs to continue tomorrow.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.520]   And don't just think after a Sunday sermon, "Oh, conviction.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.520]   Yes, let's go.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.520]   Pastor Peter is amazing.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.520]   Let's go do this."
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.440]   And then Monday, you're like, "Oh, all right.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.080]   Well, trying to remember why I felt that way."
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.080]   Be consistent in dealing with sin.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.360]   Letter C, use the word, that's the word of God, to poison sin.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.120]   That means you can never be apart from the word of God because the word of God is going
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.360]   to be the consistent truth and foundation in your life that will never shake.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.560]   It's going to constantly...
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.520]   It's like that friend who's really blunt, who constantly tells you what you need to
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.280]   hear but you don't really like it, but you know you need it and it's good and you realize
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.360]   that's a good friend.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:03.800]   The word of God, and then use it to poison your sin and say, "Oh, sin that looks so attractive,
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.520]   the word of God reveals it for what it is.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.320]   It's like, "Whoa, get this thing away from me.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.880]   I did not like that."
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.120]   Letter D, use prayer to expose your hidden sins.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.320]   Pray, get down and say, "God, expose me my sins."
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.600]   We see this in the Psalms a lot.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.800]   Use prayer to expose your hidden sins.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.840]   God, even the things that I can't see, there are a lot of us who are here who have grown
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:27.520]   so jaded and apathetic and we think like, "Man, I feel like I need to force myself to
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.320]   feel the conviction and weight of sin.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.080]   I know this is wrong but it doesn't feel that bad anymore."
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.000]   Well, use prayer to expose them because even though you see it as sin, it might be hidden
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.400]   to you right now.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.240]   Letter E, relentlessly move forward.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:48.200]   That means guns blazing like that horse, you know when the gates open and not NASCAR.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.960]   What do you call horses when they run?
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.240]   Horse races.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:56.960]   When the gates open and they're just running, it's just boom, like a bullet out.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:02.080]   You're just relentlessly just going, going, going, going forward, forward, forward, forward,
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.560]   truck through like this.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.960]   I think we need to become a generation that's a generation of more conviction.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:15.400]   It says we hate it to the point where we're like, "We're going to take this to the end."
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.800]   We hate sin that much.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.880]   Letter D, pursue growth.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:24.600]   That means don't just sit back and coast but push yourself to grow.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.640]   Letter B there is cultivate fruit.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:34.040]   In Galatians chapter 5 verse 16 through 18, you might memorize the fruit of the spirit
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.160]   but I remember this part, "But I say walk by the spirit and you will not gratify the
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.160]   desires of the flesh.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.800]   For the desires of the flesh are against the spirit and the desires of the spirit are against
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   the flesh.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.600]   For these are opposed to each other to keep you from doing the things you want to do.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.760]   But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law."
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.840]   It talks about what the fruit of the spirit is, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.840]   goodness, faithfulness, justice, self-control.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.960]   When you look at these things in your life, you have to cultivate it.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.840]   That means don't think like, "Oh, here are nine things, let's cultivate it."
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.800]   It's like you go into each thing and think, "How can I cultivate this type of fruit in
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   my life?"
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.360]   Love, camp there.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.080]   Joy, camp there.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.280]   Self-control, camp there.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.800]   Think about it, cultivate it.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:15.000]   No farmer is going to go out there and be like, "I'm just going to throw a bucket of
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.160]   water here and hope things grow."
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.320]   It's like you got to go and then, okay, this one, my dad was a landscaper.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.980]   That's why I like agricultural things.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:25.720]   But like every time, he went back to Russia on Tuesday and then every time like I got
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.120]   to think about plants again because our whole backyard is covered with plants.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.920]   So every plant, he's like, "This one, you got to water every two days.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.600]   This one, make sure you don't water it every two days or it will die.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:35.640]   Water it once a week.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.160]   This one over there, do not touch it or I will kill you."
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.880]   My dad said that.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.960]   And these kinds of things, you realize you got to cultivate fruit and so do that as a
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   believer.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:50.240]   And these things, all these things are going to work to help you in your assurance of salvation.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.480]   Let her see there, this hard work is part of faith.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.440]   Sometimes we think that effort proves that it's not real, but a lot of times, effort
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.840]   is what proves that our faith is real.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.840]   Don't get that mixed up because I think there are times where we feel like if I have to
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.680]   force myself, then it must not come from a genuine heart, right?
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.120]   Millennials, you know, like it needs to be genuine.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.520]   It needs to be authentic for it to like real.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.520]   It can't be forced.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.580]   It can't be shaped.
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.680]   And so if it feels like that, then it's not real so I might as well not do it.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.920]   Well, it's not like that.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:23.000]   Actually, in the effort, in the work, it does show a great faith and it shows a great love
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   for God.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.120]   Let her see there, faith is tested through your hardship.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.560]   John Newton says there, "We cannot be safely trusted with assurance till we have that knowledge
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.240]   of the evil and deceitfulness of our hearts, which can be acquired only by painful, repeated
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.240]   experience."
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:42.600]   And so there will be hardships, both external and internal, that will come in our lives.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:47.200]   Just a few verses to note here, Matthew 26, verse 34-35.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.240]   Remember Peter?
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:53.440]   The one who just a moment ago cut off a priest's ear saying, "Gung ho, Jesus.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.280]   I'm going to die for you.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.160]   I'm not going to let these guys take you."
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.680]   And then this little girl, a little bit later, the little girl says, "Hey, don't you know
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.680]   Jesus?"
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.560]   He's like, "No."
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:09.240]   And so these things are going to come into your life that test your faith.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.240]   James chapter 1, verse 2-4.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.840]   It says, "Count it all, join my brothers when you meet trials of various kinds, for you
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.320]   know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.520]   And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.520]   in nothing."
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:26.880]   So the word perfect and complete, there's an element of maturity, growth, completion
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.920]   of who you are as a believer.
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.840]   And that happens through trials.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.920]   And even through trials of your own sin, fighting your own sin.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.920]   That is a trial.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.240]   Hebrews chapter 12, verse 3-7.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.720]   "And God will discipline us."
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.240]   This is another type of hardship, right?
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.080]   God will discipline us to grow in faith.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:50.840]   Okay, you guys can read that on your own some other time.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.120]   Here's some diagnostic questions.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:41:01.440]   Roman numeral six.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.440]   And ask this of yourself.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.680]   When did you realize that you were a sinner?
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.880]   Oh, by the way, these five came directly from Pastor Mark.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.280]   I think, Pastor Mark, these are great questions.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:16.240]   Pastor Mark, I heard that when he counsels you guys, all he does is ask you questions
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.400]   and it drives you crazy, but you realize how amazing it is.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.480]   Like, when did you realize that you were a sinner?
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:27.360]   This is like, oh, oh man.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:31.600]   Have you even had a point where you realized you were a sinner?
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.640]   For real?
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:39.720]   Not just that you have to force yourself to believe in a theological concept of human
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:45.800]   depravity, but like, that's me.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   You feel it.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   I'm a sinner.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.120]   Question number three, when and how did you repent and ask God to forgive you?
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.280]   Did you move into that repenting and believing type of thing?
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.840]   God, that is me.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.320]   I need you in this.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.320]   Letter C, when did you trust in Jesus' sacrifice?
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.080]   Now, you could get to the point where you say, like, I need you, I need you, I need
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.080]   you, but if you sit there, remember, we went through that list.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.240]   If you sit there, that's not gonna be enough.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.760]   That's not gonna get you anywhere in your salvation.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.080]   You'll still go to hell believing that.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.640]   You need to trust in Christ's sacrifice and that it's done.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:20.880]   It's complete, holy, completely finished for you.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.600]   Letter D there, when did you feel his repentance?
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   This repentance?
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.600]   Huh?
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.600]   His forgiveness.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.600]   Oh, I took it as this repentance.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:38.040]   Okay, cool.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.760]   When did you feel his forgiveness?
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:47.480]   So you're sitting there, and good thing you're here.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.120]   Not only that you repent, but have you ever, like, repented at a brick wall?
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.160]   Or like you repented and then, like, that person was like, okay.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.160]   And that's it.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.120]   And you're like, all right, thank you for saying that.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   And then they leave and you're like, oh.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.520]   You know, like, oh, no.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.520]   This is not okay.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.120]   Well, that he actually forgave you.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:17.120]   He looks at you and says, I forgive you.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.120]   And take him at his word.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.120]   His belief.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.000]   And letter E, how have you been changing?
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.200]   This has to result.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:31.160]   If you do, if you have fully comprehended this, and maybe I shouldn't say fully comprehended.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:37.120]   If you've really attained this, then you will change.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:45.360]   Because this kind of meeting up with a God like this, there is no way you can leave unchanged.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.980]   (Session concluded at 4pm)
