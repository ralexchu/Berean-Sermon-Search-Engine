[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   I'm gonna do a little quick review.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.200]   A-M-D-R-J.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.600]   You guys know what that is, right?
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.600]   I am Dr. Jesus.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.200]   2,500, 1,500.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:22.040]   And then that T-J in the middle, what is that?
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.780]   Tribes and judges.
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:35.680]   And then if you look at the blue, king split, and then the A-B-C-D, Medo-Persians, return,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.200]   return, return, Greeks and Jesus.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.460]   You guys following along on the letters on the top?
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:50.480]   And that E-A in the middle, you guys know that it's the war, Elijah, Elisha, and then
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.120]   the Assyria.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.120]   And you know that that...
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.120]   What's the five R's?
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:06.920]   Rest, relapse, ruin, restoration, repentance, restoration, and rest, again and again.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:18.680]   And remember, judges, 400 years, 21 chapters, Joshua, in contrast, 10 years, 24 chapters,
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.680]   six chapters, 24 chapters.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.560]   And you guys know what R-E is?
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.080]   Who is that?
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.520]   Rehoboam.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.720]   And if you guys did the kings in order, Rehoboam's Appa is G-G.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.720]   Okay?
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:53.920]   Rehoboam, Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Jehoram.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.840]   And then you have Re-Ah.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:11.560]   So Ahaziah, lashes, Queen Athaliah, Jehosh, amazing Uzis, Amaziah, Uziah, Jojo, Jojo,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.080]   Jotham, Haz, a manly arm, right?
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:31.640]   Jotham, Ahaziah, no Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, and then Amun.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.920]   And then who's King 16?
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.440]   Josiah.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.440]   So you guys are following along.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.760]   And that's gonna make a lot of sense when you read some of the prophets, okay?
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.800]   So you have Rehoboam, six is Ahaziah, and we're still in the divided kingdom.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.520]   And then you have Jotham.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.200]   And what happens in about 18 years from Jotham?
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.480]   722 is what?
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.200]   Assyria wipes out Israel.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.480]   And the last Jo we're gonna look at today, Josiah 640.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.960]   Six forty is about 28 years from what being shelved?
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.400]   Assyria being shelved, okay?
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.160]   And then you end up with just one kingdom, and then Judah's gone as well.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.440]   And then we learned the main kings of the north that we need to remember are Jeroboam,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:36.320]   Baasha, Omri, Ahab is a big one, and then Jeroboam again.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.800]   And then H is Hoshea, and he's the last one before Sennacherib comes and wipes out the
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   north.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.800]   Okay?
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.800]   The BCD poem.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:04:02.840]   612, Assyria's shelved, Judah soon to follow, 586, temples nixed, Jeremiah laments and wallows.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.200]   So you guys kind of have the 722 there, 612, what happens 612?
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.520]   Assyria's gone.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.320]   What happens in 586?
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.920]   The temple's gone, and then Judah's gone.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.520]   Okay?
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.920]   And we looked at, so the BCD poem, and what are the four books, well the six books, including
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.400]   Jeremiah and Lamentations, that are involved in this period, the BCD?
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.400]   Heads, right?
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:45.720]   Abak, Hakuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Z is Zephaniah.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.680]   So Bak and Phan, that's how you can distinguish which H and Z they are.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.560]   And then the Weyhah Jamin, just as a review, what are the books of the Old Testament that
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.080]   kind of coincide with that Weyhah?
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:11.160]   Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.440]   And we didn't do the pictures for those yet, right?
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:21.760]   So we're gonna wrap up books 33 to 39 today of the Old Testament.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.680]   Okay?
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.280]   So this is Micah, we're gonna just get these out of the way.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.960]   If you guys have your Bibles, I'm gonna do a little bit of an exercise with you, okay?
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.200]   Turn to Micah chapter 1, verse 1.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.800]   In the past, you might have just read it and just glossed over it, okay?
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.280]   But now look at Micah 1.1.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.960]   Micah 1.1.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.600]   If you guys have your Bibles, Micah 1.1.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:03.240]   Okay, I'm gonna read slowly, okay?
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:14.040]   The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.280]   Hezekiah.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.120]   If you had a piece of paper and you started writing out like what goes where, now you
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.280]   can kind of place this, right?
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.000]   And where is Micah?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.320]   We are Jamin, right?
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.880]   So you can kind of place that there.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.400]   Kings of Judah.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.120]   But during this time, is Samaria still around?
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.000]   Yes.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.400]   So kings of Judah, and which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.440]   What is Samaria?
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.800]   Capital of the north.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.520]   And what's Jerusalem?
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.120]   Capital of the south.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.920]   Now you can read, 'cause a lot of the prophets actually date themselves.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.280]   So you can kind of figure out what historical context they fit under, okay?
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.080]   So if you look at the picture, you see a mic.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.720]   That's how you remember Micah.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.760]   And that sun that's there with sunglasses, that sun, so people don't think it's like
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.200]   fire, represents day, okay?
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.680]   So the next few pictures, you're gonna actually see the sun a couple times.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:30.160]   Day, so the day in court, all right?
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.920]   But on the title, I put Judah's day in court.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.520]   But if you look at Micah 1.1, what does it say?
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.160]   The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.840]   kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.680]   That's what you see, right?
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.520]   So why am I saying Judah's day in court?
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:58.840]   Because God starts out in Micah bashing Samaria.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:07.960]   So if God says this, what kingdom is gonna be excited about Samaria getting judged?
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.240]   The south, okay?
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.040]   So they're excited.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.640]   But God comes and says, "Jerusalem, you are even worse.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.280]   And the only thing that's protecting you is my grace and my covenant to David."
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:31.240]   So though Samaria, the book starts out about Samaria, Micah goes into mostly Judah.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.760]   And even there, Micah 5.2, he talks about, "Oh, out of you, Bethlehem, Ephrathah, there's
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.920]   gonna be a savior that's gonna come."
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.320]   Who's born in Bethlehem?
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.100]   Jesus.
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.840]   So all of these prophecies do point to Christ.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.400]   But the book of Micah, think of a day in court, but whose day in court?
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.400]   Judah.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.880]   They're gonna be judged, okay?
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:02.000]   So Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, but because I shared with you last week, Hezekiah, because of Hezekiah,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.660]   Assyria couldn't conquer the south, okay?
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.280]   So that's Micah.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:16.700]   And then for Nahum, there's a flood there, okay?
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.720]   And just think of a flooded Nahum.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:27.600]   And Nahum is talking about Nineveh's destruction by flood.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.560]   So what two books are about Assyria?
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.760]   We jam in J and N, but what's the J?
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.760]   Jonah.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.080]   And then what happens to Assyria in the book of Jonah?
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.080]   They repent.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.740]   They look like these great people who are very humble.
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.760]   But if you know the historical context, that's not the case.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:52.040]   But what happens in Nahum, 120 years later, there's a prophecy of their destruction.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.960]   But the thing with Nineveh is they had very high walls and they were surrounded by these
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.600]   waters.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.120]   But historically, the waters actually just, it just started flooding.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:08.540]   So the Babylonians came and wiped them out because the Assyrians were too busy dealing
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.540]   with the flood.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.920]   And then the wall was not as high when the waters have risen, right?
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.920]   So with an overflowing flood, I will make an end of Nineveh, it actually says, I think,
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.520]   Nahum chapter three, verse one.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.400]   Okay, so there is a prophecy of destruction by flood, which comes true historically.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:31.360]   And this city was buried and wiped out until archaeologists covered it up a few decades
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.720]   ago.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.120]   So what's Micah about?
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.360]   Judah's day in court, okay?
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   They're going to be judged.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:45.280]   Nahum, the flood and their destruction.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:52.520]   And remember, historical context, we are Jaman, or Elijah, Elisha, Assyria, and then the books
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:11:03.280]   that coincide with that, Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, and Nahum, okay?
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.280]   And we're almost done with all the Old Testament books in terms of the pictures.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.880]   Here's a backpack, ha backpack.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.040]   Okay, that's how you remember the picture.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:21.240]   So this guy wearing a ha backpack, what's he standing on top of?
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.000]   A big tower of watches, all right?
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.820]   So just think of like a watch tower.
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.080]   And what is he seeing?
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.680]   Babylon is coming.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.520]   That's what he sees.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:41.240]   So he's complaining because Assyria's bad, even Judah's bad.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.980]   He's like, God, your people, there's so much injustice.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.960]   There's so much corruption.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.040]   How long, oh Lord, must I cry for help?
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.040]   And you will not hear, I cry out to you violence and you don't save.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.480]   Why do you make me see destruction?
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.080]   Why do you cause me to look at iniquity?
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.080]   That's verse three.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.640]   Verse four, he says, therefore the law is paralyzed and justice comes up, is never upheld
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.840]   for the wicked surround the righteous and justice comes out perverted.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.240]   So Habakkuk is complaining to God.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.320]   And in chapter one, verse six, God says to Habakkuk, I'm going to raise up the Chaldeans,
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.940]   the Babylonians, and they're going to come and they're even worse.
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:23.620]   So Habakkuk is like, huh, but then God says, but the righteous will live by faith.
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.560]   So that's where, you know, the righteous shall live by faith.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.400]   Is that a very important verse?
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.420]   Yeah, but in historical context, it comes out of Habakkuk.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.660]   Bad goes to worse, but the righteous shall live by faith.
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.860]   And that is even applicable today.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:46.640]   Christianity is becoming more and more of a scoff worthy religious paradigm.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.280]   Is it not?
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:55.560]   But you who believe in Christ's perfect life, death, and resurrection, you who have come
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:01.960]   to embrace the gospel as the only way of being restored to God, the creator, you live by
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.360]   faith, okay?
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.520]   Regardless of what the surrounding situations dictate.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.800]   So Habakkuk is about transitions and watchtowers.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:20.040]   And then we have a few more, but I'm just going to do one more for now.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.640]   Zeefanaya.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.640]   Zeefanaya.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:31.840]   Okay, he's fanning himself, he's not fanning himself because it's hot.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.520]   It's just to, so you can remember the picture.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   Zeefan.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.520]   And what's that in the background?
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.520]   The sun.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.680]   What does the sun stand for?
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.000]   The day.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.820]   So the day of the Lord is coming.
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.320]   So I'm going to read for you verse one of, if you have your Bibles, turn to Zeefanaya
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.320]   1.1.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.800]   So you can kind of see what's going on.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:14:01.120]   Okay, Zeefanaya 1.1.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:08.400]   The word of the Lord that came to Zeefanaya, the son of Kishai, son of Gedaliah, son of
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.280]   Amariah, son of Hezekiah.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.520]   Is Hezekiah a familiar name?
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:24.900]   In the days of Josiah, the son of Ammon, king of Judah.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.080]   What number is Ammon?
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.440]   15.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.440]   And what's the other Joe?
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.160]   Sia.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.760]   Okay we're studying 16.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.920]   So this is happening toward the latter part.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.960]   So in that Hezekiah is probably the king.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.600]   So Zeefanaya is a prophet, but who is his great grandfather?
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.160]   King.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.760]   So he's royalty and he's prophesying the word of the Lord.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:05.160]   And what he's prophesying in Zeefanaya is the day of the Lord is going to come and two
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.840]   things are going to happen.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:13.380]   The wicked are going to be judged and the righteous are going to be saved.
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.760]   So what happens when the day of the Lord comes?
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.880]   The wicked are going to be judged, especially Judah.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.420]   And the righteous are going to be saved, including the nations.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.400]   So that's the message of Zeefanaya.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:34.760]   The day of the Lord is coming, chapter two, the wicked will be judged, starting with Judah.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.600]   And what is Judah?
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.160]   His chosen line, right?
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.860]   So they're going to be judged and God calls Judah wicked.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.360]   But the righteous will be saved, including all the nations.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.320]   So chapter three talks about the nations.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:55.280]   So for the Jews, they should have picked up on this in the time of Christ.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.760]   So what is Micah about?
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.800]   The day in court, Judah's day in court.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   Nahum.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.760]   A flooded Nahum, what's Nahum about?
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.760]   Destruction in Nineveh?
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.920]   I'll try to remember.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.680]   What's Habakkuk about?
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.560]   Watchtowers and transitions, okay?
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.580]   And then Zeefanaya, the day of the Lord.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.440]   And what happens at the day of the Lord?
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.840]   Logically, the righteous will be judged and the wicked will be saved.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.280]   Ah, you guys are paying attention.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.320]   The wicked will be judged, including who?
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.320]   Judah.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.480]   Why doesn't he say Israel?
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.800]   Because Israel's gone, okay?
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.480]   And then the righteous will be saved and that includes all nations who believe in the Lord.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.240]   All right?
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:57.480]   So as a quick review, we see Genesis through Deuteronomy there.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.960]   And then on the right, Joshua judges Ruth.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.240]   One Samuel, two Samuel, one Kings.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.760]   These are all historical books.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.000]   Second Kings, what's Second Kings about, you guys?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.240]   Two kings are sitting there on an isolated thing.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.240]   What's going on?
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.880]   There's division, okay?
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.720]   One Chronicle, what's one Chronicle about?
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.920]   David, what's two Chronicles about?
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.920]   The line of Judah.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.560]   And then Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther we covered last week.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.120]   Ezra's about the rebuilding of the temple, which we're going to talk about today.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:35.680]   Nehemiah is about the wall, which is about surrounding Jerusalem.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.600]   And Esther's all about what country?
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.300]   Life in Persia.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.400]   And then we're going all the way back to Job.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.560]   Okay, that's written in the time of Abraham.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:52.080]   Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.760]   Isaiah, what is Isaiah about?
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.440]   Weeping and then what's the latter 27 chapters about?
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.440]   Rejoicing because who's coming?
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.800]   Messiah's coming.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:10.080]   Jeremiah, Judah has become rotten like a sash.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.400]   Lamentations, Judah's gone.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   Temple's gone.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.480]   Everything's gone.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.440]   So the weeping that takes place.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:25.360]   Rejoice, feel, dry bones will come to life because God's going to intervene.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:33.820]   And then all of these, Hosea, Joel, Obadiah, Amos, Micah, Jonah, and Nahum we covered today.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.760]   Okay.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.560]   And then Habakkuk's Zephaniah is in this transitionary period.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:46.960]   Haggai, Zechariah, we're going to look at today because we're looking at all the R's.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.440]   And then you have your 39 books of the Old Testament.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:56.140]   So just review when you can, just this timeline again and again, and you will start getting
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.720]   less intimidated by the Old Testament.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.720]   Quick review.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.400]   Split, two, 722, what is that?
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:11.120]   930, two, the 722, and what's the two in the middle?
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.800]   Who do you think of?
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.800]   Bob Marley.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.840]   We are diamond, right?
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.840]   Okay.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:26.040]   Number four, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria, Jonah, Ahab, I'm sorry, Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah,
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.760]   Isaiah, Nahum.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.640]   And we looked at the poem last week.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.880]   Can anyone recite it for like two cents?
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.360]   All right, let's do it together.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:48.240]   "Soon to follow, 586, temples nixed, Jeremiah laments and wallows."
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.440]   And then, so Jeremiah lamentations, and what are the four books?
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:58.680]   Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zephaniah.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.800]   And how many visions were in Daniel that you need to pay attention to?
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   Three.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.560]   So, statue, beasts, son of man.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.000]   And this son of man is an important figure, right?
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   So 612, Assyria is shelved, Judah soon to follow, 586, temples nixed, Jeremiah laments
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   and wallows.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:27.840]   So, 612 is that A, 586 is the B, and then this, or the, and the B and the C are together,
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.880]   and then the D is a 586, right?
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:37.240]   So King-King split, ABCD, Medo-Persians return and Greeks.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.960]   King-King split, ABCD, Medo-Persians return and Greeks.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.040]   You can get the dates of the King-King split, no problem, right?
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.040]   40-40-40.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.480]   How about ABCD?
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.400]   A, B, C, D, no problem.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.800]   Now these, we're gonna look at today.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:58.280]   Okay, 538, RRR, and then 333.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.160]   Okay?
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.520]   So you guys know what the Hallelujah chorus is?
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:10.240]   Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, right?
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.400]   For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.400]   You know that, right?
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.160]   Sometimes it goes for 30 minutes at Christmas.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.960]   Did you know that's actually Revelation 11, 15?
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.520]   The seventh angel sounds his trumpets and there's a loud noise in the heavens.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.880]   And it says, "For the kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our God and of his
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.120]   Lord Jesus Christ, and he will reign forever and ever."
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.120]   So that's the final cry in Revelation.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:43.200]   But we're gonna learn a different song that'll help us remember all the details of the R's.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.400]   I call it the R1-Hallelujah chorus.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   Okay, that's a mouthful.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.080]   R1-Hallelujah chorus.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   Okay?
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.720]   So you know the song, right?
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.720]   You know the...
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:59.880]   (singing)
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.880]   Okay, so we're gonna do this, all right?
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.880]   Here we go.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:12.880]   (singing)
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.880]   Okay, you guys got it?
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.880]   So, what year did the MP come in?
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.880]   What year was the first return?
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.880]   Okay, you're gonna start hearing my voice in your head.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.880]   I apologize in advance, but God bless you, okay?
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:34.880]   (singing)
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.880]   No problem, right?
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.880]   So who was the king of Persia at this time?
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.880]   Okay, now you guys got that.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.880]   Try not to look at the lyrics.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   Try to look at my face, all right?
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.880]   Second line.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:53.880]   (singing)
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.880]   So what is the decree that was gone out?
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   They're supposed to build a temple again.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.880]   All right, let's try this.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   First two lines.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   (singing)
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.880]   Got it?
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.880]   You guys memorize it?
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.880]   One more time.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.880]   (singing)
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.880]   Sorry, exiles go.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:30.880]   (singing)
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.880]   They're supposed to build a temple.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.880]   (singing)
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.880]   Okay?
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.880]   (singing)
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.880]   Got it?
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:46.880]   So, what book, what sections of the Bible talk about this?
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.880]   Ezra 1 through 6, all right?
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:56.880]   (singing)
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.880]   Got it?
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.880]   From the beginning.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:08.880]   (singing)
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.880]   They're supposed to build a temple.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.880]   (singing)
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.880]   Ezra 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.880]   (laughing)
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.880]   5, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 2.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.880]   So far, so good?
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.880]   Okay?
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.880]   And then 50K Jews returned to that place.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.880]   That K stands for thousand, all right?
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.880]   So, I had to work out the syllables, so just excuse it.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.880]   But just remember, all right?
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.880]   So, how many exiles returned?
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.880]   About 50,000.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.880]   49,697.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.880]   Okay, so 50,000 returned to that place.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.880]   And what's that place?
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.880]   Back to Jerusalem.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.880]   538, 538.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.880]   So, what year is the MP?
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.880]   538.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   Okay?
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.880]   Don't say 538, all right?
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.880]   There you go.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.880]   From the top.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.880]   Try to sing it without looking down.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:34.880]   (singing)
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.880]   You guys got it?
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.880]   Okay.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:43.880]   Now, the next verse, so that you know which two prophecies go with it,
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.880]   Hakariah.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.880]   So, what two books?
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.880]   Haggai, Zechariah.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.880]   Here we go.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:59.880]   (singing)
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.880]   So, who opposes the work of building the temple?
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.880]   The Samaritans.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880]   Who is that?
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.880]   The Samaritans.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.880]   Is that the Northern Kingdom people?
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.880]   No.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.880]   70 years, the land is barren, so the people come back and start living there.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.880]   They're now the Samaritans.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.880]   Okay?
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.880]   We are Americans.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.880]   Right?
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:26.880]   Did you know when I was in Uganda, the airport worker saw my passport,
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.880]   was like, "Are you from China or Korea or Japan?"
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.880]   I said, "America."
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.880]   He's like, "No, you're not."
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.880]   I said, "What are you talking about, I'm not?"
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.880]   He's like, "You have black hair."
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.880]   I was like, "Oh, my goodness.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.880]   How did I get this U.S. passport then?"
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.880]   Right?
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:47.880]   Because for him, for that person in Uganda, Americans are supposed to look a
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.880]   certain way.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.880]   So, that definition has changed.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.880]   Samaria is no longer the capital of the Northern Kingdom.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.880]   Samaria is a group of people that just started residing in this desolate land.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.880]   Okay?
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.880]   In the New Testament, that's going to change again.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.880]   They're going to be half-breeds in the New Testament.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.880]   So, whenever you hear Samaria, just know that that definition changes over the
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.880]   course of the Bible.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.880]   All right?
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:21.880]   ♪ Hakariya, hakariya, the Samaritans oppose Ayah, hakariya ♪
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.880]   Again.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:27.880]   ♪ Hakariya, hakariya, Samaritans oppose Ayah, hakariya ♪
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.880]   And then the next verse.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:36.880]   ♪ Hakariya, hakariya, Yahweh comes and rebukes Ayah, hakariya ♪
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.880]   Got it?
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.880]   And you know the tune.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.880]   ♪ Shesh, bazar, and zurub, abelid ♪
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:52.880]   ♪ Hakariya, hakariya, temple is finished in 516 ♪
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   ♪ Hakariya, hakariya ♪
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:00.880]   If you remember this really silly, dumb song, which in some ways I believe is
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.880]   divinely inspired, you will know what's going on in R1.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.880]   Got it?
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.880]   Okay.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.880]   Now, without looking up, let's try the hakariya again.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:19.880]   ♪ Hakariya, hakariya, the Samaritans oppose Ayah, hakariya ♪
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   ♪ Hakariya, hakariya, Yahweh comes and rebukes Ayah, hakariya ♪
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.880]   ♪ Shesh, bazar, and zurub, abelid ♪

[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.880]   ♪ Hakariya, hakariya ♪
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.880]   I was singing this to my wife, and she just rolled her eyes, but my kid started singing,
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   "Hakariya!"
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.880]   I thought it was hilarious.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:55.880]   So what two books of the Bible prophecies are about the first return?
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.880]   Haggai and Zechariah.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.880]   And what historical book is about this period?
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.880]   Ezra chapters 1 through 6.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.880]   And Ezra's not there yet.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.880]   He's writing in retrospect.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.880]   So shesh, bazar, and zurub, abelid.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.880]   And there's another guy named Yeshua who's the high priest, but I couldn't fit him into
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.880]   this song, but just keep that in reference.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:22.880]   So we'll try this song three times, just straight through both verses.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   And we'll go slow.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.880]   Okay?
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.880]   You guys ready?
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.880]   ♪ Five, three, ocho ♪

[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.880]   They're supposed to build a temple.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.880]   ♪ Five, three, ocho ♪

[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.880]   Oh my goodness, I'm making such a fool of myself.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   And this is recorded for everyone in the world to see.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.880]   All right, so, you guys got the details?
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.880]   Okay, let's think through the song again.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.880]   What year does the first return happen?
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.880]   538.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.880]   And what's their main responsibility?
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.880]   To rebuild the temple.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:57.880]   But what gets in the way?
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.880]   Who opposes them?
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.880]   The Samaritans.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.880]   But God rebukes them,
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.880]   and he inspires Haggai and Zechariah
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.880]   to preach into the situation.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   Shesh bazar and Zerubbabel get recharged and revamped.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.880]   And then 20 years after they started this project,
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   the work is finished in 516.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.880]   And that's all you really need to remember for R1.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.880]   How many exiles returned?
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.880]   About 50,000.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.880]   That's a minority of the people who are in, of the Jews.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.880]   Okay, that's not a lot of people.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.880]   All right?
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.880]   So, Haggai,
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.880]   Hag-ai.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.880]   So, he is holding the eye.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.880]   It has nothing to do with the theme.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.880]   It's just how you remember the book.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.880]   And there's a temple in the background,
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.880]   not at the front.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.880]   So, is the temple a priority for the people of God or not?
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.880]   It's not.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.880]   Haggai is actually speaking a lot into even our context today.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.880]   Is it time for you, yourselves, to live in paneled houses
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.880]   while my house remains a ruin, Haggai 1-4?
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.880]   Now, you kind of know the context.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.880]   The people, first of all, got opposed.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.880]   So, they're like, "Dude, God, if you told us and gave us this task,
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.880]   why did you not make it easier?
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.880]   The Samaritans are here opposing us.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   They're killing us.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.880]   They're hurting us.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.880]   Like, we have our children's mouths to feed.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.880]   We can't work on the temple."
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.880]   And then Haggai and Zechariah, God speaks to them and says,
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:43.880]   "Is it really--like, why do you think I've sent blithe and judgment?
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.880]   Because you guys are not focused on what you're supposed to do."
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.880]   That speaks a lot into our context today.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.880]   What's our priority to build the kingdom of God?
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.880]   But we get sidetracked by opposition.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.880]   We get sidetracked by disdirection.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.880]   We get sidetracked into building our own paneled houses.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.880]   So, it has a lot to say into our context.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.880]   Now you know the historical background.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.880]   So, rebuilding a new temple.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:12.880]   And Zechariah--Zechariah is about the kingdom of the Messiah that is to come.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.880]   And what happens when this Messiah comes?
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.880]   He brings a different temple.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.880]   Okay?
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:25.880]   And it is in the form of the body.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.880]   It is also now in the form of a future temple that is to be built.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.880]   So, Zechariah, the kingdom of the Messiah, yet to come.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.880]   Now, we're looking at the first R.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.880]   References, Ezra, 1 through 6.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.880]   This is all on there for you.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.880]   It's a little small print, but--
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:55.880]   Is it okay? The print's okay?
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:56.880]   Oh, I gave you blanks.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.880]   So, what's the date of this?
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.880]   5302.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.880]   Okay?
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.880]   538.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.880]   What's the references for this?
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.880]   Ezra's 1 through 6.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.880]   Who are the leaders?
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:18.880]   You have Shesh-Bazar, Zerubbabel, and Yeshua,
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.880]   who is the high priest.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.880]   He's the religious leader.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.880]   Okay?
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:30.880]   So, later, the religious leader for R3 is actually Ezra.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.880]   Okay?
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.880]   But in this first wave, it's Yeshua.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.880]   Zerubbabel is actually the David's line.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.880]   So, he's actually the--he's not a king because the king position's gone away,
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.880]   but he's royal line.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.880]   He's a governor.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.880]   Oops.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.880]   And then, what are the--who's a Persian king?
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.880]   Cyrus.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.880]   And then, what happens?
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.880]   First of all, Cyrus--Cyrus lets out a decree, Ezra 1-1.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.880]   In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia,
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:12.880]   King Cyrus sent a proclamation throughout all his kingdom
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.880]   and to fulfill the word of Jeremiah,
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.880]   and he put it in writing.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.880]   And what are the things that he put in writing?
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.880]   One, as many as wished could return.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.880]   So, whoever wants to go back, you all go back.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.880]   But how many people return?
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.880]   Only 50,000.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.880]   Okay?
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.880]   Because 70 years is a long time away from home.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.880]   And so, Jerusalem is not my home.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.880]   It's my great-grandfather's home.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.880]   I don't want to go to Jerusalem.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.880]   But only 50,000 went back.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.880]   So, the temple can be rebuilt, partially financed by the royal treasury.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.880]   We will give you money to do this.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.880]   And then, the goblets and then all the dishware and all the stuff
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:58.880]   that they took away from Solomon's temple, Cyrus returned it.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.880]   Actually, if you guys know the story of Daniel,
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.880]   you know at the end of Daniel,
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.880]   King Belteshazzar sees on the wall a hand,
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.880]   the writing on the wall, right?
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.880]   [speaking in Hebrew]
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.880]   Like, what does this mean?
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:18.880]   Today, the country is going to be taken out of your hands.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.880]   And Belteshazzar was holding a party,
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:26.880]   and he was drinking out of the holy -- what do you call it?
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.880]   Not goblet.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.880]   Holy grail?
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.880]   He was drinking out of this stuff.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:35.880]   And King Cyrus, who's righteous, he actually sends all of the articles
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.880]   that were taken out of the temple back.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.880]   He says, "You can take all of this back and put these in your new temple."
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.880]   So, how many people returned? 49,697.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.880]   And what are the things that happened?
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:53.880]   The temple was begun and sacrifices were made,
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.880]   but Ezra 3-3, they were scared.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.880]   They've come back into this ghetto wilderness.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.880]   There's nothing.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.880]   And now, they're like, they have no wall, they have no enclosure,
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.880]   so they're scared that they're going to get attacked.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.880]   So, they actually set up the altar and make sacrifices day and night.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.880]   Ezra 3-3, all right?
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.880]   The altar was established on its foundation for the people
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.880]   who were afraid because of the people of the land.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.880]   They offer burnt offerings to the Lord morning and night.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   Burnt offerings morning and evening.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.880]   So, that's what it says, Ezra 3-3.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.880]   And so, like, they're scared.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.880]   They don't know what to do.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.880]   But the temple is begun.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.880]   The Feast of Tabernacles is celebrated.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   The Samaritans make trouble.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.880]   And for the next 18 years, nothing's being done.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.880]   And then Haggai and Zechariah come,
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:46.880]   and then the temple is completed in 516.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.880]   So, the themes for Haggai and Zechariah is a call, really,
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.880]   to complete the reconstruction, the future restoration through Messiah.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.880]   The pictures, like, the wording is very similar.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.880]   Ezra 5-1, if you look back here, now Haggai the prophet
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.880]   and Zechariah the prophet, a descendant of Edo.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.880]   In the book of Zechariah, it actually says a son of Berechiah.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.880]   So, Edo is actually his grandfather.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.880]   Prophecy to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of God of Israel,
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.880]   who is over them.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.880]   But, you know, when they first started building this temple,
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.880]   look what happens.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.880]   Chapter 3, verse 12, "Yet many of the priests and Levites
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.880]   and heads of fathers' households, the old men
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.880]   who had seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.880]   when the foundation of this house laid before their eyes,
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.880]   while many shouted aloud for joy."
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.880]   So, these 70, 80, 90-year-old men who came back amongst the 50,000
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:47.880]   to rebuild this temple because that was their lamentation for 70 years.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.880]   So, now they're back, they're old, and they're frail,
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:52.880]   and these young men are building this new temple,
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.880]   and they're looking at it, and what do they do?
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.880]   They weep. Why do they weep?
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.880]   Because it's so big.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.880]   It's so small compared to Solomon's.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.880]   It's so dinky and shoddy compared to Solomon's.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.880]   But the young men are like, "Look at this great thing
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.880]   we're doing for the Lord."
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.880]   Actually, if you look at verse 13, it says,
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.880]   "And you could not distinguish between the sound of weeping
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.880]   and the sound of rejoicing when this was happening."
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.880]   So, the temple is starting to be rebuilt.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:23.880]   One more time with the hallelujah, the R1 hallelujah chorus,
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.880]   and then we're going to take a little break.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   You can remember the words?
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:34.880]   All right, here we go.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:39.880]   Five, three, ocho. Five, three, ocho.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.880]   Cyrus let the exiles go.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:46.880]   Five, three, e, ocho. Five, three, ocho.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.880]   Five, three, ocho.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.880]   They're supposed to build the temple.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   Five, three, e, ocho.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:58.880]   Ezra, one, two, three, four, five, and six.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.880]   Five, three, ocho. Five, three, ocho.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.880]   Fifty K. Jews returned to that place.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.880]   Five, three, ocho. Five, three, ocho.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.880]   Hecariah. Hecariah.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.880]   Sesmeritans opposeiah.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:18.880]   Hecariah. Hecariah. Hecariah.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.880]   Hecariah. Hecariah.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.880]   Hecariah. Hecariah.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.880]   Hecariah. Hecariah.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:35.880]   Temple is finished in 516.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.880]   Hecariah. Hecariah.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.880]   Okay, good.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:46.880]   Memorize that song before I trademark it, okay?
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.880]   So, what I want you guys to do is just quickly ask each other these questions.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.880]   This is all pretty much from what we covered today, okay?
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:01.880]   And then we'll take a little bit of a break until 1125.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:30.880]   Find a partner, go over this together.
