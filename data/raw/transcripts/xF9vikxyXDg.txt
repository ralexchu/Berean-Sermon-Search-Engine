[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   Alright, good morning. Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.600]   As you guys know, I came back from a short break.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.600]   And at the beginning of that break I was out in India and I wanted to give you a brief update of what's going on.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   And the pastors there sent me a little video, or I was able to get a little video saying
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:22.600]   thank you and hello to our church. And I tried to upload it on the Facebook but it didn't work.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.600]   So Facebook was broken. So when it's no longer broken it should be up.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:31.600]   Okay? So you can go check it out sometime this week. Hopefully I can get it to work.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   Just a couple things I want you to be aware of. We haven't been able to go out to India for several years
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   because of what's been going on. And we are hoping, part of the reason why I wanted to go there is
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.600]   obviously I wanted to check up on the pastors and see how they're doing. We needed to get some resources to them
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   so that they can use that to support their ministry. But the other reason was I wanted to see if we can
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   get back in there. Like is it okay? Is it going to be too hard to travel and to get to the places that we're at?
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.600]   And so the conclusion that I came with is that India has actually opened up more than the other Asian countries.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   And so Delta was so severe over there. They informed me that not only Pastor Isaac, who was the main guy
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   that was going to take over that ministry, but several of the pastor's wives passed away.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   And then their friends from other ministries, they've also experienced it quite a bit.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.600]   So they said almost everybody there knows somebody who passed from Delta.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.600]   But as a result of that, because it spread so widely and their vaccine kind of got there so late
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.600]   that now, you know, there's almost like a herd immunity. The numbers there are pretty low.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   And so it is capable. We are able to come in and travel and do the things that we were doing before.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:51.600]   And they are not demanding vaccination. They're only demanding that you get tested before you come.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   So as long as you have a negative COVID test, you're able to come into the country and function.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   So we are planning to get back in there in January. And so I know some people have been asking us
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.600]   when that's going to happen. And then so within the next couple of months, when we make the final decision
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.600]   and we come with solid dates, I'll let you guys know. And even though it is a medical mission,
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.600]   you don't have to be a medical doctor. We have eye doctors that come in. That's kind of our primary work.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.600]   And then people come in and do the assisting work. So we need more assistance than the eye doctor.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   We only need about three or four eye doctors. And then everybody else will come and assist their work.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:32.600]   So the work that we've been doing there has been, again, very helpful because it gives them a platform
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.600]   to preach the gospel. And those of you who've been there with us know just how effective it is
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.600]   because they're able to get into villages that they would not normally go into.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   In fact, the last time we were there, we had a young pastor, probably in his late 20s, who was a schoolteacher.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.600]   He's more educated than most of the pastors there. And he functioned as one of the translators for us.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.600]   And he was trying to break into this new village, but because he was so young, and it's a very Asian culture,
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.600]   and so because he was so young, he was having a hard time even being able to talk to them.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   And obviously because Hinduism is the prominent religion there, they were just kind of brushing him off
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   and kind of like, "Who's this young guy coming in here?" And so we were able to set up our medical camp there.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   And you could tell the attitude toward that pastor started changing even while we were there
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.600]   because they were so thankful that we were there ministering to them.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   And they're very surprised that even though we're Christians, that we were ministering to the Hindus.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.600]   And that gave them the platform to be able to speak to them.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   And then the information that we got after we left was that the village leaders actually invited him to come
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.600]   after we left because they were so thankful. And so he had an opportunity to share the gospel
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   and begin church planting in that village. And so one of the things that has happened,
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:54.600]   obviously the Delta and Pastor Isaac passing away as a result, but they're just as active as they were
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   spreading the gospel, but the persecution has increased exponentially during the lockdowns.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.600]   And so when we first started going in, they were listed at number 30-something,
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.600]   and then by the time we, I think it was locked down, they were ranked number 10,
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.600]   the hardest place to be a Christian in the world.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:20.600]   This is like with Yemen and North Korea and all these countries, and so India is starting to creep up.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.600]   And so I haven't looked at the latest numbers, but from what I've been told,
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.600]   that if it was bad two years ago, it's gotten much worse than that.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   And so one of the things that they told us was not only the physical danger that they're in
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   when they go into these new villages, is that now the local government has openly declared
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.600]   that they're not going to support the Christian families going to public school,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.600]   because they function with some kind of voucher system where the parents get the funding,
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.600]   they use that to send their kids to school, but they have openly said that they're not giving it to Christians anymore.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   So I asked them, "So what do you do with your kids?"
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:01.600]   They said, "So some of the parents who have some resources are able to get their kids into some discounted schools,
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.600]   like a Catholic school, which gives them some discount, but a lot of the village pastors
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.600]   are taking their children out to the fields.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   So when they work, their 5-, 6-, 7-, 80-year-old kids are also in the field working with them
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.600]   because they have no other option."
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.600]   So it's a concerted, long-term effort from the government to weed out Christianity in the country.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.600]   And so they're making it impossible for Christians to raise their children,
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:31.600]   and I think their hope is that by the time those children are adults, that Christianity will be weeded out.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   So the conversation that we've been having, I already brought this up with our leaders,
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   and I'm in the midst of talking to trying to get other churches involved in helping us possibly establish a school
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:49.600]   for these Christian children, and I've already had a brief conversation with them,
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:55.600]   like are they able to run a school if we provided the support and bought land and made the building
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   and gave the financial support, and they said they are able to.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:04.600]   So we're hoping that that would be our next project, that we're engaging, along with our medical missions that we're doing.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.600]   There are other things that I'd like to update, but for the sake of time, I'll just leave that for now.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:16.600]   But the work in India will reopen, and again, if you are praying about going back out with us,
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.600]   in about a month or two, we'll give a formal announcement for you to sign up.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:26.600]   And again, we can only take anywhere from 12 to 13 people, so if you are praying about it,
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.600]   make sure when we give the announcements to try to sign up as soon as you can.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   All right, along with that, today there's a newcomer's lunch happening at 115, so if you signed up for that,
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:42.600]   please stick around in the sanctuary, and lunch will be had here.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.600]   Summer Maintenance Day, so today is a church cleanup day, so if you are free around 3.30,
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.600]   whether you signed up or didn't sign up and you're free at 3.30, 3.30 to 6 o'clock,
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   you'll be given some guidance as how to implement this, so if you can just come back to church at 3.30,
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.600]   we'll give you instructions on what to do.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   Berean membership class, a new round of membership classes happening starting from July 10th at 9 a.m.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.600]   It's an eight-week course, and so that will take place during our first service at 9 a.m., so please sign up for that.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.600]   And then child care safety training, if you are working with children or planning to work with children,
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:22.600]   in our Sunday school, July 3rd at 1 p.m., there is a mandatory training for you, so please come to that.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:31.600]   And then finally, on July 10th at 1 p.m., we have a seasoned community group fellowship, seasoned meaning you're 50 or over.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:37.600]   Previously, we said 40 and over, but 40 is no longer seasoned, okay, so we moved that up, okay,
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:43.600]   so you need a little bit more time to be seasoned, so 50 and over, so if you're in that category, please sign up for that.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   It'll be on the church website, or you can contact me directly.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:53.600]   The lunch fee is going to be $10, and I mentioned this before. We have people who are over 50.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:58.600]   When you first enter the church, we just—first reaction is, "Oh, man, this is a church filled with college students,"
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.600]   and then you get to know the church a little bit. It's like, "Oh, there's a lot of young adults in here,"
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.600]   but you'd be surprised. We have over 70 people, over 50, at our church.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   Even I was surprised by that, you know, and so we're going to—again, if you're a part of that, you don't have to be a member.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:20.600]   If you want to come and participate in the fellowship, please sign up for that, and again, the lunch price will be $10, okay?
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:27.600]   All right, so let me pray for us for the offering, and then after that, our brother Brayden Woo is going to come give his testimony.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.600]   He'll be baptized this morning. Let's pray.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.600]   Gracious Father, we thank you for your mercy and grace for God that sustains us.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:45.600]   I pray that no matter what we've been distracted by this week, this month, help us to give our full attention to worshiping you,
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:53.600]   to calibrate our hearts, our thoughts, our hopes to be in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   I pray that you would bless this offering. May it be multiplied for your use, for your kingdom, for the spreading of the gospel.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:40.600]   Hi, my name is Braden Wu and I am a finished second year at UCI studying business admin.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:46.600]   Growing up, I was born into a Christian home and I went to church pretty much every Sunday.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.600]   My mom was a Sunday school teacher and my dad was pretty involved in the church too,
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   so I had known a lot about all the Bible stories and what the right answers were.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.600]   When I was in first or second grade, my mom gave me a gospel presentation
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.600]   and walked me through what it took to believe.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   Partly because I wanted to be a part of the club my big sister was in,
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.600]   and partly because I wasn't sure what it meant, and partly because I was scared of death,
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.600]   I prayed a prayer and superficially asked Jesus into my heart.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.600]   I continued going to church throughout elementary school,
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.600]   and through my conduct outside of church, it was pretty evident that I had not been truly saved.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.600]   The life I had lived had been only to serve myself and to truly pursue all that I felt that I wanted.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.600]   I turned away from everything I had said I wanted to believe in, and I lived in a worldly life.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.600]   I didn't care how I treated others, and I only lived to do things that made me happy.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.600]   I truly was a self-centered sinner.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   It didn't help that around this time I started to competitively play hockey,
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   and I would have to drive about an hour to and from practice three to four times a week,
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.600]   which meant that I had not a lot of time to focus on church or that part of my life.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.600]   And more than just simply focusing on something else, it was focusing on myself,
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:01.600]   choosing to indulge in what I wanted to do, and turning my back on attending weekly service.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.600]   Pairing this with the fact that my family had recently started attending a new church
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:11.600]   meant that I had a few, not many friends there, and it just led me to not wanting to attend church all that much.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.600]   I continued in this mindset up through middle school, and even though I still considered myself a Christian,
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.600]   I had no understanding of what that truly meant.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:24.600]   Through God's great grace, it turned out that I would begin to realize what following Christ truly meant through hockey.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:30.600]   In the summer, entering high school, I attended a hockey camp run by Christians,
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   and one of the nights when we were singing for worship, it dawned on me that I was a sinner,
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.600]   a truly terrible person, and I was in need of a savior.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   I saw the grace that God had given us, and how through the death of Jesus Christ I could receive this grace through faith.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:50.600]   Ephesians 2, 4-5 says, "But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us,
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.600]   even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.600]   By grace you have been saved."
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.600]   And 1 Timothy 1-15 says, "It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance,
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all."
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   These two verses sum up a lot of what I realized at that time,
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   knowing that I was a dead sinner, the worst even,
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   but that I could receive grace from a perfectly loving God through Jesus' death and life through his resurrection.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   That night I prayed that I would turn from all the various sins that I had been living in, and that I would be forgiven.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.600]   This was only the beginning of my understanding, because although the desire was there,
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.600]   I felt that I kept being set back through a lack of consistent Bible reading and continually falling into sin.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.600]   Thankfully God was still able to work in me, and although at the time I couldn't see it,
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.600]   getting cut from the highest level of hockey was one of the biggest blessings in my life.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:44.600]   It afforded me more time to go to church, growing in my friendships, but more importantly in spirit.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.600]   Around the same time I was going through some high school,
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:53.600]   a drama which concluded with the realization that God had a perfect plan for me, and that I could trust him with my future.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.600]   A verse that I kept with me from that time was Matthew 6, 33-34, from the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.600]   The verse reads, "But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.600]   So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.600]   That verse encouraged me that I didn't need to live in anxiousness,
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.600]   because ultimately all I needed would be provided as I strived to live in his righteousness.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   I sought out discipleship at my home church and slowly began to grow as I learned more and more about God's person and my own sin.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.600]   Bible reading became more consistent and I saw growth in the way that I learned to pray.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.600]   Today, by God's grace, I have been able to find a church in which I feel that I am growing a lot.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:38.600]   I am challenged every day to live every moment for the glory of God, and I have continued to grow in my spiritual disciplines.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.600]   Romans 12, 1-2 summarizes a lot of what I have been learning this year.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:47.600]   "Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God,
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.600]   which is your spiritual service of worship.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds,
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:58.600]   so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect."
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.600]   I see how good he is, and I desire to glorify him in all that I do,
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   walking faithfully day by day, being sanctified, and continuing to humble myself in submission and obedience to God.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.600]   I had been hesitant in the past about being baptized because I felt that I had to be a better Christian,
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   but I have come to learn that baptism isn't about being the perfect Christian,
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.600]   but rather being obedient to Christ and a public profession that Jesus is my Lord and Savior.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.600]   Thank you.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:30.600]   [applause]
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   [silence]
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:08.600]   [applause]
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:14.600]   Thank you, Brayden, for that great testimony, and for all you college students.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.600]   They're almost cultic, the way they stick together.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:22.600]   [laughter]
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:28.600]   If you could turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 1, verse 39 to verse 46,
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:34.600]   and I'm going to read the whole of it, reading out of the NASB.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.600]   Luke chapter 1, verse 39 through 46.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:42.600]   "Now at this time Mary arose and went in a hurry to the hill country, to a city of Judah,
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.600]   and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.600]   When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb,
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.600]   and Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit, and she cried out with a loud voice and said,
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   'Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.600]   And how has it happened to me that the mother of my Lord would come to me?
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:08.600]   For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:15.600]   And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what has been spoken to her by the Lord.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.600]   Mary said, 'My soul exalts the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.600]   For he has had regard for the humble state of his bond slave.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.600]   For behold, from this time on, all generations will count me blessed.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   For the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   And his mercy is upon generation after generation, for those who fear him.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.600]   He has done mighty deeds with his arms.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   He has scattered those who are proud in the thoughts of their heart.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.600]   He has brought down the rulers from their thrones and exalted those who are humble.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.600]   He has filled the hungry with good things and sent away the rich empty-handed.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.600]   He has given help to Israel, his servant, in remembrance of his mercy,
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and his descendants forever.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.600]   And Mary stayed with her about three months and then returned to her home.'"
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.600]   Let's pray.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   Help us to glean and understand more than just thoughts, but your very heart.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:20.600]   Help us, Lord God, to be moldable as you are the potter and we are the clay.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.600]   You know, as I start and jump back into the book of Luke,
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.600]   I wanted to highlight, and it is kind of related to the text that we're at,
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.600]   but it is not the point of the sermon.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   If you notice in Luke chapter 1, as Elizabeth is speaking to Mary,
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   the way she says, "The baby inside of her leaped."
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   And she was about six months pregnant already when this happens.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:52.600]   And she recognizes that Mary is pregnant with the child of God, the son of God.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:36:00.600]   I want to highlight here, because of something spectacular that has happened this week.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.600]   Roe v. Wade has been overturned.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.600]   And those of you who have been Christian for a while,
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:12.600]   you know the struggle that Christians have had for over 50 years.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   Because if there is one law we can say with confidence was evil, was this law.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.600]   It was evil.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.600]   Because it was a specific targeting of a child.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.600]   And it has progressively gotten more evil through the years
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   because more and more there's been conversations about even terminating that baby
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.600]   after it comes out of the mother's womb.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:40.600]   Because if the intention was to kill the baby, it is not a baby, even after it was born.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:45.600]   I don't know how a Christian could possibly defend that.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.600]   But to my shock and surprise, in the last few years,
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.600]   we've had Christians, sometimes even leadership,
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.600]   somehow defending and almost supporting.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:02.600]   And so, again, it shouldn't be a shock if we've been seeing the degradation of the church,
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.600]   where the Bible has been taken out,
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   where right and wrong has no longer been centralized in the scripture.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   It's more of what you're hearing from society,
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   that even the church leaders are more concerned about how non-Christians who do not obey God,
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.600]   how they would be offended by certain positions that we take,
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.600]   than offending God himself.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.600]   When we say we are a God-centered worshiping church,
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.600]   that's first and foremost in our priority.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:35.600]   That our first concern is that we live in such a way where we honor God.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.600]   That we are God-fearers, first and foremost.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.600]   Not the fears of our culture, not the fear of ramification,
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.600]   of certain decisions that we make or certain things that we say.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:51.600]   This issue of abortion is not a debatable issue in the church.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.600]   Let me make that very clear.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.600]   That there's nobody in this church where they say,
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.600]   "Oh, you know, I know some Christians who don't think so."
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.600]   It is not a debatable issue in the church,
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.600]   because the Bible makes it absolutely crystal clear,
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.600]   the high view of life that God has.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:12.600]   And the only reason why he sent his only begotten son is because he has such high view of life.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.600]   The text that we're looking at, again, that's not the point of the sermon this morning.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:23.600]   It makes it clear that the baby, the human being in the life of Elizabeth, jumped for joy.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:29.600]   And they recognized the baby in Mary, who was just conceived.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:35.600]   That the life in there recognized the life in the other human being.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   Now, if you've been a Christian for any period of time,
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.600]   I know that you've been talking, debating, and maybe, you know, maybe even within the church,
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.600]   maybe even with other Christians.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.600]   I don't think this is just a Christian view.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.600]   This is a humanity view.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   In our culture, life is sacred, whether you are a Christian or a non-Christian.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.600]   We all universally believe, and obviously as Christians,
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.600]   we believe that God has inputted that inside every human being,
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.600]   a sense of moral compass, even though the world has gotten lost,
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.600]   that there is sacredness to life.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:17.600]   And because there is sacredness to life, if there is a possibility of harming a human being,
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.600]   you can get arrested and put into jail for that purpose if you intended that.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   If somebody comes in this room and shoots a gun off, and it didn't hit anybody,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.600]   but there was a possibility of hitting a human being,
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.600]   you would be guilty of that, not because you murdered,
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   but because there was a possibility that you could have murdered.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.600]   You know, the argument that they've been saying is like,
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.600]   "Well, you know, is it really life when they're conceived?"
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:49.600]   At minimum, whether Christian or non-Christian, there has always been a debate, right?
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.600]   Christian or non-Christian, that there is a possibility of life.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.600]   There's a reason why, whether you're a Christian or not,
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   if somebody gets pregnant, they celebrate,
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.600]   and they say that there's life in that individual.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.600]   This is not a Christian view.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:10.600]   Only when they decide to terminate it, they stop calling it a baby.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:21.600]   So, is it a sound argument to say that at minimum, there's a possibility that that's a child?
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:27.600]   And if that's a possibility that's a child, that is enough to get you indicted, to terminate that.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.600]   And yet, that's the argument that has been made,
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:35.600]   and it has been progressively that even with the child completely formed in the mother's body,
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:40.600]   that somehow, the conscience of our world has been seared to the point
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.600]   where even if they are fully delivered,
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   their lawmakers in this country have been debating that we could terminate that
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   because if our intention was to kill the baby, the baby is no longer a real baby.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.600]   That's how far we have gone.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:01.600]   What has been disturbing me is that the church has become so secular
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:06.600]   that even within the church, I've been hearing within the last year or so
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.600]   that this is possibly a debatable issue.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:16.600]   There is nothing more arrogant than to even to use the term
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:22.600]   that if a woman gets pregnant, that it is her choice.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.600]   It is her choice. She is the sovereign.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:31.600]   Even if it's a possibility of a child, you are not sovereign over that life.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:38.600]   So as Roe v. Wade has been overturned, it is a cause to celebrate.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:44.600]   But I also want to caution all of us that just because that has been overturned,
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.600]   the world has not become brighter.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.600]   People are not more receptive to the gospel because of that.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:57.600]   In fact, the people who have been fighting for pro-choice are probably even more angered.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:03.600]   In fact, all the churches have been put on notice that if you start preaching against this,
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.600]   that you will be targeted.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:13.600]   So we've been seeing on the news churches being targeted, protested, coming inside the church.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.600]   Who knows? Maybe that may happen here.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.600]   But this is not a debatable issue.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.600]   Not inside the church.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   Christians can have that view and not have this view.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:34.600]   It is crystal clear that God has a very clear view of what is life and what that life means to God.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.600]   And so we celebrate that.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.600]   We are cautious that we don't think that the fight is over.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.600]   I don't think it's over.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.600]   As long as we live in this dark world, the fight is going to continue.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.600]   But as we fight for this, because we live in a free country,
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:59.600]   we have to also recognize that the only way that people truly change is through the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:05.600]   We can change all the laws to reflect who God is and the scriptural principles,
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.600]   but nothing will change other than the law unless the gospel penetrates into the hearts of people.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.600]   So as we celebrate this change of law,
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:18.600]   which again, I know many Christians have been fighting, praying over this for many, many years,
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:24.600]   that all the more that we need to commit to the gospel getting to the remotest part of the world.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.600]   Now again, this is not the point of my sermon this morning.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.600]   I'm hoping maybe out in the future that we can spend more time,
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:38.600]   because I've spent so many countless hours debating and researching and talking in the last 30, 40 years
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.600]   of talking to non-Christians and sometimes trying to explain to young Christians
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:48.600]   why this is such an important issue, because once you denigrate life,
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:54.600]   everything else falls apart with that. It's not just one law.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:59.600]   We are already in rebellion against God, but this is the ultimate shaking of fists toward God
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.600]   that life does not belong to you. I do whatever I want with it.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.600]   And so again, this is not the point of the sermon, but again,
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:13.600]   you don't have to do deep theological search to find out that this ought to be Christian view.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:18.600]   Just from this text alone, God recognizes there's life in that, in both of these women.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.600]   One woman who's six months, another woman who just got pregnant.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:27.600]   Both of them, it's explained that there's a child in them.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:35.600]   Now having said that, Mary has this encounter, and this next section in verse 46 to 56,
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.600]   the theologians call this Mary's Magnificat.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:43.600]   And they call this Mary's Magnificat because the word "magnificat" basically means to magnify.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:49.600]   And so this section is Mary just spontaneously breaking out into worship.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:56.600]   And you and I already know that every Sunday we have prescribed worship.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   So on Sunday at 9 o'clock, 11 o'clock, depending on which service you go to.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.600]   And then when you come, you know what to expect.
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.600]   Sometimes we have baptism, testimony, we'll sing some songs, give offering,
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.600]   and then you'll hear a sermon, and then you'll hear benediction, and then we go home.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.600]   We have fellowship and we go home.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   That's prescribed, right?
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.600]   Prescribed by God.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.600]   So we're trying to follow that.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:22.600]   But if you've been a Christian long enough, you know that the best worship sometimes is not prescribed.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.600]   It's spontaneous, right?
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.600]   Where you recognize the grace of God.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.600]   Maybe it was an answered prayer, maybe something happened.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   Or you just came to a revelation of God's presence, and you just break out into worship.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.600]   And it doesn't have to be Sunday morning, right?
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:39.600]   It could be in the morning.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.600]   It could be at night.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:45.600]   It could be while you're driving, and you just break out into genuine worship.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.600]   Some of the best worship is spontaneous, and that's exactly what's happening here,
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   where Mary recognizes God's blessing upon her, and she just breaks out into worship.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:00.600]   Verse 46, "My soul exalts the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.600]   For he has had regard for the humble state of the bond slave.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.600]   For behold, from that time on, all generations will count me blessed.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.600]   For the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is His name,
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:17.600]   and His mercy is upon generation after generation for those who fear Him."
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:24.600]   So in this magnificat, in this exaltation of God, I want to highlight two things that Mary says,
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:28.600]   where she recognizes why she is so blessed.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:32.600]   We're in this--I'm not going to go line for line and tell you what the meaning behind it is,
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:37.600]   but in summary of what she says in this text, there's two things that she highlights
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:42.600]   to say that this is the reason why she is blessed and why she's breaking out into worship.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:49.600]   One, Mary was blessed because she believed, simply because she believed.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:55.600]   In Luke 1:45, it says, "Blessed is she who believed that there would be fulfillment
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:59.600]   of what has been spoken to her by the Lord."
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:04.600]   Now remember what that means because prior to that, remember the story before that,
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:11.600]   where the angel Gabriel tells Zacharias and Elizabeth that you're going to have a child.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.600]   And remember, because he had a hard time believing.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.600]   We're of old age. Even though we've been praying for this all our life,
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:23.600]   my wife is beyond age of childbirth, and so am I.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.600]   So how can this happen?
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:31.600]   And so because of his unbelief, he was basically--he couldn't speak for nine months.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.600]   But can you imagine if that was hard to believe?
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.600]   An old man and an old woman having a child.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:44.600]   If that was hard to believe, the angel Gabriel basically told Mary that you, a virgin,
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   if it's impossible for somebody who's that age to have a child,
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.600]   a virgin's going to have a child.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.600]   And that's not the incredible part.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.600]   The incredible part is that it's going to be the Messiah.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:01.600]   And it's not just the Messiah, it's the Son of God who's going to come through your womb.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.600]   So if it was impossible, difficult for Zacharias to believe that,
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.600]   can you imagine how difficult that would have been for Mary to believe that?
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:13.600]   And so Gabriel speaks to her and says, "Nothing is impossible with God."
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:19.600]   And Mary responds in verse 38, "Behold, the bond slave of the Lord may it be done to me
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.600]   according to your word."
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.600]   And so she believes it.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.600]   As difficult as that prophecy was, she believes it with all her heart.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:35.600]   And then it is because of this belief, she breaks out into what will happen.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.600]   Now let me point out here.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.600]   When she starts singing, did it happen?
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.600]   It didn't happen yet.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.600]   Nothing has happened.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:51.600]   All that has happened was that there was a prophecy given to her, that you've been chosen,
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   that God is going to give you this favor.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:58.600]   And because she believes, she breaks out into spontaneous worship.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   The basis of Christian worship is always faith.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   It's not because it has happened.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:11.600]   Our worship is only dependent upon when something good happens.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.600]   We were sick and we prayed and then God answered our prayers.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.600]   And thank God for that.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:20.600]   We had a relational issue and it got mended.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.600]   You had some financial struggle and you found a job.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.600]   And so all of those things are reasons for praising God.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:35.600]   But true worship, spontaneous worship, is based upon God's promise.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.600]   See, when she broke into this praise, nothing has happened yet.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   It's simply because she believed.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:47.600]   Our worship is not contingent upon the goodness that we see with our eyes.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.600]   Our worship is based upon the promise that He has made.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:59.600]   That no matter what happens during this lifetime, that God of glory is coming.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.600]   That because Christ died for us and we've been covered by the blood of Christ,
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.600]   when the judgment comes, we will be spared.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.600]   And when He is glorified, we will be glorified with Him in eternity.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:13.600]   He will wipe away our tears. He will wipe away our tears.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:18.600]   Though you may be crying now, He says He will one day wipe away your tears.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.600]   You may be sick now, but one day you will be whole.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:28.600]   You may have experienced tragedy and you may not find resolution during this lifetime.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:36.600]   But because you believe in the promise of God, true life, true joy is coming with Christ.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:41.600]   So our worship is not based upon simply answered prayer here.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.600]   Our worship is not simply because we see good things and blessings happening,
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:51.600]   simply because we got married or had kids or our business is doing well.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   It's based upon God's promise.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   In fact, Hebrews 11 verse 1 says, "Now faith is assurance of things hoped for."
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:03.600]   Hoped for. Not things that we see, not because it's happening,
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:07.600]   but because we hope and we believe in the promise that God has made to us,
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.600]   the conviction of things not seen.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:17.600]   So if our joy is only dependent on what we see and what's happening around us now,
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   it comes and then it goes.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:24.600]   You're worshiping one day, questioning God another day.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.600]   Things are great when you're financially good,
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.600]   and then when things are difficult, where are you?
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:34.600]   I have no reason to praise God because He's not answering my prayer.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:40.600]   Mary's worship and her blessedness came directly as a result because she believed.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:44.600]   She believed this fantastic thing that the angel has said.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.600]   In fact, Hebrews 11 verse 6, it goes on and says,
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.600]   "And without faith it is impossible to please Him,
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:54.600]   for he who comes to God must believe that He is and He is a rewarder of those who seek Him."
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:58.600]   That's a Christian life in a nutshell.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:02.600]   Yeah, you know, I work hard at church and I share the gospel and I'm serving,
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.600]   I'm raising my children, I'm doing all these things.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:10.600]   But the central question to a Christian is, do you believe?
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.600]   Do you truly believe?
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.600]   And does your faith affect your worship?
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.600]   Does your faith affect your life?
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   In Romans 4, 3, it says, "For what does the Scripture say?
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:26.600]   Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness."
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:31.600]   Not because he forsook everything and left and as a result he became a righteous man.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:35.600]   He said because he was righteous because of faith, he did righteous things.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:43.600]   The whole book of chapter 11 describes people because of faith, what they ended up doing.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:48.600]   I mean, we have to caution here because whenever we talk about salvation by faith alone,
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.600]   we always have a contingent of people who hear that and say,
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.600]   "Oh, so our hard work doesn't matter."
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:59.600]   So anybody who talks about how we need to be disciplined and strive after God, that's legalism.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:07.600]   The whole chapter 11 of Hebrews describes because of faith, they walked in faith.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:11.600]   Verse 7, "By faith, Noah being warned by God about things not yet seen,
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.600]   in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household."
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:18.600]   Noah just, "Oh, I have faith so I can just sit here and then because of faith,
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.600]   you know, everything's going to be okay."
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.600]   He said because of faith, he acted in obedience.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:28.600]   The proof of his faith was his life, but the cause of righteousness was his faith.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:32.600]   By faith, Abraham when he was called, obeyed.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:40.600]   So the central question that we have in our worship, in our walk toward God is do we believe?
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.600]   Let me phrase it another way.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:49.600]   Is my work based on achieving or believing?
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.600]   Let me say that again.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.600]   Is our hard work and discipline and pursuit of holiness and righteousness,
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:01.600]   is it based upon achieving or believing?
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   It may sound like semantics, but the difference is night and day.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.600]   The end result and what it produces is night and day.
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:15.600]   You know, when you're in the world, you have all these things like we're going to build,
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   we're going to work hard, we're going to do all these things,
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.600]   and your desire to become somebody.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.600]   And sometimes if we're not careful, you've taken all of those principles
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:27.600]   and all you've done is transferred it into the church.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.600]   And so you're still pursuing yourself.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.600]   You're still working hard, but it's not simply because you believe.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:41.600]   It just happens that your culture and your community happens to be around Christians.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.600]   So when you are working hard in that context,
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:49.600]   all you have to do is change their circumstance and they're no longer working.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:55.600]   They're no longer striving because their labor wasn't because of faith.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.600]   They were trying to achieve.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:04.600]   And so Mary's worship, it breaks out in praising and thanking God because she believed.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.600]   But I want to spend more time on the second part of it
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:13.600]   because this is something that we all know, we all recognize,
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:17.600]   and we all struggle with 100%.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:24.600]   If there's any place where I feel like there's a universal blind spot is this.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.600]   Mary was blessed because she was humble.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:31.600]   Not despite that she was humble, because she was humble.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.600]   We may look at Mary and say, you know, despite the fact that she was young,
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.600]   despite the fact that she comes from this obscure city,
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.600]   despite the fact that she doesn't have any recognition or education,
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.600]   despite all of that, God chose her.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   That's not what it says.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:51.600]   In fact, the scripture says over and over again it's because she was humble.
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:57.600]   Verse 48 says, "For he has had regard for me, for the humble state of his bond slave.
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:01.600]   For behold, from this time on, all generations will count me blessed."
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:04.600]   And then she goes further on and describes basically redemptive history,
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.600]   what God has been doing.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.600]   "For the mighty one has done great things for me, and holy is his name,
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:16.600]   and his mercy is upon generation after generation toward those who fear him."
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:20.600]   Who does God work with? People who recognize who he is and who fear him.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:25.600]   And then it goes, Mary's worship says, "He has done mighty deeds with his arm."
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.600]   And what does this mighty deeds look like?
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:32.600]   "He has scattered those who are proud in the thoughts of their heart.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.600]   He has brought down the rulers from their thrones,
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   and has exalted those who are humble.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:42.600]   He has filled the hungry with good things, and sent away the rich empty-handed."
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:47.600]   Mary is not describing a small portion of redemptive history.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:55.600]   Mary is describing the promise that the Messiah, the Son of God, was going to come,
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:02.600]   and she bursts out explaining what God has been doing and what he's coming to do.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:10.600]   That Christ is going to come, and he's going to humble the proud and raise up the humble.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:14.600]   We see a perfect picture of that in John chapter 3 and John chapter 4.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:17.600]   You have Nicodemus who's at the peak of his religious success,
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.600]   and God, Jesus Christ, just shuts the door on him.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.600]   "You cannot enter the kingdom this way.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:26.600]   Unless you are born again, you cannot enter the kingdom."
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.600]   In other words, all your righteous deeds, everything that you have achieved,
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.600]   cannot get you into the kingdom.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:36.600]   Then he talks to a Samaritan woman, a sinner, adulteress,
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:42.600]   who's even embarrassed for Jesus, for even talking to him, talking to her during the day.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:49.600]   And then he pursues her, deals with her sin, and then invites her into the kingdom.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:52.600]   She becomes the first evangelist to the Samaritans.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:58.600]   So you see the high, how he humbles them, and he brings the low, and then he raises them up.
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:04.600]   And that's, in essence, how the gospel is described to us.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.600]   Spurgeon says, of humility, this is what he says,
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:16.600]   "Every Christian has a choice of being humble or being humbled."
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.600]   Let me say this again.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:25.600]   Every Christian has a choice of being humble or being humbled.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:33.600]   Think about how hard we work to be somebody.
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.600]   Think about how hard we work.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:37.600]   You wake up in the morning.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:41.600]   All of you, 100%, look better here than you are at home.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:44.600]   I've seen you at home, right?
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:48.600]   Because every time we walk out, we're aware of other people's views on us,
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:54.600]   so everything that we do, even something trivial as doing our hair and brushing our teeth.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:58.600]   Because we want to present ourselves in a certain way.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   Why do we choose certain schools?
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.600]   Why do we choose certain jobs?
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.600]   Why do we have to drive certain cars?
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:12.600]   Why do we have to have a certain amount of money,
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.600]   live in a certain type of house?
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:18.600]   Even in the way we raise our children, you need to succeed.
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.600]   Succeed for what purpose?
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:26.600]   Almost every aspect of our life has been tainted by this desire to exalt ourselves,
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:31.600]   and exalting ourselves is at the core of human sin.
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:33.600]   We've been created to reflect His glory.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:38.600]   We were created to worship God, to adore God, to reflect God,
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:45.600]   and at the core of human rebellion is desiring that some of that attention comes to me.
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:50.600]   And so whether we realize that or not, every part of our thought,
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   whether you say it loudly or you say it quietly,
[00:59:54.600 --> 01:00:00.600]   we all wrestle with what you think of me.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:04.600]   I'm perfectly fine until I meet somebody else who seems a little bit better,
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:08.600]   and all of a sudden I'm discontent.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:17.600]   In fact, all other sins stem from this--coveting, lying, murder.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.600]   All other sins come from this desire for self-exaltation.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:27.600]   In fact, God describes the sin of Israel this way, Hosea 13, 5 through 6,
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.600]   "I cared for you in the wilderness, in the land of the drought.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.600]   As they had their pasture, they became satisfied,
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.600]   and being satisfied, their heart became proud.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.600]   Therefore, they forgot me."
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.600]   They forgot me.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.600]   You see that pattern?
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:48.600]   God blesses them, and then they begin to think, like, maybe I did this,
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.600]   and then once they do this, they forget God.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:55.600]   So what precedes rebellion?
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.600]   Forgetting God.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.600]   I can do it.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:02.600]   That's why Jesus says it's hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:08.600]   because in all his riches, it's easy for him to think, I did it.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.600]   I made the right choice.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.600]   I started harder than other people.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.600]   I got the right job, made the right decisions.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:18.600]   I bought crypto early, bought the house when it was dipping,
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.600]   made some right choices in stocks.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.600]   I'm a good salesman.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.600]   I worked hard.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.600]   I achieved well.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.600]   I was patient with my children.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.600]   And so all of these good things happened because of my work,
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.600]   and as a result of that, quietly, we don't need him.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:41.600]   So God simply becomes a figurehead, a figurehead in the church,
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.600]   just like you hang a cross.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.600]   And so he's a figurehead in the church, but he's not the one that we submit to.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.600]   We're not desperate for him.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.600]   He describes Israel's sin.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.600]   Simply, they just became proud because things are going well.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.600]   I don't need him, and they rebelled.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.600]   In James 4:6, it says, "Therefore," it says,
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:05.600]   "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.600]   He is actively opposing.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:13.600]   Imagine how much time and effort that we put into our life so that we can be better.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:18.600]   How much time and effort and energy and emotions and thoughts and finances
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:23.600]   go into making our life better in the next stage in this life?
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:30.600]   And then yet God says, "If you are actively seeking to promote yourself,
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.600]   God is actively working against you."
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.600]   Isn't that a scary thought?
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:41.600]   So much of what we do is following the pattern of this world so that we can get
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.600]   to the next stage, so that our children can get to the next stage,
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:52.600]   and then yet God says, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.600]   Remember when people were following around saying, "We want to be disciples"?
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   Remember what Jesus said?
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.600]   "If you want to follow after me, deny yourself.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:08.600]   Pick up your cross and follow me because before I go to glory, I go to the cross,
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.600]   and you must also go to the cross."
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:17.600]   So Christian sanctification is not bettering ourselves so that we can be masters
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.600]   at Scripture and putting more time in prayer, and all of these things are things
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.600]   that the Bible commands us to do.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:30.600]   But the primary call of a Christian sanctification is to become less,
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:37.600]   to die, so that after we have done the work, nobody recognizes who you are.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.600]   Just like John the Baptist.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.600]   He gave his whole life to prepare for Christ, and as soon as Christ shows up,
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:48.600]   he says, "He must increase, I must decrease," and he's never heard again.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.600]   All we know about John the Baptist is that he was kind of eccentric.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.600]   He was out in the desert.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.600]   He ate some locusts, had some weird clothes.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.600]   He said things that Jesus was going to say.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   He did things that Jesus would do, and then as soon as he showed up,
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.600]   he disappeared.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.600]   There's no monument for him.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:12.600]   There's no record of what he did, his genealogy.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:18.600]   Only thing we know of him was that he prepared for Christ's coming.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.600]   You and I have been called for the same thing.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.600]   It's not about you.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.600]   It's not about me.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:34.600]   If I die and nobody remembers me, but they know the Christ that I loved,
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.600]   then I've been faithful.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:41.600]   But if I pass and you talk about me for generations,
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:47.600]   then maybe I worked a little bit too hard to leave my legacy.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.600]   God didn't call me for that, and he didn't call you for that.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:57.600]   C.S. Lewis says, "As long as you are proud, you cannot know God."
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:01.600]   A proud man is always looking down on things and people.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.600]   And, of course, as long as you are looking down,
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:07.600]   you cannot see sometimes that is above you.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   A proud man always looks down,
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.600]   always looks at things that are not up to your par.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.600]   So you cannot know God because you're always looking down.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:22.600]   1 Peter 5:6 says, "Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God,
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.600]   and he may exalt you at the proper time."
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   We have a habit of honoring the proud and dismissing the humble.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:36.600]   You know, some of the most challenging testimonies I've ever heard
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:41.600]   are people who had nothing, from uneducated people.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:46.600]   I mean, you talk about the faith of these men in the villages,
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:50.600]   some of them can barely read and write.
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.600]   They don't know--they've never read systematic theology.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.600]   They weren't properly trained in how to make disciples
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.600]   and how to multiply your church.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.600]   They've never been--they came, heard the gospels,
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.600]   "I believe this. Forgive me of my sins."
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.600]   And then they just took that simple message
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.600]   and just started following the other pastors.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.600]   And even in the midst of persecution and trouble,
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.600]   they campaigned to support their kids.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:19.600]   Because of their faith, their kids can't even go to school.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:23.600]   And yet their faith is so much more powerful
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:27.600]   than even our celebrity pastors in our culture.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.600]   Why are they more powerful? Why are they bearing more fruit?
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:34.600]   Why are they so much more courageous?
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.600]   Because they know Christ.
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:39.600]   I remember years of being out in the streets
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:44.600]   working with the homeless, and this guy that I met,
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.600]   he was out in the streets temporarily.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.600]   If you met him, you wouldn't know that he was homeless.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.600]   But we would set up and feed, and he would sit down,
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.600]   and I got to know him a little bit.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.600]   And basically what happened was he was part of a gang,
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.600]   and he was selling drugs, and he was coming in and out of prison constantly.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.600]   And so his family got fed up with him.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.600]   And so by the time--last time he went,
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.600]   his family said, "I don't want anything to do with him.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.600]   You go figure out your life."
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.600]   So by the time he came out of prison, after about six months,
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.600]   there was nobody there to catch him.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.600]   So he was out in the streets temporarily
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.600]   until he found some government funding
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.600]   and trying to get a job and to save up enough money
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.600]   to get back on his feet.
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.600]   And it was during that short period of time that I met him.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.600]   I remember one particular Tuesday, he came,
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.600]   and he was always a joyful guy,
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:32.600]   but then this particular Tuesday, I mean, he was beaming.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.600]   And he said, "Peter, God is so good."
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.600]   I said, "What happened?"
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.600]   He said, "You know, on the way here, I got robbed."
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:44.600]   I said, "Okay, so you got robbed. What happened?"
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.600]   He said, "I got robbed.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.600]   Some drug addicts came and wanted something,
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.600]   and I had nothing in my pocket, and they didn't believe me.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.600]   And so I started walking away, and they didn't believe me,
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.600]   so they chased me down, and they took a bottle,
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.600]   and they smashed it over his head."
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.600]   So I said, "Okay, you're kind of crazy.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.600]   Are you back on drugs? What does this mean?"
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.600]   He said, "Look at my head."
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.600]   So I said, "What do you see?"
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.600]   And I said, "Nothing. You're bald.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.600]   Outside of that, what do you want me to see?"
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.600]   He said, "Do you see anything?"
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.600]   He said, "No, I don't see anything."
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:24.600]   He said, "There's no mark. I didn't get cut.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:28.600]   That guy broke a bottle over my head, and I didn't get cut."
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:32.600]   He said, "Praise God, because he protected me.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.600]   Even in the midst of a broken bottle over my head,
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.600]   he protected me."
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.600]   He understands the grace of God.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.600]   You know, a man who's been broken to the point,
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.600]   who's humble to the point, has nothing to be proud,
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.600]   and he knew God's love and grace to the point
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.600]   that even being robbed and having a broken bottle over his head
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.600]   was a cause of praise to God.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.600]   Think how easily we get thwarted by worship,
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.600]   worshiping God.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.600]   Bad traffic.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.600]   Somebody said something mean to you.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   They didn't remember your birthday.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.600]   You didn't get the promotion that you wanted.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   Think how easily we get sidetracked.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.600]   It's like, "I have a hard time worshiping God because of this."
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:29.600]   Yet a man who is humble and understands what he has in Christ
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.600]   could not take him off of worship.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.600]   A humble man.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.600]   God is looking for humble people to exalt.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.600]   Humble people to exalt.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.600]   There's a reason why Ephesians 2:8 and 9 says,
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.600]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith that is not of yourselves,
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.600]   but is a gift of God, so that no one may boast."
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.600]   Christianity and boasting is a contradiction
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.600]   because the core of Christianity is to say we could not and He did.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:02.600]   So how can a man who praises and worships and memorizes
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.600]   that He gave me something I didn't deserve,
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.600]   I deserve wrath, but He gave me love,
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:14.600]   how can the core of Christianity teach that and be proud at the same time?
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:17.600]   He said, "He saved us by grace so that no one may boast."
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:23.600]   How boasting ruins everything.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:29.600]   You ever see a man who is trying so hard to be recognized?
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:36.600]   My achievements, what I have done, churches I planted, people I've discipled.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.600]   You ever see a man that does that?
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:44.600]   If you've been watching the news, you've probably seen it yourself.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.600]   Whenever you see somebody do that in a large scale or small scale,
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.600]   what's the first response?
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:58.600]   The first response that you'll see is everybody trying hard to knock him off that pedestal.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.600]   That's our first response.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:02.600]   That's not a certain type of people do that.
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.600]   Everybody, if somebody comes into the room,
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:10.600]   "Do you know who I am?" "Yeah, I know who you are, you're a jerk."
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.600]   He who is humble, God exalts.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:17.600]   He who exalts himself, God opposes.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:21.600]   You know, there's a story about this rooster, right?
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:22.600]   It's not in the Bible.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.600]   So don't wake up now and say, "Abbas and Peter's quoting weird things."
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.600]   It's not in the Bible.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.600]   There's a story about this rooster.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:39.600]   All his life he's crowing, and he has convinced himself that the sun rises because of him.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.600]   Every morning that's what happens.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.600]   He crows and the sun rises.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.600]   Well, one day there's a massive disaster coming in,
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:50.600]   and so the eagles decided to have mercy on these farm animals,
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.600]   and he swoops down and he tells them, "You're going to have to grab onto me,
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.600]   and I'm going to take you out to safety."
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.600]   So the small animals are attached, because obviously they can't do that with their little legs.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.600]   They don't have fingers, right?
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.600]   So he said, "You're going to have to bite my wings,
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:12.600]   and then I'm going to lift you up, and I'm going to start taking you to safety."
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.600]   So all the little animals come, and they cling on to him,
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.600]   and the crow comes, and he bites onto the eagle,
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.600]   and the eagle starts flying, taking them out.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.600]   And as he is flying, and they're headed toward safety, high up in the sky,
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.600]   the eagle recognizes the sun coming up.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.600]   And so the other eagles are like, "Wow, the magnificence of the sun.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.600]   This is so awesome.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.600]   Who has done this?
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:44.600]   Day after day, this beauty of the glory of the sun being raised.
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.600]   Who has done this?"
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:52.600]   And the crow, with his mouth clenched to the eagle for survival,
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:55.600]   is thinking to himself, "I did it! I did it!"
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:01.600]   But he can't say anything, because the moment he says it, he's going to fall.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.600]   And as the time goes, they just can't--it overwhelms them.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.600]   The glory of the sun.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.600]   And the crow just finally couldn't stand it anymore,
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:14.600]   and it started to say, "I did it!"
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.600]   as it started falling to its death.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.600]   True story.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:27.600]   It's something that I heard when I was a little kid that I remembered.
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:35.600]   How much of human life is captured in that silly story?
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:41.600]   We try so hard to become somebody, sometimes even in the church,
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:51.600]   when God has been telling us, history after history,
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.600]   passage after passage, example after example,
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:03.600]   that your goal is to become less, not more.
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:09.600]   To become a nobody, so that He can become a somebody.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:14.600]   So that when He comes in glory, that we wait for our glory when He comes in glory.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:17.600]   How much of our trouble, how much of our anxiety,
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.600]   how much of our divisions stem from this?
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.600]   How much of our marriage problems,
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.600]   how much of our difficulty with children stem from this?
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:30.600]   That we have not given up on our ambitions.
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:33.600]   We have not given up on our exaltation.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:40.600]   And as a result, we have become impotent in the things of God.
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:46.600]   God is looking for humble people that He may be exalted.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.600]   Let me conclude with this.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:54.600]   In the years that we've been here at Berean,
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:59.600]   there's one lesson that I've learned like almost a punch in the face.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:05.600]   You know, I started out ministry at 19, 20, and I started speaking.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:08.600]   I spoke outside the church way more than I do now.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:15.600]   Part of the reason why I asked my wife Esther to change from being a pharmacist
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.600]   to a schoolteacher is because pharmacists have to work year-round.
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.600]   So my thought was, and again, as a young pastor thinking like,
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.600]   and since I'm going and traveling so much, I asked her,
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.600]   it's like if you become a schoolteacher, you know,
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.600]   you get off school a little bit earlier and you have the whole summer off,
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.600]   so maybe you can come with me.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.600]   And then eventually, maybe if you don't have to work, you don't have to work.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:39.600]   But that was my thinking, right, at that perspective.
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.600]   And so I experienced, you know, what you would call,
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:46.600]   humanly speaking, superficial fruit early.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.600]   Because I was speaking a lot and I was going to places, you know,
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.600]   and I had a lot of friends.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.600]   And then I got punched in the face.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.600]   I just got burned out.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.600]   The fruit didn't turn out the way I wanted it to turn out.
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.600]   All the sacrifices, labor that I felt like I was putting in,
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.600]   it just wasn't producing what I wanted.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:13.600]   And I started thinking, like, am I going to have the same life that my parents lived?
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.600]   The very thing that I couldn't stand, like I don't want to do this.
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.600]   But it started to look like that.
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.600]   And so when this church first got started, I had no vision.
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.600]   I've already been disappointed.
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.600]   I had no expectation.
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.600]   Just a few of the kids, I mean, there were kids at that time,
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:34.600]   like I'm just going to be faithful and try to take care of them.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:37.600]   And the church didn't grow.
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.600]   Not to my surprise, it wasn't a big surprise because at that time the
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.600]   Seeker Friendly Movement was just taking off.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.600]   And so every church was like their mega churches are popping up left and right.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.600]   It's like, oh, 5,000, 10,000.
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:54.600]   And so I remember during that period my friends who were, you know,
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.600]   I went to their churches to speak.
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.600]   All of a sudden, Peter, why are you doing that?
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:01.600]   You can go to this large church and you can do this.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.600]   You're just so stubborn.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:07.600]   Why are you committing to these few kids?
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.600]   And at that time it wasn't anything noble.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:10.600]   It was just I had no vision for that.
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.600]   I was already burned out by that.
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:15.600]   And I just wanted it like -- I thought it would be noble even if it's just
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:19.600]   10 of them to commit to them and at least it's worthwhile.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.600]   And I don't know if I'm going to keep doing this,
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.600]   but I'm just going to do that for the time being.
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:29.600]   I remember during that period every friend, every mentor that I knew said,
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.600]   "Peter, stop being stubborn.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.600]   You're just stubborn.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.600]   You're so stubborn."
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:37.600]   I've heard that so many times I know that for a fact.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.600]   I'm pretty stubborn.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.600]   If I'm convicted about something, like I will not move.
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:45.600]   You have to show me why I need to move, but I'm not going to move just because
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:48.600]   you said it because, you know, I've heard it enough.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.600]   No amount of pressure you're going to put on me is going to get me to change
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.600]   me unless I actually see it.
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:56.600]   But then all of a sudden, again, you know, make a long story short,
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:00.600]   at some point, six, seven years down the line the church started actually
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.600]   growing.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:05.600]   You know, what's really interesting was during that period when the church
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.600]   wasn't growing I started reading a lot of books about church growth and, like,
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.600]   how to do church because I don't know how to do church.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:13.600]   I was just -- I know how to preach, right, and I know how to, like,
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.600]   do discipleship, but I don't know how to run a church.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.600]   And I remember reading this book about church growth, and in that book it says,
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:23.600]   "If you plant the church and it doesn't grow in the first two years,
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.600]   99.9% that church will fail."
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:31.600]   And I read that about five years into the church.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:35.600]   So basically he said, "Wrap it up, right?
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.600]   You fail.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:37.600]   Stop being stubborn."
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:40.600]   Now, if I started with a vision for a large church,
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.600]   that would have been it, right?
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:48.600]   But I had no vision to begin with, so it didn't really bother me that much.
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.600]   But I've accepted that's the way it's going to be, you know,
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.600]   and this is what I'm going to do.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:56.600]   And then when the church started growing, all of a sudden the same people were
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.600]   asking me, "Peter, what are you doing?
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.600]   What are you doing?
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.600]   How are you preaching?
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.600]   How is your Bible study organized?
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:06.600]   What does your small group look like?
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:07.600]   You have big donors in the church."
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.600]   I mean, they started asking me all these questions, and my answer to them is,
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.600]   "Nothing.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.600]   Everything that you were telling me about not being stubborn the first five,
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.600]   six years is the exact same thing that we're doing."
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:23.600]   And they would just walk away and say, "Peter doesn't want to share."
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.600]   But honestly, that's my honest thing.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.600]   Nothing has changed.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.600]   It's just that God saw fit early on to keep us that way,
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.600]   and God saw fit at the second part.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:40.600]   And if there's one thing that I learned, and I'm still learning,
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.600]   God is not seeking my glory.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.600]   God is not seeking my glory.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.600]   God is seeking his glory.
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:54.600]   So the worst thing that I can do is to get in the way, to get the credit.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:20:00.600]   And once I do that, then I have a God who is actively opposing me.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.600]   So if I want God to be exalted, I got to get out of the way.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:06.600]   I have to become less.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.600]   That's the one lesson that I've learned over the years, over and over again,
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:16.600]   that if somebody meets Christ, that they meet Christ, not me,
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:23.600]   not the leaders, not the organization, not the elders, not the pastors,
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.600]   that you come and meet Christ.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.600]   And then if I die and you don't remember me, but you love Christ,
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:33.600]   then I've done what I've been called to do, to introduce you to Christ.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:37.600]   I don't want you examining my life.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:41.600]   I don't want you -- I don't want, after I die, examining my life and say,
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.600]   "Oh, what was Pastor Peter like at his home?
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:46.600]   What was he like?" I don't want you examining my life.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:50.600]   I don't want you examining my grammar.
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:56.600]   You know how many people tell me how bad my English is?
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:02.600]   I admit I'm a partial fop, and I embrace it with all my heart.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:05.600]   I don't want you examining my life.
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:10.600]   My life is not worth examining.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:15.600]   I'm a man who's broken by the grace of God.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:21.600]   I struggle like everybody else to want some of that.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:27.600]   But if you look at me carefully, you're not going to celebrate me
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:30.600]   because I don't want you looking at me closely.
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:37.600]   I want you to look through me to see the Christ who saved me.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:41.600]   Our biggest struggle is that our fallenness,
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.600]   wanting to be at the center and on a pedestal.
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.600]   We bring it into the church.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.600]   We bring it into our preaching.
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.600]   We bring it into everything that we do,
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:56.600]   not realizing that that is what's causing God to oppose us.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:59.600]   Mary was not chosen despite her humility.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:03.600]   Mary was chosen because of her humble circumstance.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.600]   Let me give you seven quick things as a wrap-up.
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.600]   What humbleness looks like in people.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:12.600]   One, humble people are thankful people
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.600]   because they know they didn't do anything.
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.600]   Because Christ did it, their heart is always thankful,
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.600]   which leads to praise.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:22.600]   Two, they are eager to listen more than to speak.
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.600]   A proud person wants to teach everybody.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.600]   I got something to say.
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.600]   But as soon as other people have something to say,
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.600]   they're kind of wandering off.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:36.600]   A humble person is eager to listen more than to speak.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.600]   Again, there's nobody who qualifies 100% with this.
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.600]   These are things that we all struggle with.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.600]   Three, they're more quick to forgive
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:48.600]   because you and I stand because we're forgiven.
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.600]   But you offend a proud man,
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.600]   as soon as the conversation is over,
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:54.600]   he's sharpening his knife.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:57.600]   How dare you speak to me that way?
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.600]   How dare you?
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.600]   But a humble man is eager to forgive
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.600]   because he's been forgiven.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:05.600]   A humble man is teachable.
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.600]   He's like, "Oh, I can't.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.600]   I got a PhD in this, and I can't learn from that guy.
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:10.600]   What does he know?"
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:15.600]   A humble man can learn from a child
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.600]   because he's teachable.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:20.600]   Anything that reflects Christ, you can learn from.
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:21.600]   They don't have to be PhDs.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:22.600]   They don't have to be pastors.
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:25.600]   You can learn from your own children
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:28.600]   when God has reflected off of them.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.600]   Humble people build others up
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.600]   because they know what they have,
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.600]   they don't deserve it.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.600]   So they're eager to build other people up.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.600]   Humble people are servants
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.600]   who are eager to serve
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:45.600]   because they're thankful of what they have.
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.600]   So they naturally become worshipers,
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.600]   and worshipers naturally end up serving.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:51.600]   And then finally,
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.600]   humble people rest in the sovereignty of God.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.600]   We're not easily shaken.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.600]   When we embrace our humility
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.600]   that Christ has exalted,
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:03.600]   we're not easily shaken
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.600]   because we're never in control to begin with.
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.600]   So when things go out of whack,
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:10.600]   it's like, "Oh my gosh, things are out of whack."
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:11.600]   No, it's never out of whack
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.600]   because we were never in control to begin with.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:18.600]   God saved us from something we could not control,
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.600]   and our rest and peace
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:23.600]   rests upon His sovereignty and not ours.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.600]   And all of these things
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.600]   are ultimately what produces life.
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.600]   So God calls us, one, to believe,
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.600]   and then to empty ourselves,
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.600]   that He may be exalted.
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:38.600]   Let's pray.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:47.600]   Heavenly Father,
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.600]   we come to You in our weakness,
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.600]   in our brokenness,
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:58.600]   in our weariness,
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.600]   and at times distracted,
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.600]   filled with pride,
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.600]   filled with coveting,
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:11.600]   desiring to be recognized,
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:16.600]   actively pursuing to retaliate.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.600]   Lord, we believe.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:22.600]   Help our unbelief,
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:25.600]   that we may take to heart, Lord God,
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.600]   how You have humbled the proud
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:33.600]   and how You have blessed the humble,
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:37.600]   that we may pursue a life of emptiness,
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:42.600]   that we may embrace the humility of Christ,
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:46.600]   that in our humility that we may exalt Him
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:49.600]   and Him alone.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.600]   Thank You, Father, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.600]   Why don't we all stand up for the closing praise?
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:15.600]   O nail me down again
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:21.600]   here at Your feet
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:27.600]   Show me how much You love
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:33.600]   humility
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:39.600]   O Spirit be the star
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:44.600]   that leads me to
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.600]   the humble heart
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:56.600]   that I see in You
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:04.600]   You are the God of the broken
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:08.600]   a friend of the lame
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:15.600]   You wash the feet of the weary
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:20.600]   embrace the ones in need
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:27.600]   I want to be like You, Jesus
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:32.600]   to have this heart in me
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:38.600]   You are the God of the humble
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:46.600]   You are the humble King
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:52.600]   O nail me down again
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:58.600]   here at Your feet
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:03.600]   Show me how much You love
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:09.600]   humility
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:15.600]   O Spirit be the star
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:21.600]   that leads me to
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.600]   the humble heart
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:33.600]   that I see in You
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:40.600]   You are the God of the broken
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:45.600]   a friend of the lame
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:52.600]   You wash the feet of the weary
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:57.600]   embrace the ones in need
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:04.600]   I want to be like You, Jesus
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.600]   to have this heart in me
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:15.600]   You are the God of the humble
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.600]   You are the humble King
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:27.600]   You are the God of the humble
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:33.600]   You are the humble King
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:38.600]   Let's pray.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:43.600]   May the Lord bless you and keep you
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:47.600]   and make His face shine upon you
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.600]   that Christ and what He has done
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.600]   may be exalted wherever He sends us.
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.600]   Amen.
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:00.600]   God sent His Son
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:05.600]   They called Him Jesus
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:10.600]   He came to love
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:14.600]   He went forth again
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:19.600]   He lived in time
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:24.600]   to buy my heart
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:29.600]   An empty grave is there to fill
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:33.600]   a Savior there
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:38.600]   Because He lived
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.600]   I can face tomorrow
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:47.600]   Because He lived
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:52.600]   All fear is gone
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:56.600]   Because I know
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:01.600]   He holds the future
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:05.600]   And life is worth the living
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:12.600]   Just because He lives
