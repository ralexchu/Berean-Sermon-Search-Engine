[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:59.880]   - Good morning.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.880]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.880]   Let me get to a few announcements
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.880]   before we get started.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.880]   First of all, this week on Friday,
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.880]   we have a praising prayer night again
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.880]   that we do monthly.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.880]   Again, I want to encourage all of you
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   to do your best to come out to that
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.880]   because, again, this is not just so that
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.880]   we can say that we have this prayer time,
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.880]   but our theme for this year is to watch and pray.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.880]   And so each year when we evaluate
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.880]   what are some of the weaknesses
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.880]   that we need to pay attention to
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.880]   so that we can become stronger.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.880]   And so this is one of those areas
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   that we really want to grow as a church together.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.880]   And so not just individually pray,
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   but to pray corporately.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.880]   And so that's why we've designated
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.880]   once a month to be able to gather together
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.880]   to do this.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.880]   So if, again, we strongly encourage
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.880]   all the members, and even if you're not a member,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.880]   to come and pray with us corporately.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.880]   And so that's happening this Friday at 7.30
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.880]   in this room, and also the chairs
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.880]   will be set up outside as well.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.880]   For the BCC Service Auction for India fundraiser,
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.880]   if you have services,
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.880]   so it doesn't have to be anything specific.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.880]   If you want to help babysit,
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.880]   and I heard that some of the moms
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.880]   are actually gathering together
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.880]   and doing a little mini camp for children,
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.880]   and that will be serviced off.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.880]   And so you can be kind of creative
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.880]   in what you offer,
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.880]   whether it's just coming home
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.880]   and pulling weed for somebody else.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.880]   Last time we had camping trips that were offered
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.880]   and raised a ton of money doing that.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   And so you can just be kind of creative.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880]   If you want to participate and help out
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.880]   with the fundraising for what's happening in India,
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   you can contact them and let them know
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.880]   what you are offering,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.880]   and then that will go on the auction page
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.880]   specifically when that happens.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.880]   So they're taking sign-ups for that until the 31st.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.880]   So it could be a service,
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.880]   or it can be a product that you want to donate
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880]   that can be auctioned off.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.880]   And again, all the proceeds will be going
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.880]   to the ministry that were participating in India.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.880]   Also for the All Church Retreat that's happening,
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.880]   the registration is open now,
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.880]   so we want to encourage you.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.880]   We haven't been able to do that in a while,
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.880]   and so we're going to take all the precautions needed
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.880]   when we are told, when we get closer to that time.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.880]   And so we want you --
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.880]   we encourage you to sign up as early as possible
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   so that I think this year around,
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.880]   the room assignments and small groups
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.880]   is going to take extra work for us to do
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.880]   because of all the stuff that's been going on.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.880]   So if you guys are planning to come,
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.880]   please sign up for that as soon as you can.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.880]   And so the sign-ups for that are open.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.880]   And then one last thing is, as you guys know,
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.880]   and I put up on our members page
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.880]   that Pastor Isaac has passed away from COVID.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.880]   So those of you who've been with us to India,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.880]   you've met him.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.880]   He was the oldest son of the three pastors
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.880]   that we work with,
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.880]   and he was the one who was going to take over
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.880]   that ministry when the father passes away.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.880]   And the father is not in good health,
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.880]   and so they were kind of grooming him to take over.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.880]   And so we got notice on Wednesday
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.880]   that he was taken to the hospital,
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   and then on Friday morning, he passed away from it.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.880]   And so obviously they're grieving,
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.880]   but at the same time, the need to fill that gap,
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.880]   they're scrambling as they're taking care
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.880]   of funeral arrangements.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.880]   So if you guys can keep them in your prayers.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.880]   So especially the people who are in the village areas,
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.880]   I'm sure you've been reading up on what's going on,
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.880]   but they don't have access to medical attention.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.880]   So usually when they get to the hospital,
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.880]   it's because it's kind of run its full course.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   And so they don't have access to treatments
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.880]   and stuff like that.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.880]   And so we don't know exactly what's going on over there,
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.880]   but it seems like it is up to recently,
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   I've heard very little about it,
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.880]   but within the last two to three weeks,
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.880]   I'm hearing more and more from the pastors
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.880]   that there is a tangible effect of not only for the pastors,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.880]   but the villagers, the Christians who they're dealing with.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.880]   So if you guys can please continue to keep them
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.880]   in your prayers, and all the funds that are raised for that
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   is going to go to support our pastors who are out there.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   Also for the golf tournament,
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   I think the registration is closed,
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.880]   but that's going to be taking place on this Saturday
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.880]   for the raising of funds for our IMB missions.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.880]   All right, so after I pray,
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.880]   we'll give you an opportunity to give your offering online
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.880]   or the physical offering in the back box over there.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   We're going to have our brother Tyler Wong come up,
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.880]   and he's going to give his testimony
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.880]   and be baptized this morning.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.880]   All right, let's pray.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.880]   Lord, we lift up our brothers and sisters, Lord,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.880]   out in India to you.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.880]   We pray, Father God, for your grace and your mercy
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.880]   to be heavy upon them, that as they grieve or they're sad,
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.880]   that as wickedness increases, that our love would not grow cold,
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   but rather that we would experience greater revival,
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.880]   greater sense of urgency to spread your word.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.880]   So we pray that even this morning as we come to worship you,
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.880]   that you would search us and know us
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.880]   and see if there's any hurtful ways in us,
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.880]   that all that we give to you may be a pleasing sacrifice.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   I pray that the offering that we give may be multiplied,
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.880]   30, 60, 100-fold, that your glory, your gospel,
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.880]   may reach the remotest part of the world.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.900]   Hi, everyone.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:50.900]   My name is Tyler.
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.900]   I'm a second-year student in the College Ministry,
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:58.900]   Casa de Long Beach, and this is my testimony.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.900]   Growing up, I was born and raised in a Christian household
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.900]   and was blessed with the opportunity to hear and learn about God at such a young age.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.900]   I served in the church, went to Sunday school,
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.900]   and checked off all the boxes on the outside on what it looked like to be a Christian.
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.900]   But in reality, I had no desire to know God,
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.900]   and I lived a life with my own selfish desires,
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:25.900]   especially when I wasn't at church on Sunday mornings or Friday night youth groups.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:31.900]   My focus was on worldly things with people that I don't even know remember who I am today.
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:38.900]   I was a people pleaser and did whatever it took to make it seem like I fit in with the rest of my peers.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:43.900]   This would cause me to live a life for myself and live a life full of lies.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:49.900]   This life full of sin caused me to never be able to see what the Lord had desired for me.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.900]   Throughout this whole time, I attended church without a heart for the Lord,
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.900]   even though I said and did the things to make it seem like I did.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.900]   I had a lot of head knowledge of who God was through Sunday school, Bible stories,
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.900]   but did nothing to apply it to my own life personally.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.900]   I did this for my whole life heading into high school,
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.900]   and at this time, transitioning into high school was really tough for me
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.900]   as I went to a small high school where none of my peers from middle school went to,
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.900]   and I felt like I had no friends there.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:27.900]   That whole year, I felt lonely and felt like my life was purposeless at the time.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.900]   I would come home every day from school, lock myself in my room,
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.900]   and lock out God and the rest of the people in my life away from me.
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.900]   I had no confidence in myself for at least the first half of my freshman year,
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.900]   and I even considered ending it all.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:48.900]   During this time of loneliness, I felt God's comfort and the love from the witnesses in my life
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.900]   that never gave up on me and cared about me deeply.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.900]   I was overwhelmed by his love, and one night I cried out to the Lord in prayer,
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:00.900]   realizing that I wanted and needed him in my life.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.900]   The Lord pulled me up from the depths of my sin,
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:09.900]   and it is only by his grace that he opened my eyes to see him for who he truly is.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:14.900]   My eyes were opened, and in December of 2016, I was sprinkled at my home church.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.900]   Even after this event, I continued to struggle with sin and my obedience to the Lord
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.900]   as I tried to hold on to sin with one hand and God with the other.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.900]   I continued to try and live a life as my peers did the rest of high school,
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.900]   and those influences transformed my heart to be hardened
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.900]   and unable to fully surrender myself to the Lord.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.900]   The summer of senior year heading into college, I realized that I needed to let go
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.900]   and fully surrender myself to the Lord
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:46.900]   and really sacrifice everything in my life that I truly idolized and desired, and so I did.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.900]   Ever since then, throughout the trials and tribulations,
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.900]   the Lord continues to work in my life to shape me into the person he calls for me to be.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:59.900]   Luke 6:46 says, "Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?"
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.900]   Today, as an act of obedience, I am getting baptized so that I may be raised
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.900]   with Christ in his death and resurrection.
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:12.900]   Romans 8:28 says, "And we know that God causes all things to work for good,
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.900]   to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose."
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.900]   The Lord continues to provide for me in times of uncertainty
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.900]   and has blessed me beyond what I could ask for.
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.900]   God is good, and I realize that sometimes that good isn't always what I want,
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.900]   but it's what I need in my life, and I need God.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.900]   Christ is Lord over my life no matter what happens,
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.900]   and I will continue to live a life for him in full obedience
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.900]   and I will surrender it to Jesus who is Lord over my life.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.900]   Thank you.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.900]   [applause]
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.900]   [laughter]
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:25.900]   [applause]
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.900]   [applause]
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:38.900]   Thank you, Tyler, for your testimony.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.900]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews 12, verses 1, 2, and 3,
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.900]   and today will be the final message on these three verses.
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.900]   Okay? I promise.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.900]   Hebrews 12, verses 1, 2, and 3.
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.900]   [pause]
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:09.900]   Reading out of the NASB, it says,
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.900]   "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us,
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.900]   let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us.
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.900]   Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.900]   fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.900]   who for the joy set before him endured the cross,
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.900]   despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.900]   For consider him who has endured such hostility by sinners against himself,
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.900]   so that you will not grow weary and lose heart."
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.900]   Let's pray.
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.900]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would open our eyes,
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.900]   that we may see what you have ordained in your word, Lord God,
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.900]   to sanctify and strengthen your church.
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.900]   Lord, if any of us has been drifting,
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.900]   we've allowed our hearts to be hardened, Lord God, toward the things that you give us.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.900]   Help us, Lord, to continue to be softened by your Holy Spirit and your word.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.900]   We pray that you would anoint this time, and let your voice be heard,
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.900]   that your children will hear it and follow you and you alone.
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.900]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:17.900]   I don't know how many of you are active on Instagram or Facebook,
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.900]   but I told people that I regularly stalk you.
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:27.900]   It helps me with the church, especially it's growing.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.900]   If I'm not your Facebook friend, please make me your Facebook friend.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.900]   Don't make me beg.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.900]   Friend me so I can connect, and that way I can know what's going on in your life.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:45.900]   I observe that based upon what you put on your Facebook page or your Instagram,
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.900]   what you love.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.900]   Usually you'll highlight certain things that you love and you care about,
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.900]   and you put it on your Instagram.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.900]   I'm not saying that that happens with everybody,
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.900]   but I can tell from a distance that some of you are foodies.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.900]   All you have, you have no pictures of human beings on your Instagram.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.900]   Like zero. Not even yourself.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.900]   All I see is the years and years of where you've eaten and just delicious food,
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.900]   the best presentations.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.900]   I can tell without you saying a word that you are a foodie,
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.900]   that you are willing to drive far distances to get the right food.
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.900]   Some of you are travel maniacs,
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.900]   because all I see on your Instagram pictures are the various places that you visited,
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.900]   and certain places are beautiful.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.900]   It makes me want to go there one day.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.900]   I can tell that you enjoy traveling just by what I see.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.900]   Some of you put up pictures of your friends.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.900]   Whenever you meet together with somebody, you'll take a selfie,
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.900]   and then you'll put it on the Instagram.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.900]   I see various pictures of who you've had meals with.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:53.900]   I know some of you who never post anything on Instagram or Facebook
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.900]   until you have your child.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.900]   There's no pictures of you. You don't interact at all.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:02.900]   Then all of a sudden, you become hyperactive as soon as you have a child,
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.900]   and all the pictures that are on there are usually of your children.
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.900]   Like, "Look at the spaghetti on his head."
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.900]   "Oh, he uses his left hand to cook," or whatever.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.900]   So everything that they do is exciting.
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.900]   So your Instagram and Facebook presentation kind of reveals
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.900]   that these are things that you care about.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.900]   Whatever it is that we care about,
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.900]   we have a tendency to be willing to suffer many things to do that.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.900]   Some of you might like traveling, visiting new places, but you may hate airplanes.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.900]   That's kind of like me.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.900]   I enjoy seeing new things and going to new places and seeing things,
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.900]   but that process of getting there is torture.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.900]   I hate being on an airplane. I have a bad back,
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.900]   and so I literally have to suffer through all that to get to the other end.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.900]   But the experience that you'll have on the other end is worth it.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.900]   So if you're a foodie, you may not like driving,
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.900]   and you may not like LA traffic,
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.900]   but you're willing to go through all of that because you want to get there.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.900]   So depending on what you love and how intensely you love something,
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:09.900]   you're probably more willing to put up with inconvenience and trials
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.900]   to get what you want.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:17.900]   Well, I say all of this because the motivation behind what Jesus did
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.900]   is clearly spelled out in this passage where it says,
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.900]   "Fixing our eyes on you, the author and perfecter of faith,
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:28.900]   who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despising the shame."
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.900]   You know, previously we looked about how Jesus was going to the cross,
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.900]   and he says, "It's time for me to be glorified,
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.900]   that I may glorify you, that you may glorify me."
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.900]   So to think of the cross, knowing what it is,
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.900]   and the term "glory" and the cross really don't fit together,
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:48.900]   but Christ used the cross to glorify himself, to glorify the Father.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.900]   But this term here where it says "joy" and the cross
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.900]   is another term that's an oxymoron.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.900]   You would never think that these two terms would be associated with the cross
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:02.900]   because it was human depravity that they came up with this,
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:06.900]   this creative idea to humiliate somebody,
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.900]   not only to carry out the punishment, but as an example
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.900]   so that nobody would want to commit that same crime.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:22.900]   And yet, the Bible says the cross was a place where God and the Father was glorified,
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:27.900]   and then here it says he was able to endure the cross because of joy.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.900]   He did it because of joy.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:34.900]   But what was this joy that was big enough, great enough, deep enough
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.900]   that he was willing to endure the cross?
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:43.900]   So the more you love something, the more you are willing to put up with to have it.
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.900]   So the fact that he was willing to endure the cross
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.900]   signifies that the joy that was coming
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:54.900]   was much greater than whatever he was going to suffer.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.900]   But what was this joy?
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:02.900]   What was it that he had because of the cross that he didn't have before the cross?
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.900]   You may say, "Well, the Bible says that he was lifted up,
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.900]   he became the King of kings and Lord of lords."
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.900]   Well, he was that before the cross.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.900]   He was the second person of the Trinity.
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.900]   So he didn't need the cross to have glory.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.900]   Or say, "He sat down at the right hand of God."
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.900]   He's God.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.900]   He didn't need the cross to be sitting at the right hand of God.
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.900]   All the glory that you can think of that God had,
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.900]   he had before the cross.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:35.900]   So what was it that he was looking forward to, to enjoy,
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.900]   that even the shame and the suffering that was coming because of the cross,
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.900]   he was willing to endure?
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.900]   Now I remember the first time wrestling through this.
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.900]   I read this passage. I memorized this scripture, this part of it.
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.900]   And typically we kind of hone in on,
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.900]   we need to fix your eyes upon Jesus.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.900]   We need to endure, right?
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.900]   And then you hear a lot of sermons about not to be entangled with things
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.900]   that are encumbrances or sin that so easily clings to us.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.900]   And so you've probably heard a lot of messages on those things.
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:13.900]   But one particular day I was fixating on the joy that was said before him.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.900]   What is this joy that he's referring to?
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:20.900]   So I was combing through scripture and looking up commentaries,
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.900]   and I realized a clear thing that he was saying,
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.900]   that the joy that was said before him is referring to me and you.
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.900]   To me and you.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.900]   Everything else that you and I can think of as his exaltation,
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.900]   he had that, and then some.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.900]   But what he didn't have before the cross is us.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:44.900]   And the Bible describes how he came to restore that joy in us.
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.900]   In fact, Ephesians 1, 7-9 says,
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.900]   "We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses,
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.900]   according to the riches of his grace."
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.900]   His arms not being twisted.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.900]   God the Father didn't grab him by the throat and say, "You better do this."
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.900]   Sinners were not the ones who forced him on the cross.
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:09.900]   He volunteered, walked in, even as he was agonizing over the pain that was coming,
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.900]   he volunteered to lay down his life.
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:16.900]   And he says this laying down of his life was a lavishing of his love toward us.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.900]   According to his kind intentions which he purposed in him.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.900]   Ephesians 2, 4-5 says, "With God being rich in mercy,
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.900]   because of his great love with which he loved us,
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.900]   even when we were dead in our transgressions,
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.900]   made us alive together with Christ, by grace you have been saved."
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.900]   I think I've mentioned this enough in our sermons, in our Bible studies,
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:44.900]   and throughout the years, that you and I live in a generation where
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.900]   his love and mercy has been emphasized to the point
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:53.900]   where people have a very shallow understanding of his holiness and justice.
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:57.900]   It's almost kind of like a given, like, "Oh, come God, come God doesn't answer prayers.
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.900]   How come they don't do this for me?"
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.900]   People walk into brand new churches and say, "Oh, they didn't do this for me."
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:06.900]   So we have this entitlement when we come to God, "Why doesn't God do this for me?"
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.900]   Which is a very weird thing to ask.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.900]   Very weird thing to ask to come into the presence of God
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:17.900]   and think that God owes you something.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:21.900]   But because of the way that the gospel has been preached in our generation,
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.900]   an average person walks into church expecting God to love them,
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.900]   expecting God to be merciful.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.900]   So it's important for us to understand the balance that the cross
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:38.900]   is the perfect glorification of his justice and holiness along with his love.
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:45.900]   But having said that, as important as God's justice is, as important as his love is,
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:54.900]   if we stray from understanding that the love was the primary motivation of why he came,
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:37:02.900]   the damage that that does is equally harmful as emphasizing just the justice.
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.900]   He says the primary reason why he came is because he loved God so,
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.900]   and he loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.900]   So the gospel is a glorification of God's love toward us.
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:20.900]   He was willing to suffer the shame, the agony, the pain, the rejection, humiliation,
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:27.900]   all because there was joy waiting for him that this cross was going to produce.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:32.900]   We often think about the nation of Israel, and after we read the Old Testament,
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:41.900]   our primary emotions, our primary idea of the relationship between Israel and God is
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.900]   that God must be so frustrated with Israel.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.900]   He's putting up with them, like, "I want to crush you,
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:53.900]   but because I made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I just can't."
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:59.900]   So the picture that we have oftentimes is God is just about to strike,
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:04.900]   and right before he hammers them, he's like, "Grrr, I made that covenant.
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.900]   I made that covenant, and I can't deny myself."
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.900]   So he's just holding back.
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.900]   Well, that's not how his love for Israel is described.
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.900]   In Isaiah 62, verse 5, it says,
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.900]   "For as a young man marries a virgin, so your sons will marry you.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:26.900]   And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so your God will rejoice over you."
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.900]   I mean, he describes his love for the nation of Israel
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.900]   in the most intimate relationship between a young bride,
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.900]   in the honeymoon stage, where you just can't wait to get together.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:42.900]   He says the most intense love that we are able to experience,
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.900]   he says that's the way God loves his people.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.900]   Zechariah chapter 2, verse 8, it says,
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.900]   "For thus says the Lord of hosts,
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:53.900]   'After glory he has sent me against the nations which plunder you,
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.900]   but he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.'"
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.900]   You know that term, "the apple of his eye," actually comes from this text, right?
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:07.900]   And I remember trying to do research, and I Googled and asked professors,
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.900]   "What does this mean, 'apple of his eye'?"
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.900]   Well, the apple of your eye is the part of your eye,
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.900]   just basically the sensitive area in your eye,
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.900]   where all it is saying is,
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:23.900]   when somebody tries to come and touch you, what's your instinct?
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.900]   Your eyes don't get big like that, right?
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.900]   Instinctively, what happens?
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.900]   You close your eyes to protect your eyes, instinctively.
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.900]   So if I come over there, right, and I just go like that,
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.900]   and if I get too close, 100% of you,
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.900]   unless something's wrong with you,
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:46.900]   your natural instinctive response is to protect your eyes.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.900]   He's describing his love for the nation of Israel,
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.900]   that if anybody comes and touches you,
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.900]   it'll be like them touching the apple of my eye.
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.900]   Instinctively, without even thinking, without calculation,
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.900]   he's going to act to protect his people.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.900]   That's how he describes his love for the nation of Israel.
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:08.900]   Even as he pronounces judgment upon the nation of Israel,
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.900]   to discipline them because of their disobedience, he says, Isaiah 49, 15,
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.900]   "Can a woman forget her nursing child?"
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.900]   Of course, this is a rhetorical question.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.900]   He's not asking a question. He's like, "Can they?"
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.900]   Can they do that? No, he's saying, "Of course not."
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.900]   The most sacrificial love that he can describe
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.900]   is a young mom who is nursing her child,
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.900]   and can she have no compassion for the son of her womb?
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:35.900]   And obviously, the answer is a resounding, "No, of course not."
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.900]   Of course, a nursing mom can't forget her child.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.900]   Of course, she's going to have compassion on her.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:44.900]   But even these may forget, but I will not forget you.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.900]   That his love is even greater than that.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.900]   Even as he is pronouncing judgment, he says, "I will not."
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:55.900]   I cannot forget you because he loves them this much.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.900]   As Jesus is coming into Jerusalem,
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:04.900]   as Jesus is coming to Jerusalem, he recognizes that they're going to end up rejecting him.
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.900]   Even his disciples are going to run.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:11.900]   You would think that the natural response of Jesus would be,
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.900]   "I've done as much as I could."
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:18.900]   God was so angered with the nations
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.900]   that at one point he wiped them out in the flood, like Noah,
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.900]   during the time of Noah.
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.900]   But yet, he's coming into Jerusalem knowing that the very people
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.900]   that he's been patient with, that he loves, are going to reject him.
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.900]   His disciples are going to run.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.900]   And instead of being angered, he has compassion.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:40.900]   It says he was weeping over the nation of Israel,
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.900]   wanting them to turn.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.900]   You know, every part of Scripture, even though, even in his anger,
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.900]   it is an expression of God's love for us.
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.900]   Oftentimes we look at the book of Revelations and we say,
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:57.900]   "Wow, God is truly wrathful."
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.900]   A third of mankind dying because of disease.
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:05.900]   And you see these instances where you have the seal judgments,
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.900]   you have the trumpet judgments, and you have the bowl judgments,
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.900]   and every time a judgment comes, it gets more intense.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:14.900]   And you look at that and say, "Wow, God is truly wrathful."
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:19.900]   Revelation is not a revelation of the wrath of God.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:24.900]   Because the true wrath of God is not expressed in the Bible.
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:27.900]   All it says was, "The end shall come and you will be judged."
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:28.900]   The end.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.900]   That's where the true wrath is coming.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:34.900]   All that we see in the book of Revelation is a warning for sinners to turn.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:39.900]   Every bowl judgment, every trumpet judgment, every seal judgment,
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.900]   is God pleading with the sinful world to turn and to repent.
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:48.900]   If He was done with the nation, there is no drama of Revelation.
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:51.900]   There's no seal judgment, bowl judgment.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.900]   It was just, "I've had enough. You're crushed. The end."
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.900]   He just moves on.
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.900]   But even in His judgment, God is being patient,
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:04.900]   wanting sinners to repent and come to Him.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.900]   That's why the Bible says that when one sinner repents,
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.900]   all of heaven rejoices.
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.900]   And that's exactly what the Bible says,
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.900]   that He was willing to endure the excruciating pain,
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.900]   the humiliation, the rejection from His own people
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.900]   because of joy that He sees on the other side,
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.900]   meaning you and I.
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:29.900]   That we would be restored to what we lost.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.900]   Ephesians 1, 4-5, it says,
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:34.900]   "Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.900]   that we would be holy and blameless before Him,
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:41.900]   in love He predestined us to adoption."
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.900]   Whenever the term "predestination" comes,
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.900]   it always causes a stir in some people.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.900]   It's like, "Oh, this seems random.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.900]   He predestined, He elected.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:54.900]   Arbitrarily, He just chose some and He didn't choose the other."
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.900]   He says, "No, it was not arbitrary."
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.900]   He says, "In love He predestined us to adoption."
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:01.900]   In love.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.900]   Now, I can't explain to you how all of that works.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.900]   I can only tell you what it says.
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.900]   And what it says is,
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:11.900]   "Predestination is because of His love.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.900]   Election is motivated by His love.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.900]   He elected us, predestined us,
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.900]   as sons through Jesus Christ Himself
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:23.900]   according to the kind intention of His will."
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.900]   He didn't just forgive our sins.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.900]   In this pursuit of His own joy to save us,
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.900]   He didn't just say, "You know what?
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.900]   I'm going to prevent you from going to hell.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.900]   I'm going to die for you, cover you with my son's blood."
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:41.900]   And if all He did was not kill us,
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.900]   and not send us to hell immediately,
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:47.900]   we would owe the rest of eternity to thank Him,
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.900]   because He saved us from eternal judgment.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:53.900]   But that's not how the Bible describes our salvation.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.900]   In Romans 8.15 it says,
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.900]   "For you have not received the spirit of slavery,
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:58.900]   leading to fear again,
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:01.900]   but you have received the spirit of adoption as sons,
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.900]   by which we cry, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.900]   "Abba, Father."
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.900]   "Abba, Father" is the most intimate term
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.900]   between a child and his father.
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:11.900]   "Abba, Father."
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.900]   "Daddy."
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.900]   Or "Appa."
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.900]   I remember when my children were younger,
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.900]   at some point, you know, turn 10 maybe, 11 or 12,
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:25.900]   and right around that age,
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.900]   they got to start being cool.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:28.900]   You know what I mean?
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.900]   Like their friends' opinions of them
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.900]   start to matter more than it should.
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.900]   And so they kind of make their transition where,
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.900]   right up to about 12 or 13,
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.900]   everything that they know, they ask you first.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:41.900]   "Daddy, does this mean this?"
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:42.900]   And then you say, "Yes."
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.900]   And he's like, "See?"
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.900]   So their truth comes from their parents,
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.900]   but at some point around 13, 14,
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.900]   all of a sudden, everything you say
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.900]   has to be tested by their friends.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:53.900]   Right?
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:54.900]   You tell them something,
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:55.900]   and then they'll turn around and ask their friends,
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:56.900]   "Is that true?"
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:57.900]   And then they'll say, "Yes."
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.900]   He's like, "Oh, okay."
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.900]   Or then they'll say, "Oh, my friend said this."
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.900]   And they start challenging you at some point.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.900]   So I remember when my kids were right around that age,
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:12.900]   they started to change from "Daddy" to "Dad."
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.900]   And I remember hearing that for the first time,
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:15.900]   and I didn't want it.
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.900]   I'm not ready for you to grow up yet.
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.900]   So I forced them.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:22.900]   Not yet.
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:23.900]   Right?
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:24.900]   I'm not ready to let go of you yet,
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.900]   because that relationship that I have with my children,
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.900]   I wanted to hold on to as long as possible.
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.900]   Right?
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.900]   I think every parent knows exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.900]   To this day, they call me "Daddy" and "Mommy."
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.900]   And I know it may sound weird from the outside,
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.900]   but that's because I want that relationship with them.
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:47.900]   That term that is being used here, "Abba Father,"
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:52.900]   is the most intimate term that can be used between a father and a child,
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.900]   where God says, "Not only did He save us from eternal damnation,
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:02.900]   He raised us up as adopted children to call Him our Abba Father."
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.900]   Anybody else that calls me "Daddy" would be weird.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.900]   Right?
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:09.900]   Nobody would call me that.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.900]   Only my own children.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:16.900]   This love relationship with my own children will be calling me "Daddy" or "Mommy."
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:20.900]   And He says He's using that term to say He raised us up for that purpose,
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.900]   so that He can have us for Himself, to love us.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:29.900]   He said that's the joy that was waiting for Him on the other side.
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:34.900]   You know, Apostle Paul, this man who hated the Gentiles,
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:40.900]   he was willing to murder because he was so nationalistic about his Jewish identity.
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.900]   It's that man who says in the Thessalonians how he loved these people that he used to hate
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:50.900]   like a mother, a nursing mother, and as a gentle father.
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.900]   You know, we may look at that and psychologize this and say,
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.900]   "Well, you know, maybe Apostle Paul has more estrogen than an average male,
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.900]   and that's why he has these compassions."
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.900]   You know, maybe that's his personality.
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.900]   He has a nurturing personality.
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.900]   I mean, look at Apostle Paul before he met Christ.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.900]   See if you see any estrogen in this guy.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.900]   I mean, this guy's gung-ho.
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:14.900]   He's willing to die for Jesus or die for his purpose.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:19.900]   He says what he says because he is simply reflecting the love that he experienced with Christ.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.900]   That was not generated within himself.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.900]   He was simply showing the love that Christ gave him.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.900]   That's why in 1 John 3:1 it says, "See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:34.900]   that we would be called the children of God."
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:42.900]   Behold, look carefully and see what it is that you and I have.
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:50.900]   Again, everything that we do repeatedly eventually becomes mundane, whatever it is.
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:56.900]   At one point, you're so excited about something, but after you have it for a while, it becomes mundane.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:01.900]   Even food, oh, I love this, but you have it all the time, every day.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:05.900]   It's like, oh, we're having beef.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:10.900]   I remember when I was younger, steak was--it's not like today where it's like, oh, I want steak.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.900]   So you have steak tomorrow.
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.900]   When we were younger, steak was not available.
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:21.900]   We would go to Sizzler's, and that was like a huge event, huge event, once or twice a year.
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:23.900]   But now it's like, we have steak every day.
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.900]   I had steak Thursday, so let's have something today.
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.900]   And I had sushi on Wednesday, so let's have something else.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:36.900]   Anything we do repeatedly, we have a tendency to allow that to become mundane.
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:44.900]   The love of Christ is one of those things that if you allow it to become mundane, it affects everything else that we do.
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:52.900]   And that's why he says to behold, to continue to gaze upon Christ, who is the beginner and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:50:03.900]   As soon as the love of Christ becomes something mundane, it affects your worship, it affects your prayer life, it affects evangelism.
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:11.900]   It affects your fellowship, the true fellowship, right, not just gathering of people and doing stuff together, but true fellowship.
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:14.900]   It affects everything that we do.
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:20.900]   He says that everything that he endured on the cross was for the joy set before him.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:25.900]   Sometimes we think of sanctification as somebody who's not disciplined to be more disciplined.
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:29.900]   Or somebody who didn't know the Bible to know the Bible.
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.900]   That if we didn't pray, that we ought to pray.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:37.900]   All of these things are external things that we ought to strive to buffet our bodies and make it our slaves.
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:45.900]   But the primary understanding of sanctification is to restore God's glory in us that we've fallen short of.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.900]   You know what God's glory, God's image is?
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:51.900]   Basically, he created us to reflect him.
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.900]   And that's what we've been separated from.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:58.900]   So when he restores us, he's restoring that image.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:00.900]   Let me give you an example.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:04.900]   I remember when Zachary, our second child, was born.
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:17.900]   I remember the joy that he brought to us because he had a little dimple on one side of his mouth that you can only see when he smiles.
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.900]   It's not pronounced.
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:21.900]   In fact, I don't know. Is he sitting here somewhere?
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.900]   Everybody keeps looking over there.
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.900]   I don't even know if he still has it to this day.
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.900]   But when he was a kid, and he would only see it when he cracks a smile.
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.900]   The reason why it brought us so much joy is because Esther has the same dimple.
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:35.900]   When she smiles, it's only on one side.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:42.900]   So I remember when he was an infant, every time he would crack a little smile, that one dimple would go in.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:46.900]   And for everybody else who would look at that, it's like, "Really?"
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:50.900]   That little tiny little hole in his face brought so much joy to me.
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:56.900]   It brought so much joy because it was a reflection of his mom.
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.900]   That little dimple, that tiny little one.
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:04.900]   I remember Esther and I just being so in love.
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.900]   Because of that tiny little dimple.
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.900]   The Bible says that we've lost this image.
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:14.900]   God created us for his pleasure.
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:18.900]   But when we withdrew from him, that image was tainted.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:24.900]   So when he saved us, he saved us in order to restore us and to restore that image in us.
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:30.900]   And the more that we reflect who he is, the greater joy that it produces in him.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:32.900]   That's what sanctification is.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:37.900]   Sanctification isn't just externally behaving differently than you did before you met Christ.
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:42.900]   It's that glory, that image that he created us for being restored.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:48.900]   That's what he's referring to when he says he endured the cross because of the joy set before him.
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:57.900]   In Colossians 3.8 it says, "And have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the one who created him."
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.900]   That's how salvation is described.
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:06.900]   That we would be transformed to the true knowledge of the one who created him, to reflect him.
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:07.900]   2 Corinthians 3.18
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:19.900]   "But we all with unveiled face beholding in a mirror the glory of the Lord are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord the Spirit."
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:25.900]   So as we gaze upon his glory, his dimple is getting deeper in us.
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:31.900]   His eye color, his heart, his desire, his righteousness, his love.
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:35.900]   All of that is beginning to reflect off of us as we what? As we do what?
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:42.900]   As we behold his glory and we are being transformed from one lesser form of glory to greater form of glory.
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.900]   That's how he describes sanctification.
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.900]   1 Corinthians 15.46
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:54.900]   "Just as we have borne the image of the earthly, we will also bear the image of the heavenly."
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:54:04.900]   So when the Bible describes and tells us early on in Hebrews, he says, "To enter the throne of grace with confidence."
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:18.900]   We have a tendency, because of our works based mentality, we have a tendency to think that when we are doing well, we did righteousness and we gave and we were disciplined that we can come into the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:24.900]   But when we are not doing well, you know, we are kind of like, "Oh shucks, I don't deserve this."
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:29.900]   We are kind of barely, we will get in because that's the only place we can get in.
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:35.900]   There is something inside of us that constantly thinks that we need to be worthy.
[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:42.900]   But when he says, "To come to the throne of grace with confidence," he is saying because you are coming into your Abba Father's throne.
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.900]   Yes, he is the King of Kings.
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.900]   But that's your Abba Father's throne.
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:53.900]   You know, as children, you know, we think, "Oh, you know, my parents have..."
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:55:04.900]   At one point, when you mature, right, hopefully all of you are already there, you realize how much every parent has suffered for you, right?
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:12.900]   Every parent, even the ones that you are mad at, they all sacrifice and suffer for you.
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:19.900]   Imagine coming in one day and saying, "You know, I am going to make it up to you. I am going to give you a car. A nice car."
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:23.900]   Right? It's an expensive car.
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:29.900]   And then give it to your parent and say, "Now we are even."
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:32.900]   Imagine how offensive that would be.
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:41.900]   There is no way you can match because every parent sacrificed everything they had in order so you can live.
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:47.900]   You would have to give your life and do what they did to say you matched it.
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:53.900]   There is no way. Every gift that we give is a gift of gratitude, recognizing what they have done for you.
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:56:00.900]   But there is no way that you can exchange what they have done for a simple car.
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:05.900]   See, in the way that we approach Christ, that we have this mentality that if I am more righteous, if I do more,
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:11.900]   somehow we have a better standing before God because we have done more and God is more at peace with us.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:18.900]   The primary thing, the reason why He wants us to come to Him is because that is the very reason why He died.
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:25.900]   The very reason why He died and He suffered is that it gives Him joy to have us in His throne.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:32.900]   It gives Him joy to see us, to be near Him, to reflect who He is.
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:37.900]   God loves us. It's not He loved us. He loved us and that's why He did that.
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.900]   But He says He loves us.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:51.900]   You ever think why Jesus was constantly praying and again, our thought immediately is He needed energy.
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:57.900]   Because He had so much He needed to do. He needed to pray so that He could be regrouped and be strengthened
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.900]   so that He could go out and do more work.
[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:02.900]   That's not a lie.
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:08.900]   But you ever think that maybe that's where Jesus wanted to be more than anywhere else?
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.900]   That He just went there because that was His home?
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:19.900]   Even if He had all the energy He needed, that's where He knew the love of Christ most intimately.
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.900]   He just did it because that's where He wanted to be.
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:24.900]   It wasn't a task to be done.
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:26.900]   That's where He found rest.
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:32.900]   That's where this love relation, He just went to the Father's throne because God loves Him and He loves God.
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:33.900]   That's it.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.900]   You ever think of prayer and your intimacy with Christ in that way?
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:39.900]   Not just like, "Oh, I'm a Christian. I need to do this.
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:43.900]   I need to make disciples bear fruit so I need to pray and I need to do this."
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:49.900]   You ever think that maybe that when God wants us to come to Him, just simply so that He can enjoy you
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:52.900]   and so that you can enjoy Him?
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:57.900]   Because that's the primary thing that He says while He did all this other stuff.
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:59.900]   The Bible does say that.
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:06.900]   But the primary thing, primary reward for our God was ourselves.
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:14.900]   Not only did Christ endure for the sake of joy that was coming as a result of His suffering,
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:19.900]   joy is the primary motivation why we endure.
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:24.900]   If Christianity has become nothing more than a checkoff box,
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:28.900]   because you have accountability, and somebody's going to call you out if you don't do it.
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:30.900]   You're going to be shamed.
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:34.900]   If that's your primary motivation to get to the next level or to be a good Christian,
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:39.900]   if that's your primary motivation, eventually Christianity becomes a tremendous burden
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:42.900]   that you will not carry for long.
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.900]   You will work hard, but it's not producing joy.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:49.900]   All it produces is what? Thorns and thistles.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:53.900]   Just like it says, as a result of the fall, you will work, you will labor,
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:55.900]   but the end result is going to be thorns and thistles.
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:59:01.900]   And at the end, it doesn't produce life. All it produces is death.
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:07.900]   He's writing this letter to people who at what point did all that God required of them because of joy.
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:09.900]   Hebrews chapter 10, 34.
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:16.900]   "For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property,
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:20.900]   knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one."
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.900]   Why were they drifting?
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:26.900]   They were drifting because they lost their joy.
[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:28.900]   It wasn't producing joy for them anymore.
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:31.900]   They find joy in the world. They find joy in traveling.
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:35.900]   They find joy in food. They find joy in everything else.
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:38.900]   But with Christ, it's an obligation.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.900]   That's what a good Christian does.
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:46.900]   And because of that, you go through the motion at church,
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:52.900]   do what's expected at church, but you feel alive somewhere else.
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:56.900]   That's where it produces rest for you, somewhere else.
[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.900]   That's why we're constantly escaping.
[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:03.900]   Whether it's through media, whether it's through purchasing things,
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:09.900]   whether it's through friendship or traveling, because Christianity has become a burden.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:14.900]   In Hebrews chapter 11, 24-26, "By faith Moses, when he had grown up,
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.900]   refused to be called the son of Pharaoh and daughter."
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.900]   Think about the temptation.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.900]   You and I are not tempted with that.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.900]   Nobody offered a billion dollars if we don't walk with Christ.
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:32.900]   He said he didn't consider that, choosing rather to endure ill treatment.
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:36.900]   He went from Pharaoh's house to being ill treated with the people of God,
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.900]   then to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:43.900]   He realized that whatever temptation was there was only temporary.
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:47.900]   Verse 26, "Considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure of Egypt,
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:51.900]   for he was looking to the reward."
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:54.900]   The reason why he was able to overcome that temptation is because
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:01:00.900]   he was tempted with greater temptation for the joy that was coming in Christ.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.900]   He didn't just will himself to follow Christ.
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:09.900]   It's because he believed that there was greater joy in Christ.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:14.900]   First Thessalonians 1, 2-4 says, "We give thanks to God always for all of you,
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:19.900]   making mention of you in prayer, constantly bearing in mind your work of faith,
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:23.900]   labor of love, and steadfastness of hope."
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:24.900]   You notice a difference here?
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.900]   What's the difference between work of faith and labor of love?
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:30.900]   If you're a Christian and you have faith, you are working in some capacity.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.900]   Some of you are more mature.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.900]   Some of you are more disciplined.
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:35.900]   Some of you know more theology.
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.900]   Some of you are more giving.
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:41.900]   So you can't be a Christian if you don't have faith.
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:46.900]   But along with faith, he says to labor of love.
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:49.900]   And you know the difference between doing something because you love something
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:53.900]   versus doing something because you're supposed to do it.
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:55.900]   There's a huge difference.
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:58.900]   That's the difference between giving.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:01:59.900]   I'm obligated.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:00.900]   How much?
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.900]   What's the maximum?
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:03.900]   What is required?
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:04.900]   Is this mandatory?
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.900]   These are the questions that come from somebody who's in burden.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.900]   Burden because I have to do it.
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:17.900]   And I'll do it because I'm supposed to do it versus somebody who loves this.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.900]   It's like, oh, Tuesday is Bible study.
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.900]   So you do Bible study Tuesday and then you never open up your Bible.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:26.900]   Because Bible is a project that you're supposed to do.
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:27.900]   We pray.
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.900]   Oh, we have praise and prayer, so we pray.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:30.900]   So we pray and we're done.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:31.900]   We've done it.
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:33.900]   We're finished.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.900]   Versus somebody who's laboring in prayer.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:37.900]   Fellowship.
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:40.900]   Everything that we do, it just becomes a project.
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:44.900]   So some of you are good at projects and some of you are not good at projects.
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:48.900]   But that's not what he called us to do.
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:52.900]   Labor of love is ultimately what produces joy.
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:03:00.900]   It's because we have joy we end up laboring.
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.900]   Jonathan Edwards.
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.900]   Jonathan Edwards in his book, Religious Affection,
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:09.900]   describes true affection versus false affection.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:14.900]   And he says in his book, hypocrite is someone who is using God to get something else.
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:18.900]   On the surface it looks the same, but God is being used that if I'm faithful,
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.900]   if I'm a good disciple, if I'm obedient, if I read enough, if I have enough theology,
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:25.900]   that there is good that God is going to bring upon me.
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:28.900]   And so if your mindset is that, when things don't work out,
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:32.900]   all of a sudden we start to question the goodness of God.
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.900]   Why didn't he answer my prayers? Why doesn't he give me this?
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.900]   How come everybody else has it but I don't have it?
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:41.900]   If Jesus is a primary source to get something we want.
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.900]   And he said those are false affections.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.900]   That's not biblical affection.
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:50.900]   But he says God didn't call you, he said, but true affection for Christian
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:56.900]   is someone who has found Christ to be the supreme joy.
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:59.900]   The greatest joy is found in Christ himself.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:03.900]   And that's what he means by if you drink of the things of this world, you will go thirsty again.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:06.900]   If you eat of the bread of this world, you will be hungry again.
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:11.900]   Momentarily you may be satisfied, but you will have to do this over and over again.
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:15.900]   But the water that I give you will well up into eternal life.
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.900]   And if you drink of it, you will never thirst.
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:22.900]   The bread that I give you will well up into eternal life,
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:25.900]   and you will never go hungry again.
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:27.900]   Christ is not just pointing the right way.
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:31.900]   Christ's primary call is to himself.
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:34.900]   Come to me all who are weary and heavy laden.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:37.900]   He didn't say come over here so I can tell you where to go.
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.900]   He says come to me.
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:44.900]   He wants to restore that glory that you and I had,
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.900]   the very reason why you and I were created,
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:50.900]   to re-imprint that on us.
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:54.900]   For his joy and for our joy as well.
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:57.900]   In Psalm 1611 it says, "You will make known to me the path of life.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:00.900]   In your presence is fullness of joy.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:04.900]   In your right hand there is pleasure forever."
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.900]   Do you believe that?
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:08.900]   Is that what you're pursuing?
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.900]   John 17 verse 13, Jesus says in his priestly prayer,
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.900]   "But now I come to you and these things I speak in the world
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:17.900]   so that they may have my joy made full in themselves."
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:23.900]   He came not to burden us of more things to do.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.900]   We're not saying that righteousness and fighting sin,
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.900]   in fact the very next passage it says,
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:32.900]   "You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in resisting sin."
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.900]   So it's not that he's not telling us that we need to fight against sin.
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:41.900]   But the primary call from a sinner to be saved
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:46.900]   is to come and restore that love relationship with the creator.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:51.900]   To enjoy his presence as he enjoys our presence.
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:57.900]   And it is that love that he uses to measure everything.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:02.900]   When that love is not there, it affects our fellowship.
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.900]   It affects our worship.
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:06.900]   It affects our prayer.
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.900]   It affects our joy, our very life.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.900]   John 10, 10 it says, "A thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:17.900]   I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:23.900]   You notice here, the life he's referring to is not opposite of death where, you know,
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.900]   everybody exists forever.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:29.900]   He's not saying that he's going to get people who are not existing to exist.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.900]   That's not what he's saying.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.900]   The Greek word for that is bios.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.900]   The word he's being used here is zoe.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:39.900]   To feel alive is another word to say to joy.
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:43.900]   That he may restore the joy that he intended.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:46.900]   And to restore that when we fell from that joy.
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:50.900]   To love.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:56.900]   This love that he gave us is not something that you and I can muster up ourselves.
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:07:02.900]   Let me -- I want to conclude with this passage of love in 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:14.900]   Which is often used in weddings when a boy or girl is inspired by the beauty of whoever they're watching.
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:19.900]   And they write a love letter, 1 Corinthians 13, because you're godly.
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.900]   Or you take that and you put it up on a wall so that you can be reminded of this beautiful love.
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:28.900]   But I think in many ways that we apply this the wrong way.
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.900]   Maybe not wrong.
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.900]   Wrong maybe is too extreme a word.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:36.900]   That it's not complete in the way that we use it.
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:46.900]   The reason why he writes Corinthians is because this church in their passionate pursuit of religious superiority.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:50.900]   Who's better? Who's more righteous than the other?
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.900]   And so people started to compare.
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:56.900]   You know the people who are disciples of Peter are more righteous.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:00.900]   People who are disciples of Apollos, he's more polished speaker so he's more righteous.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:04.900]   Or Apostle Paul went around risked his life and planted all these -- he's more righteous.
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:10.900]   And so in their pursuit of religious righteousness it caused divisions in the church.
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.900]   Who's better? Who's not better?
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:20.900]   And so this division again the core problem was they were competing for righteousness.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.900]   And then that caused all kinds of divisions in the church.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:29.900]   And once the division came in they started tolerating all kinds of sin within the church.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:36.900]   And so it is within that context that he is writing to them the primary thing that you ought to be pursuing is love.
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:43.900]   If I speak with tongues of men and of angels but do not have love I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:48.900]   If I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge.
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:52.900]   Let me stop right there.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:55.900]   All mysteries and all knowledge.
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:58.900]   That means like you've mastered the Word of God.
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:00.900]   You've mastered the Old Testament.
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:04.900]   You've mastered Leviticus, the book of Numbers.
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:07.900]   You've mastered everything that the Bible has to teach.
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:11.900]   It says you have all knowledge and all prophecy.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:14.900]   And if I have all faith so as to remove mountains.
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:17.900]   Wow.
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:20.900]   If somebody came and said mountain move.
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:22.900]   Right?
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:24.900]   Our church is going to blow up to 10,000 tomorrow.
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:26.900]   Because people think there must be a man of God over there.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:28.900]   He moved mountains.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:30.900]   I've never seen that before.
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.900]   But he says even if you have faith to move mountains.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:34.900]   Right?
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:36.900]   Even if you have faith to remove mountains but do not have love.
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.900]   I am nothing.
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:41.900]   Right?
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:43.900]   Do you think he really meant this?
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:45.900]   Right?
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:47.900]   You better say yes because this is the Bible.
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:49.900]   Right?
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:51.900]   Of course he meant it.
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:53.900]   It's in the Bible.
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:56.900]   And yet you do not know love.
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.900]   Is nothing.
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:00.900]   Verse 3.
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.900]   And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:04.900]   And if I surrender my body to be burned.
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.900]   He's talking about somebody who is being martyred.
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.900]   This guy is so committed.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.900]   He's willing to die for the name of Christ.
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.900]   Die for the gospel.
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:16.900]   Even in his death.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:19.900]   If I surrender my body to be burned but do not have love.
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:22.900]   It prophets me nothing.
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.900]   Wow.
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.900]   It must be important.
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.900]   Right?
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:30.900]   So I must -- I need to practice this.
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:32.900]   Everything is measured by this love.
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.900]   Right?
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:36.900]   Not -- discipline is important.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.900]   Prayer is important.
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:40.900]   Knowledge is important.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.900]   Sacrifice is important.
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:46.900]   But the primary thing that we are judged by is by our love.
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:48.900]   So let's practice this.
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.900]   Right?
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:52.900]   And I want you to do it.
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.900]   If you are watching from today, just do it.
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:56.900]   Okay.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:58.900]   Nike commercial, just do it.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:00.900]   Stop your whining, start loving.
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.900]   Unconditionally.
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.900]   Right?
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.900]   Today.
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:08.900]   Finished.
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:10.900]   Obvious question is like how?
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:12.900]   How do you do this?
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.900]   Let's meditate.
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.900]   Let's draw a picture of a heart in our head.
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:18.900]   And just focus.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.900]   Love, love, love.
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:24.900]   How much meditation do you need for your heart to be like --
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:26.900]   I love that.
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.900]   Does that work?
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:30.900]   Does that ever work for you?
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.900]   Right?
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:34.900]   Somebody wrong you or somebody who is difficult to love, you
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:36.900]   just go into your closet and memorize two verses.
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:38.900]   Like -- oh!
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:40.900]   He said to love.
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.900]   I forgot.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:44.900]   I got to love.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.900]   Okay.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:48.900]   And the most important thing in our Christian faith is this
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:52.900]   very thing that he says, if you don't have, it means nothing.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.900]   Even martyrdom doesn't mean nothing.
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.900]   Doesn't mean anything if you don't have this.
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:58.900]   So how do we have this?
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:00.900]   Right?
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.900]   I mean, nothing causes us to feel more helpless than to try to
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.900]   practice love with somebody that you don't want to love.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.900]   It drains us.
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:12.900]   It sucks the energy out of us.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:14.900]   I mean, it's miserable.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:18.900]   It feels good to take some vengeance sometimes.
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.900]   Right?
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:22.900]   It feels good.
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.900]   It's like releasing some pressure.
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.900]   Of course we would never admit it.
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.900]   But our flesh feels good about it.
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:32.900]   But you try to love somebody that is hard to love or maybe
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:38.900]   even deliberately trying to hurt you, it's not in us.
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:40.900]   It's not in us.
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.900]   Right?
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.900]   The best advice you'll get is, you know, keep your friends
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:48.900]   close and keep your enemies even closer.
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:50.900]   Meaning, keep your eye on them.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:52.900]   Right?
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.900]   Keep your eye on them.
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.900]   That's the wisdom of this world.
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.900]   But to love them?
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:00.900]   Like the way he loved us?
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:02.900]   While we were blaspheming?
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:04.900]   While we were yet sinners?
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:08.900]   Even as we confess our love, we so easily forget in our
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:12.900]   strife, to practice that love?
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.900]   That's not in us.
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.900]   No amount of meditation, no amount of hard work, no amount
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:20.900]   of self-discipline is going to change your inner being and all
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:24.900]   of a sudden start to love people that are hard to love by our flesh.
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.900]   That's why the Bible says, when Paul says, it is the love of
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:32.900]   Christ that compels me.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:36.900]   It is only when his glory is restored that all we are doing
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:38.900]   is a reflection of his love.
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:42.900]   Because you dig deep down inside, you're not going to find
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.900]   love.
[01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:46.900]   You dig deep down, you discipline it and you're like, resolved,
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:48.900]   I'm going to do this.
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.900]   Deep inside, you don't find that.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:52.900]   You find selfishness.
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:56.900]   Anything that I need to do for me to survive, for me to have
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.900]   pleasure.
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:02.900]   Sanctification is when we behold what he's done for us.
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:06.900]   And it begins to reflect, reflection of his love.
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:12.900]   So 1 Corinthians 13, as beautiful as this is, it isn't
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:16.900]   first and foremost, you better do this.
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:22.900]   First and foremost is a description of his love for us.
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:26.900]   His love for us.
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:32.900]   So he wants us to behold his love and once we behold his
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:36.900]   love, once we are inspired by his love, once we are
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:40.900]   transformed by his love, then let that love reflect off of
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:42.900]   you.
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.900]   Then the world will know that you are my disciples.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.900]   That you are near me.
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.900]   That you love me.
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:52.900]   Because you are doing only what you can do because you're my
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.900]   disciple.
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:58.900]   So I want to read this text to you again, but I want you to
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.900]   read it not as a command for you to follow, even though
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:04.900]   obviously it is also a command.
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:08.900]   But I want you to see this as a description of God's perfect
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:10.900]   love for us.
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.900]   So don't think about this is what I need to do.
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:14.900]   Think about what he has done.
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:18.900]   And I want to read this passage and I want you to reflect upon
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:20.900]   this.
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:22.900]   Verse 4.
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:26.900]   Love is patient.
[01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:30.900]   Love is kind.
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:34.900]   And is not jealous.
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:36.900]   Love does not brag.
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:40.900]   And it is not arrogant.
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:44.900]   Does not act unbecomingly.
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.900]   Does not seek its own.
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:50.900]   Is not provoked.
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:54.900]   Does not take into account of wrong suffered.
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:58.900]   Does not rejoice in unrighteousness.
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:02.900]   But rejoices with the truth.
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:04.900]   Bears all things.
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:08.900]   Believes all things.
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:10.900]   Hopes all things.
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:14.900]   Endures all things.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:22.900]   And love never fails.
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:28.900]   Think about every part of this verse.
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:32.900]   He was patient with us.
[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:35.900]   He's kind toward us.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:37.900]   He's not jealous.
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.900]   He does not compete with us.
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:41.900]   Does not brag.
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:44.900]   He's not arrogant.
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.900]   Not unbecoming.
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:48.900]   Not seeking his own.
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:50.900]   Sacrificing for us.
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:55.900]   Imagine if God was provoked every time we sinned.
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.900]   Does not take into account wrong suffered.
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.900]   That once we repent, he forgives and he forgets.
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:04.900]   Imagine if he didn't do that.
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:07.900]   Does not rejoice in unrighteousness.
[01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:11.900]   But rejoices with truth.
[01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:17.900]   Think about all the things even to this day that he's bearing with us.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.900]   He believes all things.
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:22.900]   Hopes all things.
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:26.900]   Endures all things.
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:30.900]   And his love never fails.
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:34.900]   He's calling us to reflect this in our lives.
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:39.900]   Not to produce this in our lives, but to reflect this in our lives.
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.900]   Verse 12, for now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:48.900]   Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I also have been fully known.
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:51.900]   But now faith, hope, love abide, these three.
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:56.900]   But the greatest of these is love.
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:18:01.900]   Do you love this Christ as he loves you?
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.900]   He loves you.
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:10.900]   That's why when he said, if you ask for forgiveness, he's faithful just to forgive you of all your unrighteousness.
[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:14.900]   Because he is eager to forgive you.
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:16.900]   He's not reluctant to forgive you.
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:17.900]   He's eager to forgive you.
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:18.900]   Why is he so eager to forgive us?
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:21.900]   Because he loves us.
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:28.900]   Just like every parent is eager to forgive their children because they want that relationship to be restored.
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.900]   He's eager to forgive us.
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:37.900]   That's why he tells us, come, come to the throne of grace with confidence.
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:39.900]   Don't stiff arm him.
[01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:42.900]   Because that's the reason why he died for us, so that we would come.
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:45.900]   Come, all who are weary and heavy laden.
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:48.900]   I will give you rest.
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:53.900]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart.
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:57.900]   And you will find rest for your souls.
[01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:02.900]   I pray that we would all, every single one of us, would find this rest in the love of Christ.
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:10.900]   Let's take some time to pray again as we ask our worship team to come.
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:12.900]   Have you been drifting?
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:17.900]   Is your heart hardened?
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:21.900]   Are you weary and heavy laden?
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:24.900]   When's the last time you really beheld this love?
[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:27.900]   You know it intellectually.
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:35.900]   But when's the last time the glory of his love affected you so deeply that you desired that above everything else?
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:41.900]   That you're willing to suffer to have more of it?
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:45.900]   Let's take some time to pray again as our worship team leads us this morning.
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.900]   [music]

[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:25.820]   - Let us all rise,
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:28.220]   and as we continue to reflect on God's love for us,
[01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:31.060]   let us sing this closing praise of the Father's love.

[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.940]   Psalm 73, 25 to 28 says,
[01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:25.820]   "Whom have I in heaven but you?
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:28.840]   And besides you, I desire nothing on earth.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.580]   My flesh and my heart may fail,
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:34.820]   but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:38.060]   For behold, those who are far from you will perish.
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:41.180]   You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:44.680]   But ask for me, the nearness of God is my good.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:46.940]   I have made the Lord God my refuge
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:50.260]   that I may tell of all your works."
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:53.500]   Heavenly Father, we pray that this would be more than words,
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:56.620]   but be our testimony and our confession to you.
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.860]   I pray that wherever you send us,
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:03.380]   in spirit and in truth, that we may reflect Christ's love,
[01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:05.760]   that his love will continue to compel us,
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.120]   compel us to be in your word,
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.900]   to compel us, Lord God, to pray,
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:13.160]   to compel us to tell others, Lord, of who you are.
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.140]   Help us, Lord God, to be a Roma of Christ,
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:19.900]   that your glory may reflect off of us wherever we go.
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:21.860]   So for that end, we pray for your blessing.
[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:23.640]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
