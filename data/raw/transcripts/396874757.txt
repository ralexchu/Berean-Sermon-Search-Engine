[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Okay, what Steve Lawson likes to say, this is where you go from taking someone to the
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.760]   terminal and instructing them to get onto the airplane.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.960]   So it's either you're here, the airplane's about to take off, or you're there.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.040]   You gotta be in one place or the other.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.420]   He said don't leave them in between thinking that the plane is still there when it's not.
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.920]   So in the introduction, Roman numeral one, don't feel bad for asking comprehension questions.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.520]   Ask the unbeliever following questions.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.320]   So remember, you don't want to sit there and use them as a wall that you're just talking
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.080]   to.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.720]   You want to know truly if they understand what you're saying, and you want to be able
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.780]   to do that with good questions.
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.520]   So if you use, we said this in the past, but try not to use the yes or no questions.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.600]   Ask them questions that will force them to display or expose their heart a little bit.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.760]   So you can ask, do you understand that, and then repeat what you said.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.600]   So let's say you said you were talking about a topic for one minute, and at the end of
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.840]   it, even though they were nodding along, if you asked, hey, do you have questions about
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.880]   this, or do you understand what I was saying, you'd be surprised.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.400]   They might have been nodding the whole time, and at the end they'd be like, I have no idea
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.460]   what you're talking about.
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.460]   So it helps.
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.240]   Oh, what about it did you not understand?
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.200]   And they'll start saying, oh, you know, when you said this, how does this work?
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.600]   And then what happens is you begin to see where they actually are, rather than just
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.600]   assuming.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.840]   So A, B, and C were the first three points of the Gospel.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.220]   God is creator and owner.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.000]   He is sinless and requires perfect obedience.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.240]   So you stop there.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.840]   Somewhere down the line, and you ask, do you understand this?
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.000]   Do you have any objection to the fact that God created you?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Do you believe that?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Do you agree?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.720]   Or is there something about that that you don't agree?
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.000]   So you kind of go down these lists of questions.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Let it be you're sinful, unable to save yourself, and you'll pay the penalty for your sin.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.960]   Ask them questions again.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.200]   And as you go through, you'll see that even though they conceded to some things, all of
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.480]   a sudden you find them back, like three steps back.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.600]   And you're like, hey, but didn't you say this?
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.440]   And then they're going to have to say, oh yeah, I did say that.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.800]   And so you bring them back to the line.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.360]   So what you're doing is you're trying to put the line here, and you're trying to move them
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.360]   towards the line.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.120]   And when they get to the line, you're trying to move them forward and get them to that
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.440]   line.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.900]   So when you get to that line, reemphasize that line.
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.880]   So that if they drew back a few steps, then you say, hey, but didn't you say this?
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.880]   We agreed to this.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.880]   And you bring them right back.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.880]   And you say, OK, now we can move forward again.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.920]   Letter C, Christ, the sinless Son of God, paid sin's penalty for all who repent.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.920]   Christ, the sinless Son of God, paid sin's penalty for all who repent.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.400]   That's what we talked about last time.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.840]   Letter D, and here it is.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.880]   Do you understand that simply knowing these facts cannot save you?
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.680]   Obviously, this is really tough to get to in what we did yesterday.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.240]   Again, the evangelizing that's with the strangers, and you don't know how much time you have.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.280]   It's hard to display this whole message.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.680]   This whole thing is actually most beneficial for what I would think to be relational evangelism.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.400]   But here, you can actually get to those points, though, with people.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.200]   You can leave and leave them, even though maybe even the entire gospel might not have
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   been fully displayed, and you feel uncomfortable about that.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.080]   You can still leave them in crossroad questions.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.000]   Do you understand that simply knowing these facts cannot save you?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.360]   Do you understand that if you do not believe this, what the Bible says is that you are
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.440]   a hellbound person?
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.600]   And you have to say that very carefully and very gently and with care.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.720]   But if you do, this is where you ought to leave them.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.800]   If this is what you want, because people are nice people.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.600]   Most people you come across are people fearers, and so you can actually use some of that to
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.800]   your advantage.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.540]   You can bring them to these places.
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.400]   If this is truly what you want, though, then you need to repent of your sins.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   And while you don't want to leave them in that place of people fear, you want to bring
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.120]   them and draw them to a place where they fear God alone.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.120]   It's still, when you think about being wise and shrewd, you want to use shrewdness in
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.120]   this, too.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:44.200]   Use whatever capability you have, not to manipulate them, but to draw them to the truth.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.640]   That's a little bit tricky, what I just said, so be careful with what I just said.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.280]   You're not trying to manipulate a person.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.120]   But really do your best in that.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.920]   I'll field some questions after this section.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.280]   Instruct them to repent.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.120]   So repentance involves confession of sins.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.120]   Repentance involves confession of sins, and then repentance results in forgiveness.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:26.720]   Okay, Marsha, can you read for us 1 John 1.9?
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.280]   So we see that great promise there.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.260]   It's kind of an if-then statement.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.240]   If we confess, then He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.160]   all unrighteousness.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.760]   Many people we come across will concede to some type of brokenness.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.240]   And if you can draw them to an understanding of sin, you can say, you can actually repent
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.760]   and confess right now.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.220]   That's possible.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.760]   And many times we feel afraid to get to that point, but that simple offer, people will
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.360]   take it.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.080]   Because people are guilty people.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.080]   Every person is walking around with guilt.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:11.240]   And so if you give them an opportunity, it could kind of come out in a favorable response.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.240]   Acts 8.22.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:23.240]   Is it important that it's a confession of sin, not sins, but sinful?
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.240]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:53.520]   So going back to point 2 of the Gospel in humanity, biblical anthropology would state,
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.280]   at this point, this is all assuming the previous points.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.280]   Just remember that.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.120]   So this does not stand alone.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.720]   This would be terrible alone.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.640]   So with the understanding of trying to get people, everyone feels like they're sinful
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.560]   most of the time.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.720]   And so trying to get them to understand, hey, it's not that you lie, it's that you are a
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.720]   liar.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   It's not that you sin, you're a sinner.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.280]   So getting them to that point will have already required you to have presented God's holy
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   standard.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:31.240]   It will already have required for you to show them you're so much worse than you actually
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:39.600]   thought you were.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.640]   I think so.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.940]   That's why this is really difficult in a cold evangelism setting.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:53.080]   So you have to make the call about whether in a cold evangelism setting you would still
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:08:00.080]   say this is enough to give them opportunity to repent of something.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.400]   Because in a perfect world, you want them to have complete understanding before you
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.200]   get to repentance.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:12.480]   But sometimes I will go to the repentance portion, and then as they're laying down their
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.680]   guard and saying I want to repent and confess over my sin, I'll take them back to a previous
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.080]   point.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.240]   I don't know how to explain it other than as you do this more and more, I think you
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.240]   begin to see more and more things.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.360]   I mean, you guys probably evangelized way more than I did, I think.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:38.480]   I mean, I'm 15 years into Christianity, which is more than I realize.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.960]   When I say it out loud, I'm like, "Oh, that's longer than I thought."
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.480]   I still feel like, in some ways, I still feel like a young Christian.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:55.040]   But yeah, you just have to kind of, it's case by case.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.760]   That's why evangelism class is a little strange.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.440]   You're taking someone linearly through this thing that's nowhere near linear.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.640]   This is such a process.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.620]   It's like trying to think how you would raise a kid.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.120]   It's never linear.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.820]   That's a great question, though.
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:25.520]   C.G., can you read for us Acts 8.22, and then we'll go back to Carmen for the next one?
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:54.120]   You know, that passage in John?
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:01.520]   This is a passage that I went back and forth in a lot in my previous years.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:11.560]   Because I got this, like, "Man, I grew up in such a nominal Christian setting that I
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.280]   felt like the requirement for Christianity, you know, the count the cost portion, was
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:23.040]   so astronomical that I really got that feeling of who then could be saved.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.400]   There's a good part of that.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:30.840]   But then, in the midst of that, I think I really did forget the simplicity of it.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.840]   Look at that passage.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:39.200]   "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes Him, and believes Him
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.000]   who sent me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed on in death
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.880]   into life."
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.560]   You don't want to make people run through hoops that you have created for them.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:11:00.200]   And because of my faithlessness to a kind of a degree, we might look and say, like,
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.680]   be very skeptical constantly.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:08.480]   But honestly, we have to kind of recheck it sometimes and really think, "Hey, is this
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.800]   an opportunity where I could just say this passage?"
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.800]   You know?
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.080]   "Hey, if you're in some kind of brokenness here, but it says here, if you hear His word,
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.120]   and if you believe in Him, then judgment is gone."
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:30.160]   You can become a saved person for all of eternity, like in two minutes.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.160]   It's hard.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.280]   Remember, we're not doing easy believism.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.320]   That's not what we're going to do.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:42.040]   But I think we swing enough on the cautious side for me to be able to say confidently
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:47.800]   to you guys, "Don't forget the simplicity of the Gospel."
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.120]   Let's see here.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.720]   "Turn your heart from all that dishonors God.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.640]   Literally, repent means to think after.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.920]   The Greek word metanoia is to turn."
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.880]   To repent is not to say sorry.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.920]   Although that is very, very much involved in it.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:14.840]   Actually, I like using the word sorry for people because repentants, they're like, "What's
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.840]   that?"
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:22.680]   They say, "Have you ever been sorry about something you did?"
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.120]   And explain to me what that sorrow looked like.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.360]   And so they'll say, "Oh yeah, there's this time I did this, and then, oh man, I felt
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.360]   so bad."
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.360]   I was like, "That's repentance."
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.480]   I was like, "What happened?
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.960]   Let me show you what repentance is.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.960]   What happened after that?"
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.720]   They're like, "Oh, I felt so bad.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.080]   I'm like, dude, I told the person I'll never do this again.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.440]   I got scarred by it.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.000]   It was deep in my mind.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.320]   It changed the way I live."
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.320]   Things will come out.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.640]   So again, help them.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.440]   Ask good questions to help them draw understanding.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.440]   Isaiah 55.6.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:25.000]   "Seek the Lord while he may be found.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.960]   In good inductive study, what you want to do is ask the negative.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.680]   Why would he be saying this?
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.520]   What would happen if this weren't the case?
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.040]   What would happen if you don't heed this?"
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.040]   Kind of that negative part.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.080]   It's like, "Seek the Lord while he may be found."
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.800]   That kind of gives us an air of like, "Oh, it's on me to go and seek him.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.000]   I have some time here."
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.800]   But actually what he's trying to say is like, "He won't be found for long."
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:56.240]   So you can say that to them.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.240]   Luke 9.23.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:04.240]   "If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.240]   follow me."
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.240]   Right.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.080]   Man, we all know that one.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.280]   Luke 15.17, "The prodigal son."
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:18.320]   These are all opportunities to display the free gift of the gospel.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.960]   Because it says in Romans 6.23, "For the wicked sin is death, but the free gift of God is
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.040]   eternal life."
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.520]   As much as we're saying, "Count the cost, deny yourself, take up your cross."
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.160]   I would say, always emphasize the "follow me" portion more than the "deny yourself and
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.840]   take up your cross" portion.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.960]   The "follow me" portion is going to cause the "deny yourself, take up the cross" portion.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.480]   If we say, "You've got to give up everything and then here's Jesus."
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.520]   No, you want to lead with, "Here's Christ.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.800]   Here's what you have in Him."
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.840]   And so when they look to their lives, all of a sudden, Philippians 3.7-11 happens, right?
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.880]   They say, "Man, I count all things rubbish compared to the surpassing worth of knowing
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.880]   Christ."
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.320]   All of a sudden, it's someone who says, "I found the pearl of great price."
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.760]   Which is a story of the entrance into the kingdom, right?
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.640]   That's the story of a new believer.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.120]   The person who is able to see something of such great value that they would sell everything
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.120]   that they have.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.440]   If we're preaching, sell everything that you have.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.280]   Because there's like this thing here.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.840]   That would be incorrect and improper.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.920]   And we would have to say, "Man, what kind of Christianity do I live if I'm presenting
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   it like that?
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   Do I even value it?"
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.880]   This is a hard check.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.360]   But this "count the cost" portion is very important.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.840]   Anthony, did you already read?
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.840]   Okay.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.840]   Nicole, can you read for us Luke 14?
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.560]   [Luke 14, "Now great ministers, you're going along with them and you say that thanks to
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.560]   me, if anyone comes to me and does not believe in his Father and Mother and lies to him,
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.560]   he shall be his disclaimer.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.560]   But whoever does not believe in Christ, he cannot be my disclaimer.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:06.560]   Whoever does not believe in his own past and comes after me, he shall not be my disclaimer.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:13.560]   And if one of you then wants to build a tower, but not in this system, and calculates the
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.560]   cost, his condition has not been improved."]
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.560]   Okay.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.560]   With all this, this "count the cost" is so important.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:25.560]   If you display that to them, you have to remind them that as they go, that there is a great
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   cost.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.240]   And fleshing out the cost, there's so many facets to it.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.240]   You will have to display the church.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.560]   You will have to display a God-centered living and all of that.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.560]   Next one, "Believe in Christ, follow him as Lord and Savior.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:46.560]   Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.560]   That's in Hebrews 11.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.560]   "It is taking God at his word and obeying him."
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:56.560]   Repentant faith is not merely a decision to trust Christ for eternal life, but a wholesale
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.560]   forsaking everything else we trust and a turning to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.560]   "Faith is not a simple recognizing certain facts or exercising mere mental assent.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.560]   This is more than just understanding the facts and assenting to the truth.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.560]   Demons do that."
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.560]   In James 2.19.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.560]   MacArthur says that in his book.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:20.560]   So, you want to be able to kind of take them through this.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:26.560]   "It is a conviction of the truth that responds in or manifests itself in obedience."
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:38.560]   So, Jesus Christ is Savior.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.560]   That's the trust portion.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.560]   And Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.560]   That's the obey portion.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:50.560]   Trust and obey.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.560]   I love that hymn.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.560]   "For there's no other way to be happy in Jesus than to trust and obey."
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.560]   Really, if you simplify the Christian life, I think it is trust and obey.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.560]   Some people will say love and obey.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.560]   It's all the same thing.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.560]   So, Romans 10.9-10.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.560]   Whoever's next.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.560]   "If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus is the reason in your heart that God has raised
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.560]   you from the dead to be with you today, so with your heart confess with your mouth the
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.560]   Lord Jesus is the reason in your heart that God has raised you from the dead to be with
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   you today, so with your heart confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus is the reason in
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.560]   your heart that God has raised you from the dead to be with you today, so with your heart
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus is the reason in your heart that God has raised
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   you from the dead to be with you today, so with your heart confess with your mouth the
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:32.720]   Okay, great. Oh, Ephesians 2. Let's finish that up.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:44.000]   Oops, sorry. I hate doing that with Bible passages. Sorry about that.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.240]   Okay, so that belief is as simple as these things say, you know. Obviously it
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:58.960]   requires a lot of thought, but man, it's pretty incredible how, you know,
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.480]   John 3:16 when it says, "For God so loved the world that whoever believes in Him,"
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.640]   like we get confused by our theology sometimes and we say like, "How does
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:14.520]   election and God, you know, His effectual calling like affect this?" You know, but the
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:19.280]   Bible is, passage right there, it's clear, "Whoever believes in Him," you know. You
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:24.680]   don't have to present like, "If you are elect, then you know, like the
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:29.160]   opportunity is before you today." In our mind we might be thinking, "But if they're
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.800]   not a regenerate person, then can they really accept?" Like honestly, you can't see
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:39.480]   that. And that's not, those passages aren't meant to cause us hesitance.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.560]   Actually, many of the passages on election is meant to be the believers
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.720]   comfort. So when we go evangelize and we have those theologies kind of
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.200]   creating questions where they ought not to be, you know, maybe you should be more
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.920]   familiar with these passages that tell you, "Hey, this is a free gift of
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:04.160]   salvation. Hey, whoever believes in Christ will come to be saved." That
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.760]   gives you the wings and the freedom. You're not an Arminian at that point, okay?
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.400]   Like at that point, like it's, you're a Christian, you're a child of God,
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.800]   you're a believer who is obedient to God's call to go and present a gospel
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:20.680]   that says, "Come all you who are weary." Right? Anyone who wants to buy this milk
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.880]   and this wine, come, it's free for you. Like that's our message. That's
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:32.680]   why our feet are beautiful, you know, even though they're torn up. Okay, so
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.200]   appealing to the unbelievers will directly. This is, okay, this is important.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.400]   So this is what you want to do. You want to go directly to the unbelievers will
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:47.640]   and appeal to it. So don't appeal to their desired perception of
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:53.040]   themselves. Don't appeal to how they've been presenting themselves. Like try to
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.240]   go and dig in and now at this point you've heard so much about this person,
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:02.280]   right? You know a lot more about what makes them tick. You want to go directly
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.240]   to their will. So if you look at this, if you look at the, "Who is God? He is
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.000]   Creator and owns everything. He is perfectly holy. He requires perfect
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.560]   obedience. Humanity is guilty. Everyone has broken God's law. The penalty for
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.600]   sin is eternal death and separation. Good works or intentions cannot save you." And
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:22.280]   then, "Christ the Savior. Jesus came to earth as both God and sinless man. He
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.600]   came to show God's love by dying on the cross to pay the penalty for sin. Jesus
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.480]   rose from the grave and is alive today." If you sit there and you say, "Do you
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:35.520]   believe this?" And they go, "Yeah." They're not a Christian, right? You actually have to
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.040]   take them through the repentance, the considering, and then the belief, right? So
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:45.160]   you must repent and believe. A) You can say this. Like if they say that they want
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:51.320]   to do it, don't get the false assurance of like, "Oh sweet, there's their believer."
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:56.320]   You know? You have to say like, you have to turn away from all that dishonors God.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:01.440]   Like will you do that? If they say no, then you're like, then like you haven't
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:07.880]   seen it. You haven't seen the full picture of all these things. Now they can
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.760]   say like, "Oh but like so I can't ever sin again? I can't like ever struggle again?"
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.960]   Like no, that's not what we're saying. But right now, are you ready to
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.200]   surrender everything and turn away from everything that you used to live for?
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:26.360]   Because that's what's required to follow Christ, right? So it's, I don't know, you
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.680]   know, it's kind of like when you get married and what is that thing? If you
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:35.480]   get divorced and you have the thing where that tells you where money goes
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:42.680]   and stuff? Prenup. It's like a prenup. It's like, wait, like so do you or do you
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.920]   not want to give your life to God? Right now though, don't worry about the
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:54.840]   future. Like where are you? And let's go from there, you know? So from there you
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.680]   can kind of begin to describe what the Christian walk would actually look like
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:04.640]   and entail. In the letter B, believe in Christ as Lord and Savior. And you can
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.720]   ask that. Do you believe? You've understood now what Lord is and you've
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:15.040]   understood now what Savior is. Do you believe that He is indeed that? Do you
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.200]   believe that He is actually Lord? You cannot make Him Lord, but right now what
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:25.560]   we're asking is for you to surrender before the Lord. Do you get all that?
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:31.280]   So clarifying questions. Letter C. And then, hey, will you repent and believe in
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:42.640]   Christ? So if they feel like they're kind of rolling, keep it rolling. Like sometimes
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.880]   there might be times where it's beneficial to say like, hey, let's
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.480]   talk again next week after you think about certain things. But sometimes it's
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:58.280]   like just help them. Help them go, you know? It will make it easier in
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:08.440]   the beginning. Ask, beg, command, persuade. Oh, so if it feels like they're
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:15.040]   walking with you in this, like so they say like, oh yeah, yeah, like I think I
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.240]   understand who God is. I think I understand that I'm a sinner before Him
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:25.680]   and that, oh, Jesus came to die on the cross. And I think sometimes our
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.800]   hesitance and saying like, do you really get it? You know, that'll like cause us to
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:36.160]   stop. But keep trying to push them across those lines, right? So you
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:41.080]   turn and like say, hey, like today then, if you're saying you believe that,
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.320]   I don't believe that you believe, don't say this out loud, right? But in my mind I'm
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.640]   thinking, I don't believe that you believe that until there's a response. If
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:54.360]   there's no response to it, then there is no actual belief in it, right? And so I'll
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.600]   ask the question, are you ready then to, if you say you believe these things, to
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.680]   turn from your sin and to abandon everything for it? And you're like, I'm
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:07.560]   not ready. Then I say, then you don't understand it, you know? You're not, you're
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:12.600]   not, your belief is not real. Because belief is not an understanding of
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.200]   conceptual facts that I've kind of pointed out. And you feel even some layer
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:21.120]   of remorse inside of you, that's not belief. You know, belief will cause you,
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.600]   like if you, if you're presented with something of such great enormous
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.880]   magnitude and it's offered to you as a free gift, like there is nobody that
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.320]   would not accept it. So there is some kind of obstacle here that's stopping
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:42.880]   you from taking it, right? And so like these, these, like walking them down
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:48.840]   these things, will you turn from your sin? Honestly at that point they should be,
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:56.040]   like they should be able to, you know? So, you know, it was really cool. Yesterday one
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:00.320]   of our college staff messaged the college, college staff group and they're
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.600]   like, oh man, one of our students just like repented over their sin and they
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.280]   became a believer, you know? Lord and Savior for the first time. And we're all
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:16.800]   like, like crying. I'm so happy. And so, you know, like, like I know that she had
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.040]   been kind of taking the student down for a while and some of our other students
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.680]   and staffers have been taking this student for a while. It's Beverly by the
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:31.840]   way. But, and you know, she, she understood, you know? And it took so long. But
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.840]   constant crossroads was presented to her. Like we're making it very clear where you
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:42.040]   stand. You are not a believer, you know? And like even in her little group, they
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.720]   would all treat her as that, you know? Like not very nicely, you know? But it was
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.280]   constantly that was presented that you got to turn from your sin. Like, like no,
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:55.600]   you're not one of us. And then she considered, considered, thought through it
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:01.280]   all and then, you know, she was asked like, are you ready to believe again? And
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:07.160]   she did, you know, on Thursday. So it's cool. Like you're trying to move them
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:12.400]   across this line, you know? So does that make sense?
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:27.880]   To this, to confession, repentance, receive God's forgiveness, receive His
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:37.640]   grace. I think, I think a lot of Christian churches nowadays are so good at
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:43.160]   presenting points one, two, and three without helping people into an actual
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:47.800]   thing. And so that's why it has caused the church to create many nominal
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:53.480]   Christians. That's why baptism has been a very watered-down and diluted principle
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:58.800]   or ordinance. And then I also think that's why people resort to quick fixes,
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:05.400]   altar calls, raise your hand, come up, pray the prayer, because it gives some kind of
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.240]   weird confidence. But really to help someone see like this is what it's going
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:14.160]   to look like, like you have to receive it. That's why I like when we say then this
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:19.840]   next part of ask, beg, command, persuade, you're doing everything possible for
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.360]   them to receive this gospel message, like truly. That's, that's, that's, this is
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.200]   our end goal here. Like we want to really get people, like here, we've been talking
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:35.080]   about all these things, but until you get to this fourth principle, like you
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:41.800]   leave them like on that fence, right? And so you have churches, you have pews filled
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:46.480]   with people in the middle ground, like getting convicted. I'm not sure if I'm a
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.680]   believer, but just because they're like playing the game, it fools them into
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.560]   thinking, but maybe I'm okay. We need to be very clear like where this line is.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:00.480]   And you have to, until you help them across this line, like you have to be
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.600]   very clear about that. You are not yet a believer. You have to, you have to turn
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:13.240]   from your sin, you know. Okay, you can read these next three passages on your own.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.280]   Now here's some questions that might be helpful. Earlier you told me your hope of
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.040]   eternal life was in the good work you do. Hey, are you ready now or do you want to
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.960]   trust that God, trust God and believe in Christ? Another one, your faith was in
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.800]   yourself, but the Bible says that for you to be saved, you must place your faith in
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.760]   Jesus Christ as Lord. Will you repent of that and believe? So you're hearkening
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.680]   back to something that they've already stated, right? You've said this, so this,
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:44.720]   right? Like it's a, it's persuasion at its best. You know, it's like we've
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.440]   already gotten here, so the next logical conclusion is here. Otherwise this thing,
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.480]   you haven't even gotten there, you know. That's what Paul does in a lot of his
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.300]   epistles. He says, here you have all these things, therefore this is how you ought
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:01.900]   to look, this is how you ought to live, you know. It's like, oh yeah. So that's what
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.600]   you're trying to do with people. Do you understand what Jesus has done to save
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:10.200]   you? Would you like to repent and follow Jesus? So warning, the sinner's prayer, you
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:15.400]   can go ahead and read through this on your own, but let me just point you to a
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:25.840]   few things. Oh, what happened here? Understand that the act of prayer does
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:32.600]   not save. Understand that the act of prayer does not save. So people are saved
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.360]   without praying, like the thief on the cross, and people pray and are not saved.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:41.640]   Prayer is not the switch that activates salvation. All people are saved
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.040]   completely independent of a sinner's prayer. There is no precedent for a
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.760]   sinner's prayer in the Bible. It is an invention of man. This is not to say
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.060]   sinners should not pray, but we are not saved by a scripted sinner's prayer. We
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.920]   must not lead people to believe simply uttering a prayer secure salvation. There
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.920]   are some who offer the sinner's prayer on a piece of paper and they sign and
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:04.880]   date the paper after saying it. It's dangerous, but repentance will, this is
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:12.440]   Roman numeral two, express itself in prayer. Huge difference. So people have
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.200]   taken point two and then created point one as a result of that. They've
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:21.720]   created sinner's prayer as a result of some kind of truth, but remember,
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:26.360]   B flows out of A. B does not make A. Does that make sense?
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:31.520]   Did I just do something weird there? A relationship with Christ has begun, but
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.200]   salvation occurs the moment someone turns from his or her sin and places
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.640]   their hope for salvation in Christ. This is based solely upon the empowering work
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.760]   of the Holy Spirit and it is based upon Christ's finished work. A repentant person
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.800]   must understand that the basis for salvation is repentant faith in Christ.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:52.560]   Repentant faith will communicate to God in prayer. There's a clear prayer of
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.120]   repentance. I like, I really like having this one in my mind. I think it shows
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:02.880]   such a clear picture. Luke 18 13, "Be merciful to me a sinner." Ultimately
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:08.160]   that's what you want to see in someone in a nutshell. Jesus's comment in verse
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:13.200]   14 reveals that he was saved. Total abandonment of any works contrast to the
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:19.800]   Pharisee and crying out for God's mercy will bring salvation. Conclusion.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:26.840]   Repent, which is turning from sin to God and have faith in
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:33.000]   Jesus Christ. Present the two together. Continual confessing or agony over sin
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.160]   without faith will lead to sorrow and mere legalistic resolutions. Faith
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:42.640]   without confession is unfounded optimism that leads to self-deception. J. I. Packer
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:47.120]   says, "Mere credence without trusting and mere remorse without turning do not save."
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.740]   That would be worldly sorrow and not godly sorrow. Do not be juked. Do not be
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:56.240]   fooled by worldly sorrow. It is important to prompt the repentant person to tell
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:01.720]   God all they have learned. Let them use their own words. So it's helpful. First
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:06.960]   quarter I took someone through like walking down the steps and helping them
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:11.840]   like if you believe this like you can we pray together and ask them to pray and
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.880]   I said can I pray after and then listening to how they pray will even
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.840]   help you see do they understand it's pretty cool but when you hear it like
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.840]   you want to sob like when you hear the real prayer you want to man there's
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:31.240]   nothing like it those are the times when I personally as a pastor in ministry it
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:38.040]   makes everything worth it okay well obviously we're not gonna do this so
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.720]   we'll give I wanted to do this with everybody so we'll do the activity next
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.320]   time but we're gonna do a different activity does any does anyone know what
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:53.720]   the order salutus is okay so this is called the order of salvation this is in
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:34:01.960]   Latin so I'm going to oh I guess we can't keep recording we have to try to
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:09.360]   place this in order okay so what do you guys think comes first in this list
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:37.120]   a different kind of quiz you can't get adopted into your call right regeneration
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:55.960]   I'll just go through it just see if you're right we'll talk about that okay
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:05.080]   so oh all right these are easy right predestined before the before the
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:10.120]   creation of the world Ephesians chapter 1 we have election also there that these
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:16.840]   happen concurrently when does the calling occur there's two two
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:23.000]   possibilities either from the moment you're born or sometime before you
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.760]   become a believer it doesn't happen before you're you're born though okay
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:33.040]   there's no calling okay and then there's regeneration so Karen you asked a really
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.480]   good question don't you repent and then you're regenerated but can someone repent
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:42.640]   without being regenerated can someone see their sin and cry out for God
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:48.480]   without regeneration this is like really let's like play with this idea what do
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.240]   you think about that
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:26.840]   this is I don't know so you would think maybe call okay cool yeah so the reason
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.240]   why this is really hard is because one two three four five this all happens in
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:36.720]   an sometimes in an instant so even though we're putting it linearly here
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:41.800]   it's just it happens but regeneration would still probably precede faith and
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.480]   repentance the reason for that is because this idea of effectual calling
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:51.120]   that's that right there effectual calling when God calls he needs to he
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.720]   needs he's calling someone but that person needs to have ears to hear and
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:02.400]   eyes to see before they can do anything right so in Ephesians 2 when it's an
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.840]   Ephesians 2 chapter 1 when it says you were dead in your trespasses and sins
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.400]   that you want once you once walked you know you were you were living in
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:14.280]   accordance to not all the world only but under its influence under its power
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:20.200]   under everything right and so then is there any ability for you to choose God
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:25.000]   there is it there is there any ability for you to to even cry out for a savior
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.800]   there is it right there might be something that echoes it or shadows it
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.840]   or is a shell of it but what we're doing that's what we're doing as an unbeliever
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.960]   every day of our lives we're looking for a savior somewhere you know and so when
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.400]   God calls then he needs to actually bring you alive in order to receive him
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:49.880]   you know it's a it's very interesting it actually is important without it being
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:55.800]   very it doesn't change much about how we live though
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:21.520]   right we have we have we're saying we're trying to get them here because we can't
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.840]   do anything about there right so actually we can't do any of that so
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:32.200]   we're we're hoping that God is using his words through us to call right that's
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.880]   that's our hope now this right here the reason why I bring it in today is
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:43.520]   because when we go out to evangelize this isn't the the our this isn't our
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:50.440]   anchoring truth this is our what do you call it it's not the truth that's going
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:55.000]   to cause us to move it's the truth that is going to cause us to persevere that's
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.320]   the way I'd like to say it okay so what I mean by that is like we're not gonna
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:09.320]   constantly think like ooh but you know like like how effective is our
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:15.360]   evangelism like what's what is the efficacy in this if if we're not if we
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.760]   can't see certain things right but for us we're saying that all we're trying to
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:25.640]   do is we're trying to be in the process and being used by God to to do this and
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.240]   then when we're trying to think about are they actually a believer we want to
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:35.680]   see like do we see some of these things happening in them I don't know if that
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:40:00.080]   was clear so let's use the word salvation and say this is salvation this
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.280]   whole thing like you a lot of people might even think here up to here at
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.960]   least right and this is like you know a promise but actually the whole thing is
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.920]   on that's why you know when we think of justification sanctification
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:15.320]   glorification many times we think of it very linearly God doesn't see it as such
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:20.520]   how God sees it all what's the passage but he says you have been sanctified
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:25.560]   right and that like throws you for a loop you're like what I'm being
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:30.440]   sanctified right he says you have been sanctified it is a complete done deal
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:34.760]   sometimes he'll say you have been glorified Ephesians chapter 2 is weird
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.320]   right because it says you were Daniel trespasses but God being rich in mercy
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:43.520]   because and he says you have been raised with him right and you have been seated
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:52.000]   with him up like you're like isn't that past tense that's a past perfect so it
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.920]   happened but I'm here and Jesus is up there you know it's kind of weird but
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:02.600]   it's because of the way God sees things versus the way we see things so we're
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:07.120]   trying to linearly put something into into play to see how kind of it works
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:13.000]   logically speaking but what we're saying is God when he looks at it he it's
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   because of the gravity of the truthfulness of this character okay so
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.840]   when he says I will save you he sees everything instantaneously as if it was
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.040]   like done now right because it's that like it's as good as done that's a word
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:31.120]   that's a phrase we use right like even though like it's as good as yours even
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.120]   though I still have it I'm saying I'll give it to you later but you just
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:37.880]   consider it yours because like that's how good my word is here like for God
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:47.960]   it's all of that right so so the questions are really good but this is
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:53.360]   where I don't want us to be so so what I'm saying is like the reason why I
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:57.400]   point this out is because it is important but it doesn't we shouldn't be
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.000]   trying to think of this in the evangelistic sense but what with the
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.920]   reason I bring this up is because we this is what we're trying to hit I we
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:10.120]   want to see regeneration in them okay but we do have this past Friday we had a
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:14.160]   meeting after Bible study and what I was saying was hey there are people who like
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.080]   we're trying to get them to have faith and to repent right like we want to see
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.080]   that we can't tell them to regenerate though right but we can say like hey can
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:29.040]   you repent of your sin we can say that and so when you look at this it's it's
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:35.680]   really cool because I think there is a kind of sorry just five more minutes
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:42.160]   guys if you need to leave you can leave but I think there is a really secure
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:48.120]   comforting type of thought when you realize that maybe they are in the
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:52.120]   process of regeneration sometimes you get confused right you want to draw the
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:56.600]   line so clear that you're standing here and you're saying until they have faith
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.360]   and repent that they are not a believer but I think there's a lot of comfort to
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.560]   be had when you see someone changing and even though you're not sure and you
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.680]   shouldn't say they're a believer you can take take like man are they I might see
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:13.400]   regeneration right now I think that's appropriate to maybe like at least think
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.680]   about it sometimes that's what gives me that final like when you're exhausted
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.600]   in ministry you know we're all exhausted in ministry when you're exhausted
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:27.120]   hopefully when we're exhausted in ministry that's like that final push
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:32.080]   sometimes that makes me like go again and I go again there's like I'm like I
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:38.160]   feel like I'm seeing something here you know like and I'll pray God like like is
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:44.080]   that is that are you regenerating them and and so I'll go and I like you know
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:49.240]   try to try to get them draw them back to the line and see sometimes you'll get to
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.720]   that line again and they just completely reject it you know like sometimes like
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:59.040]   they'll crumble at that line you know and they'll move over and that's really
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:05.360]   cool and so and maybe this was a bad idea I didn't want to derail this but
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:10.760]   just just to kind of follow through God opens your eyes to see to give you
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:16.760]   repentance or a faith right and so you need faith even before you repent that
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:21.120]   makes sense right you can't repent unless you have faith if you try to
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:28.880]   repent in order to receive faith that's does that make sense no I think 50%
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:34.200]   hundred viewers and shake their head okay you need to have faith in order to
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:40.640]   repent because think about the words that happen at repentance dear God would
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:46.480]   you forgive me of my sin there is nothing good in me I need you doesn't
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.800]   that sound like faith that sounds like faith right faith actually leads into
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:57.540]   repentance and then after repentance justification we always think because of
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:01.200]   the Reformation during the time of Martin Luther this became the crown jewel
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:05.160]   of the Reformation justification and people say this is this is salvation and
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:11.240]   you would say no this is salvation if you say this is salvation man that is a
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:15.680]   one-dimensional salvation there's so much it's so much more than that there
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.360]   are so many more jewels like a diamond that'd be like a one-sided diamond right
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:25.560]   you want to see all the facets of it it shines like justification is great but I
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.800]   personally agree with the Puritans who believe that adoption is the crown jewel
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:34.440]   of salvation because if you think about everything you're all now we're we're
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:38.800]   not talking about evangelism anymore okay you know what I'm gonna stop I'm
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.240]   gonna save it so okay
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:58.240]   justification is paperwork in heaven and justification is legal it says it
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:03.680]   declares your edges and that's that's awesome that's like someone being in the
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:07.640]   court and then the judge saying you have to be right here to absolve of your of
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:12.880]   your crimes but you'll cry there right especially if like the destination of
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:17.200]   punishment was like a great punishment so if you can free from that but but
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:22.000]   that's it that's a moment in time where it's been like like in heaven says that
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.720]   you're declared righteous this is how God sees you know it's been nailed to
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:32.320]   the cross is one more but adoption is Wow like adoption you know I love
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:36.320]   talking about adoption because this is song that's saved into the kingdom of
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:40.440]   God and this is not your daily living this is your identity and no one's
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:46.840]   sister and my lives with the identity of just like constantly thinking like I've
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:51.240]   been absolved of all my sin and like the paperwork we actually like our daily
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.760]   living so that criminal was like not freed and becomes like all kinds from
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:59.800]   the record the way they live now is different you know and that's more like
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:04.760]   adoption and adoption describes is so great because justification will get
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:09.160]   into the kingdom of God but adoption gets you into the courtroom of his house
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:15.160]   you know it's like man I would love to get in as a beggar like the prodigal
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.800]   son says right so I just want to be a slave a servant in your household oh
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:26.360]   please you know I would beg for that but for him to say like now I call my son
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:33.640]   that's that's like tear-jerking you know oh man anyway and then
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:38.360]   sanctification obviously is the movement into that adoption says like this is
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.080]   this is who you are this is your identity sanctification will get to that
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:54.520]   no person you know we can't go into all of that so okay so something I did I
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.240]   used to do last week was to think about someone you're going to be sharing the
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:03.920]   gospel so what I'd like to ask you to do on the top of sheet five or evangelism
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:09.280]   custom of five that's the today's worksheet and you can you write down the
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.600]   name of the person and then
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:20.640]   somewhere we ran out of time so share with like a person or two who got like
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:28.600]   just the name of a person and try to try to get like a green next week a like a
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:33.640]   deadline for yourself so I don't normally like to set that
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:37.720]   lines on things like this but for the purpose of this class for accountability
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:42.600]   to you at least to get yourself out there into a place of an uncomfortable
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:50.880]   situation if you can share that deadline with someone so next week we're going to
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.520]   be moving very quickly please come very much on time I'm just gonna be forthright
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:00.320]   with you there is no place next week so just just do all the homework God thank you for
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:09.360]   so great a salvation God that the more we study it the more we oh man I just
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:15.280]   think you have adoption again thinking of everything you've done from the top
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:20.400]   to bottom to monitor just simply safely but there is there is nothing there's
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.640]   nothing I'm boasting for all of us God there is nothing that we can boast and
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:30.160]   you have saved and you alone and father that is our prayer as we go out that
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.760]   that this salvation has been given to us is something that we cannot retain
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:38.880]   inside our own hearts got it it needs to erupt out of our lips it needs to be
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:42.360]   something we live all our lives for we don't all need to be pastors and
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:46.520]   missionaries but God we do indeed need to pastor and we do indeed need to be
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:50.680]   mission and so father I pray for every Christian that we would go out to the
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:55.120]   ends of the world to share this gospel and God it will be very close to us as
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:59.040]   we talk to people and father that it would cause us to the fallen and needs
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:04.360]   to pray for the people that we share the gospel with knowing that you alone can
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:08.000]   save Jesus name you pray
