[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.960]   Hi, my name is Sydney Bellamy.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.460]   I'm currently a first year attending UCI and this is my testimony.
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.600]   I've grown up in a Christian home my entire life.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.400]   Both my parents are Christian, so they raised my brother and I up in the church.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.640]   We would go to church every Sunday and even though this was a weekly part of my entire
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.920]   life, I didn't really go out of a love for Christ.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.560]   Growing up, I just thought this was something you always do and I honestly was just going
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.040]   through the motions when I went.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.880]   I became a Christian in fifth grade.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.800]   I did believe that Jesus, the son of God, died and was resurrected for the forgiveness
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.080]   of my sins, but my reasoning was entirely selfish.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.920]   I didn't want to become a Christian because I wanted to surrender my life and be reconciled
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.240]   with God truthfully.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.040]   I just didn't want to go to hell when I died.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.240]   As you'd think, no change in my life occurred after becoming a Christian.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.480]   By the time middle school rolled around, my friend invited me to youth group.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.280]   I started going because it seemed like the right thing to do, but I still didn't have
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.920]   any burning desire to get to know the Lord.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.200]   But I kept going and I actually started to have an interest in church and in God.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.360]   In eighth grade, I went to winter camp for the first time.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.440]   It was in that time that I realized I never really surrendered my life to Christ.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.080]   I continued to get to know him as such a gracious and loving father and I wanted to be his child.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.280]   For a while, I thought that was when I became a Christian on the last night of camp when
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.120]   they had a call to alter moment.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.800]   But after we came down the mountain, that Jesus high just wore off and life reverted
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.120]   right back to the way it was.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.040]   And even though I wasn't in like the bad crowd or living a rebellious life in my worldly
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.160]   eyes, I certainly wasn't living a life for Christ.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.040]   After middle school, my family and I started trying out different churches.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.080]   The summer right before my sophomore year of high school, we settled on a new church.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.060]   By the end of summer, I finally started going to the high school group, but I was extremely
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.480]   nervous and timid.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.360]   I started going to Bible study with the girls in my class when school began.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.880]   I instantly clicked with these girls and for the first time found a community that seemed
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.880]   to love Jesus.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.080]   I learned how personal a relationship with God is.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.600]   It was then that I reflected on my own life and realized that's not enough to just know
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.280]   that I'm a sinner and believe that Jesus died on the cross for my sins and that I may
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.280]   do because of it.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.840]   I needed to make a 180 degree turn in my life and live for Christ and be an image and reflection
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.520]   of him, not of this broken world.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.720]   I started going to church not out of obligation, but with a heart that wanted to know God so
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.240]   that I could grow deeper in relationship with him.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.200]   Slowly but surely, when it came to doing my Bible study, I actually had a desire to do
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.480]   so and learn more about who this holy God is.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.880]   I desired to show others not just through my words, but also through my actions that
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.840]   my heart and life belong to God.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.480]   I realized that there was no way for God to work through me without working in me first
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.440]   and that I had to die to myself, serving in defiant flesh so that I could be born again
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.840]   through the Lord and be his obedient servant and vessel for his word.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.720]   I can't really pinpoint an exact time when I was saved, but I know that I was saved sometime
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   in high school.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.440]   At the church that I was currently attending, they did baptisms in a way that was very showy
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.680]   and it didn't seem right in my heart to do it there, as it was much more man-centered
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.080]   rather than God-centered.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.320]   I think for all this time that I've waited, I also just wanted to make sure I did it with
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.240]   pure intentions, not just because everyone else had been baptized.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.760]   I've realized what an absolute joy it is to get baptized and make that public declaration
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.240]   that Jesus is my King and Lord of my life.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.640]   I can see clearly in hindsight how faithful God was and continues to be in my life despite
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.280]   my endless shortcomings.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.520]   By the grace of God alone, my walk with Christ has continued to strengthen as I try to keep
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.520]   my eyes fixed on him.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.720]   Going off to college and coming to Berean has been such a blessing in my life as my
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.080]   faith is challenged more than it ever has been, but I'm so incredibly thankful for
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.880]   that and all that I've learned, constantly trying to examine my heart and intentions
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.480]   by hand, every word, action, and thought.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.640]   I've learned how everything in this life is meaningless outside of God and how having
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.480]   an eternal perspective on life is imperative.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.360]   Despite my stubborn and selfish heart wanting to live for myself over all those years, he
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.560]   ran after me with a jealousy and compassion that is unmatched.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.920]   I'm eternally grateful that he did because I now know the permanent joy that is found
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.320]   in living for him, forgiven of my sins, and walking humbly before him.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.320]   I love Romans 5 verses 1 and 2 that say, "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.080]   with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained our introduction
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.960]   by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we exult in hope of the glory of God."
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.680]   It's so humbling and overwhelmingly comforting to know that there's not a single thing I
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.160]   could ever do to deserve salvation, yet God still chose to give me this gift of eternity
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.400]   in a relationship with him.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.320]   Though I was dead in my trespasses, he has given me life.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.720]   He is the only good in me, and I will continue to run this race with my eyes fixed on Christ
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.720]   so that I may glorify him with my life.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.720]   Thank you.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.720]   >> I'm thinking, do you understand that when you go into the water, you're not even pressing
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.720]   your step?
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.720]   And when you come out of the water, you're not even pressing your direction, so that
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.720]   you may continue walking in the water.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:27.720]   That's how you get the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.720]   [APPLAUSE]
