[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   Why don't we turn our Bibles to Romans Chapter 2 and I'll read from verse 6 through verse
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.100]   16.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.140]   But our focus will be in verse 12 through 16 today.
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.620]   11 through 16.
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.900]   Chapter 2 verse 6 through 16.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.900]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.420]   "He will render each one according to his works to those who by patience and well-doing
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.480]   seek for glory, honor, and immortality.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.520]   He will give eternal life.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.880]   But for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.840]   there will be wrath and fury.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.280]   There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.900]   and also the Greek.
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.400]   But glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.040]   Greek, for God shows no partiality.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.520]   For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who sinned
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.120]   under the law will be judged by the law.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.960]   For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.040]   law who will be justified.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.960]   For when Gentiles who do not have the law by nature do what the law requires, they are
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.760]   a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.360]   They show that the work of the law is written in their hearts while their conscience also
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.720]   bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.960]   On that day, when according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus."
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.960]   Let's pray.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.440]   Heavenly Father, we offer this time to you, asking Lord God that your word would be effective
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.400]   in our hearts, convicting us, shedding light, Lord God, not only of our external condition,
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.340]   but even in our hearts.
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.820]   We pray, Father, that this time may be a true time of worship where you instruct your church
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.920]   that you disciple us, strengthen us, equip us for every good work.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.720]   Those of you guys who have Facebook or online, you probably read articles or maybe haven't
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.160]   seen it or even in the Gospel Coalition.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.000]   One of the biggest news that came out this week was that Time Magazine says that Playboy
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.600]   will no longer print nude pictures of young ladies.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.320]   And this obviously in 1953 was a magazine that started and basically was challenging
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.200]   the moral standard of that generation.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.720]   And for so many decades, they were kind of like the standard of, you know, of, you know,
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.080]   girly magazine or whatever you want to call it.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.280]   But the reason why they're getting rid of it is actually not for a good reason.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.320]   It's not because they had some moral awakening and saying, you know, we're going to stop
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.320]   this.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.200]   It's because they can't compete with the pornography on the internet.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.560]   And so as a result of that, they say in the last decade, they probably lost about 70%
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.560]   of subscribers.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.280]   They're not making money off of this.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.840]   And to for business purposes, they realized that their, their format of doing this is
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   no longer working.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.400]   And you know, as I was reading that, I was thinking, you know, this is exactly what God
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.360]   says in Romans chapter one, that they keep going to these sins and refuse to acknowledge
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.960]   God and God gives them over to their lust.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.360]   And so seeing again, those of you who remember what it was like before the internet came
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.320]   in now, you know, what, what, what all the internet, all the other stuff that has come
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.160]   in the dangers that, that every one of you is faced with, all of us is faced with because
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.240]   now this pornographic material is so readily available in your pocket all the time.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.160]   And so if we're not vigilant to stay sober and pure, it's not something that you choose
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.160]   to do.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.640]   It just kind of drifts toward that direction.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.200]   Again, this article and what we read this week, it just, to me, it was a reminder, exactly
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.820]   what God says when that door gets open, sin is never dormant.
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.800]   You know, it always carries us to a place where we don't want to go.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.920]   So we, we're not just kind of cold.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.100]   Our Christian life is not something that we just coast along.
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.240]   We have to determine, you know, just like our theme in, uh, of our family camp in Joshua
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.340]   24 for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.160]   And until that decision is made, until practical things are applied in our lives, the natural
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.480]   direction of our culture is going to go down that direction.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.520]   And so those of us who have children, I know that we're, you know, all the more concerned
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.360]   because our children are going to be raised in that culture where, you know, 20, 30 years
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.080]   ago that, you know, Playboy magazine was what we were trying to avoid.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.840]   And now it's, it's just all over the place.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.600]   And, and what is available on the internet, it's like, you can't even talk about it, you
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.760]   know, at church, it's inappropriate.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.160]   Here's the danger though, as we see where the world is going, we can kind of get in
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.760]   our little huddle in our church and start to think, thank God we have a church.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.320]   Thank God we have a community where we can protect our kids from that.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.640]   And as long as we don't do that, as long as that doesn't happen and we can point fingers
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.600]   and thinking that, well, hopefully that doesn't happen to us.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.160]   The whole point of what Paul is saying in Romans chapter one, two, and three is to remind
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.560]   us that what we see happening in the world is in us.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.360]   That sin is not something that we step on and because we went to the wrong place and
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.640]   watched the wrong thing, that obviously it is sin.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.240]   But Jesus says sin is much deeper than that.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.760]   It is not what you put in.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.520]   It is not what, what you allow yourself to go to, but not just that.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.960]   But ultimately sin is always a revelation of who we are.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.800]   And so that's why Paul introduces the gospel in Romans chapter one, say it is the power
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.320]   of God unto salvation to everyone who believes.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.080]   And so he kind of hypes it up saying this gospel that saves mankind has been given to
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.120]   us through the prophets and it's not new.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.960]   God's been preparing us for this for generations.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.760]   And then he says, so here it is, here's the gospel.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.320]   And then the first thing he says is wrath of God is being revealed to all mankind because
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.520]   they suppress the truth by their wickedness.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.520]   And so starting from verse 18 all the way to the middle of chapter three for two and
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.920]   a half chapters, he's going to be describing the sin of man.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.560]   And so for the last three to four weeks, we've been talking about that.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.240]   I think we're going to be in it another three or three to four weeks on this subject and
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.080]   maybe we're already kind of tired.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.200]   It's like, okay, you know, one message is enough.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.120]   We should have just done one message from verse 18 chapter three to 20 and say, we're
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.680]   sin, we sin and Jesus loves us.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.080]   You know, we'd be great if we just passed over it like that.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:31.040]   But there's a reason why Paul takes so much time to sit down and calculate and dig into
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:38.760]   the details and thoughts and condition of man so that when he introduces Christ, that
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.240]   we recognize Christ for who he is, what it is that we ought to have or what it is that
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.140]   we ought to recognize and lead us to worship.
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.760]   At the end of verse 11 chapter two, verse 11, he sums up what he's been saying before
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:02.080]   and he also sums up what he's going to say in this short statement for God chose no partiality.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.880]   God chose no partiality.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.080]   Now if you read that and if you know the Bible history, you may have a question that I had
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.760]   when I first encountered this.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.760]   God has no partiality.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.640]   I mean, isn't the whole understanding of the gospel is that God chose a nation of Israel?
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.640]   I mean, he seemed like he was partial to the nation of Israel.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.820]   In fact, even when he says, you know, the gospel is the power of God unto salvation
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:33.840]   to everyone who believes, first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.640]   Very beginning of the calling of the nation in Genesis chapter 12 verse 3, God tells Abraham
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.360]   and his descendants, "I will bless those who bless you and him who dishonors you I will
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   curse."
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.880]   Again, in Deuteronomy 7, 6, "For you are a people holy to the Lord your God.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.240]   The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession out of all the
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.200]   peoples who are on the face of the earth."
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.480]   So when we read that, the first question is we may ask, well, that sounds like he's partial.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.440]   Sounds like he's playing favoritism, right?
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.060]   On the surface, we may see that.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.720]   But I think one of the best evidence that we see of God's impartial judgment, we see
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:20.240]   from the very beginning, if there was any being that God would have shown favoritism
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.840]   or overlooked in their sin, it probably would have been Lucifer.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.400]   You know, I know now we, when we say the word Lucifer, it kind of gives you, you know, chills.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.760]   It's like that's a representation of evil.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.280]   But that's not the way that the Bible portrayed him in the beginning.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:43.240]   It says in Ezekiel 28, 15 to 17, this is a description of Satan.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:49.840]   Lucifer, he says, "You were the signet of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.920]   beauty.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.800]   You were in Eden, the garden of God.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.040]   You were an anointed guardian cherub.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.640]   I placed you, you were on the holy mountain of God.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.440]   In the midst of the stones of fire, you walked."
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.120]   And it goes on and on, description about his beauty, about his power, how he, God placed
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.080]   him above all the other creation.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.160]   And so in essence, what the scripture says is of all the created things that God has
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:18.920]   personally created, the most beautiful, the most powerful, the highly exalted was Lucifer
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.520]   himself.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.400]   So if there was any being, any person that God could have showed favoritism to, it would
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.400]   have been Lucifer.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.080]   But you know how the rest goes.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.440]   In verse 17 it says, "Your heart was proud because of your beauty.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.760]   You corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor."
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.760]   In order to exalt yourself, you began to challenge God.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:46.160]   And as a result of God, the scripture says, "I cast you to the ground."
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.600]   If God was going to show any kind of favoritism, any kind of just look over their sin, it probably
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.800]   would have been Lucifer.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:10:01.280]   But even Lucifer, when he challenged God and he wanted the glory for himself, he was judged.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.800]   What you and I need to remember is that the scripture makes it absolutely crystal clear
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.680]   that God is not a God who can say one thing and does something else.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.160]   He is a God, what he says, he accomplishes.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:20.740]   And Habakkuk 1.13 says, "You who are of pure eyes and to see evil and cannot look at wrong."
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.080]   When he says that, he's not just saying that about certain people.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.600]   He's not saying that there's some people that he can't stand when they sin, and then there's
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.900]   some people that sin and he says he's okay with.
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.600]   You know that all the Gentile nations, when they sin, God is angry with them, but when
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.920]   Israel sins, God is okay with.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.680]   He never says that.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.760]   If you look at Israel's history, God is faithful to the nation of Israel.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.520]   In fact, the reason why I believe the nation of Israel, even to this day, exists is because
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.240]   God made a covenant with Abraham that I will bless you and through you, all the other nations
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.900]   are going to be blessed.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:01.520]   So if you look at Old Testament history, even in the midst of sin, God doesn't forsake them
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.680]   as a whole, as a people.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:09.040]   But the people who sin in Israel, are they judged?
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.160]   Consistently.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.720]   Consistently.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.600]   So when he says he's faithful and he chooses the nation of Israel, he is committed to the
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.720]   nation of Israel.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.520]   But he is impartial to those who sin.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:30.800]   So if you look at the book of Numbers, and it's a story of how 600,000 men enter into
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.640]   the desert, when they come out, they have 600,000 people going into the promised land.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.160]   But in between, it is a record of the sins of Israel.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.520]   Those who sin against God, their tribes actually diminish and they decrease because they're
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.520]   judged for their sins.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.920]   And those who are faithful, they actually increase.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.400]   So by the time they exit, they have the same number of people, but the number of the tribes
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.460]   either increases or decreases based upon their sins.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.160]   You look at the church.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.720]   Jesus says, "I will build my church and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.040]   He said that about the universal church.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.360]   And the mistake that we make is that we think, "Well, we're the part of the church, so no
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.080]   matter what I do, God is not going to look at my sin because he said he's going to cover
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.740]   us."
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.840]   The way God deals with sin, he says he will be impartial.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:28.520]   What he says he will do, Psalm 5, 4-6, "For you are not a God who delights in wickedness.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.040]   Evil may not dwell with you.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.180]   The boastful shall not stand before your eyes.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.180]   You hate all evils.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.080]   You destroy those who speak lies.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.880]   The Lord abhors and bloodthirsty and deceitful man."
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.040]   God is faithful to Israel.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:47.320]   God is faithful to the universal church of God.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.120]   But God will judge all sins.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.160]   And he will be impartial in the way that he judges sins.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.160]   In fact, the word "impartial" itself literally means to "search face."
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.880]   Now if we translated that literally, you'd be like, "God is search face."
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.880]   What does that mean?
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.480]   God will search face.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:14.460]   The word literally means that God is not going to be looking at the surface and your background
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.560]   and your heritage.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.480]   And that's not the way that God judges.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.960]   We see a perfect picture of that in 1 Samuel 16, 6-7, when God rejects Saul for his sin
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.120]   and he sends a prophet to go anoint David.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.040]   He goes to David's home and finds his older brother and he looks regal.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.960]   He looks like a king that would fit a king.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.440]   Tall, handsome, strong.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.800]   This is a guy that the nation would follow.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.800]   And this is what God says to him.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.360]   "Surely the Lord's anointing is before him.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.600]   But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.280]   stature because I have rejected him.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.840]   For the Lord sees not as man sees, but man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.200]   looks on the heart.'"
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.320]   In other words, God is able to see beyond that and sees who they really are.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.120]   So God chose David because he was a man after God's own heart.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.480]   He says God's judgment is perfect.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:17.400]   The reason why you and I need to realize and recognize that is until we recognize that
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.940]   only God is able to make perfect judgment.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.560]   You and I are not capable of being impartial in our judgment.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.040]   No matter how much you think you are being impartial.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.080]   There's no human being who can be completely impartial.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.400]   Every person that we judge, every situation we judge, we judge from our perspective, from
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.760]   our sins, from our selfishness, from our pride.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.500]   And so every judgment that we make of another person, it is always coming through a filter
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.000]   of my own sins.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.520]   Well, I've been offended, so we tend to overreact.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.000]   You know, I don't want you to think poorly of me, so I'm going to judge you, you know,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.320]   I'm going to sweep it under the rug.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:01.540]   Every single one of us, because we've been tainted with sin, our judgment is always going
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.920]   to be partial.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.300]   Only God is able to be completely impartial.
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:11.620]   Only God can know what is really in your heart.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:18.680]   Only God, who is perfectly holy, can look at a situation and is able to judge this is
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.080]   right or this is wrong.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:30.400]   So the scripture tells us that the beginning of wisdom comes from fear of the Lord.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.760]   And the fear of the Lord is the beginning when we recognize that God and God only is
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.320]   the one who can be perfectly just.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.040]   Think about what's going on in the Middle East today.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.480]   And one of the questions that constantly comes up is, "How come the United States just go
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.040]   in there and just, you know, like, you were supposed to be the superpower.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:52.680]   We have all this billions and trillions of dollars that are spent to build up the US
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.680]   military.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.360]   Why don't we go there and just straighten it out?"
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.060]   The biggest problem with what's going on in the Middle East is we can't recognize who's
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.440]   doing right and who's doing wrong.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.380]   You know, as soon as you come and bomb this group, and this group is bombing this group,
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:11.680]   you know what I mean, that's bombing you, you know what I mean, so if we bomb them,
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.180]   they're going to stop bombing the people who are bombing us.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.160]   And so it's a mess.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.540]   It's hard to go and even recognize.
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:24.280]   So we have a nation, we have a world full of people who are absolutely convinced that
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.520]   their position is right.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:31.640]   And so my point here is not to get political in saying we're right and they're wrong, right?
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.720]   But even in human relationship, wars begin because we have a hard time deciphering what
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.120]   is just and what is not just, what is right and what is wrong.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.080]   We can't even distinguish that even between husband and wife.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.800]   Two people who live together, who talk to each other every single day, have problems
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.600]   understanding each other.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.740]   And why do you get into fights?
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.600]   You never get into a fight if the husband says, "I'm wrong."
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   Fight over.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.000]   Or the wife says, "I shouldn't have said that.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   I apologize."
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.760]   Fight over.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.760]   You get into fights because wife thinks she's right and the husband thinks he's right.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:14.040]   And you bicker to try to argue back and forth and whoever has the better argument wins.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.160]   And sometimes you win and you lose at the same time.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.880]   You know exactly what I'm talking about, right?
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.760]   You can't win, right?
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.840]   We're talking about two people who are in a covenant relationship, talk to each other
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:34.000]   every single day, doing their best to understand each other, and come to a conclusion who is
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.720]   right and who is wrong.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.320]   How are we going to come to a conclusion with people that we run into every once in a while
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:45.840]   or people that we don't even know in a distant place, people who grew up in different cultures?
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:52.500]   So you and I have to first recognize, first and foremost, that you and I do not have the
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.380]   ability to judge right and wrong.
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.380]   We don't.
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:03.520]   And the problem that we get into is a lot of times we are so proud of our judgment and
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.640]   our logic that we trace it all the way back and if God's logic doesn't fit my logic, what
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.240]   do we do?
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.280]   We judge Him.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.940]   If God is just, He should do this.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.200]   It's not just for Him to do this.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.120]   Why would He judge these people for these reasons?
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.640]   Because from my perspective, it doesn't seem right.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.640]   So what do we do?
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.960]   We go back and we judge Him.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.760]   So we either accept Him or don't accept Him.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.600]   We look at situations and say, "Oh, God is gracious or He's not gracious," based upon
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.120]   my judgment from my perspective.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.440]   Speaking of all wisdom is when we learn, first and foremost, to fear God.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:48.720]   When we recognize that He and He alone can be completely partial or impartial.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:54.560]   Deuteronomy 32, verse 4 says, "The rock, His work is perfect for all His ways are just.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.760]   A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and upright is He."
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.680]   He is perfect in His judgment.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.580]   So the point that Paul is trying to get at and why that statement is here is in order
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:13.400]   to convince us and convince a reader of Romans that the judgment that is coming upon mankind
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.160]   is a perfect judgment.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.600]   There's not a single human being who will be judged before God unjustly.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.120]   There's no human being that's going to be judged for eternity who is going to be judged
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:30.200]   partially, that it was going to be unjust.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:36.140]   You guys know the picture of, you know, if you see a statue of justice, what's the statue
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.140]   that you know?
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:42.880]   I was going to bring a video, but not video, but a slideshow, but I chose not to.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.880]   What is the picture that you see?
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.920]   It's a picture of a lady.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.720]   She's blindfolded and she has a scale, right?
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.760]   You ever wonder why the blindfold?
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:20:00.720]   Yeah, because if you're not blindfolded, the natural tendency is for us to be prejudiced.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.000]   So we see and say, "Oh, that's my mother," or "Oh, I know this person, so I should be
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.560]   more just to that person," or "This person's rich," or "That person can benefit me," or
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.160]   "If I do this, how are they going to treat me?"
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:17.600]   So every human being is going to be partial based upon our selfish desire.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.400]   What are you going to think of me?
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.520]   Or you've offended me, so therefore you're going to deserve more justice.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:28.440]   So in the criminal justice system, if somebody seems to be overly biased in some way, like
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.860]   there's a family member.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.520]   So if you go to the court, you know, if you ever had jury duty, one of the questions that
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.680]   they ask you is, "Do you know one of the attorneys that work here?"
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.440]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.280]   And then, so you say yes, and then you're out.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.640]   They don't want you in there, because they already assume that your judgment is not going
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.640]   to be clean, right?
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.920]   You're going to be biased toward them one way or the other, right?
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:58.200]   So again, even in our justice system, we recognize that bias is part of who we are.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:03.560]   So therefore, how do we determine what is right and what is wrong?
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.720]   How do we determine in our mind what should be and what should not be?
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.240]   What is right, what is wrong?
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.840]   What is good and what is bad?
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:19.480]   That judgment in and of itself is not coming from our culture, it's not your upbringing,
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.680]   it's not because you're a Democrat or a Republican, it's not because you're educated or uneducated,
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.160]   what culture you were brought up in, that everything that you and I know to be right
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:37.480]   or wrong has to be tested by the only being who can be perfectly impartial, which is our
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.520]   God, which is His Word.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:48.120]   So therefore, he says, God who is, the wrath of God is being revealed is completely impartial.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.320]   Now, if I ended this here, we're in big trouble.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:59.480]   Because the reason why Paul says this is to justify what he's been saying.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.160]   Here comes the wrath of God.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.760]   And those who have the law will be judged with the law.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.360]   Those who don't have the law will be judged without the law.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.320]   But the end conclusion is, you will be judged.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.840]   And the wrath of God is coming.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.560]   And there's nobody who's going to stand under the wrath of God and say, this is not fair.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.640]   Everything he does is going to be completely and perfectly fair, whether we see it or not.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.160]   See he goes on and he gets more specific.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:32.040]   And he said, well, what about those Jews who've had the law and all their for centuries they
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.400]   were trying to obey the law.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.400]   What about them?
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:41.520]   Well, he says, those who have the law will also perish with the law and who have sinned
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.360]   under the law will be judged by the law.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.200]   For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.160]   law who will be justified.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.720]   So in other words, any of you who are proud because you have the law, he says, you're
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.240]   also in trouble.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.920]   Remember in Matthew 3, 7 through 10, John the Baptist comes out and everybody recognizes
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.920]   him as a prophet from God, right?
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.000]   Even the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the scribes were coming and they saw that he's
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.760]   not at the temple.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.680]   He's dressed like an Old Testament prophet.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.960]   He's acting and talking like an Old Testament prophet.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.760]   So people are intrigued.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:24.480]   Now John the Baptist, at least from what we see in the scriptures, didn't perform miracles.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.280]   They weren't coming out because he was feeding them.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:31.720]   It was just he, everybody recognized that there was an authority about this person and
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.760]   they came and they were being baptized by him.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:39.320]   And when he saw the Pharisee and the Sadducees come, he saw them, he said to them, you brood
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.040]   of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come, bear fruit in keeping with
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:49.280]   repentance and do not presume to say to yourself, we have Abraham as our father, for I tell
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.360]   you God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.880]   Even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.360]   Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.280]   He was indicting them, right?
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:09.280]   Now let me, before we jump on the Pharisees, okay, let me ask you a question.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.360]   Did God want the nation of Israel to obey the law?
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.760]   Don't say anything.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.800]   I just want you to think for a minute.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.560]   Did God intend the nation of Israel to obey the law?
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.520]   Absolutely.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.920]   God wanted the nation of Israel to obey the law.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:31.640]   So he rejoiced when they obeyed and he was saddened when they didn't obey.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.960]   Who obeyed the law the best?
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.200]   Okay, don't answer.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.520]   I want you to think about it.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:46.480]   If God wanted Israel to obey the law, who obeyed the law the best?
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.480]   The Pharisees did.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:52.760]   You say, oh, the tax collector, you know, they're the ones that God favored and they
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.840]   did all of that.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.180]   The tax collectors didn't obey the law.
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.180]   These guys were traitors.
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.180]   They were cheating people.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.580]   They were sinning against God, right?
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:06.320]   So we have a tendency to kind of like, because we've already stamped these people as bad
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.560]   people, you know, Pharisees, they obey the law, you know, but they, they were against
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.680]   God, but these tax collectors were better.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.440]   No, these guys were sinners.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.040]   The fishermen, you know, maybe they were better off.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.160]   Maybe that's why God saw some righteousness in the fishermen.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.560]   And that's why they were favored by God.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:27.640]   These fishermen, you know, they probably didn't go to the temple that often.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.360]   They didn't take, they didn't know the Torah.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.200]   The Pharisees were the one who memorized scripture.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.520]   They fasted, they prayed.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.480]   They're the ones who gave to the temple.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:42.080]   In fact, the scripture says that they would go far distances to make disciples.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.320]   And yet he said, you did all of that.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.320]   You prayed in public.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.520]   You did all of that for a show.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.440]   You have to understand that the judgment that came upon, the reason why God pointed them
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:58.660]   out is not because the tax collectors and the fishermen and the common people were somehow
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.480]   more righteous before God.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.480]   Then why were they judged?
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.680]   Why were they singled out?
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.400]   The Pharisees were the ones who were trying so hard to keep the law.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.080]   And yet God brings judgment upon them.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.800]   He singles them out to rebuke them.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.200]   What was he trying to do?
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:20.440]   Well, if you remember in Matthew 15, one through nine, he rebukes these Pharisees and scribes
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:26.240]   and says, you hypocrites, you, you have certain amount of money donated to temple.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.280]   And then you use that as an excuse not to take care of your parents.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.480]   Remember what Jesus says?
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.960]   You should have done one without neglecting the other.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.480]   He didn't say you should have done this and not done this.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   Right?
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:42.880]   So what he was saying is, here's what you're doing, but what you should have done was this.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.840]   Now were the tax collectors even doing this?
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.520]   No, they weren't even doing this.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.720]   You get what I'm saying?
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.920]   Okay.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.400]   The Pharisees at least was doing this.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:01.000]   They were at least tithing, at least praying, at least giving, at least proselytizing, even
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.440]   though they were doing it wrong.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.840]   They were doing this, but Jesus didn't say you did the wrong thing.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.960]   You should have been doing this.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.280]   No, Jesus said you should have done this without neglecting this.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.360]   Right?
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.400]   So the tax collectors weren't even doing this.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.780]   He says again in Matthew 19 through nine, he says, when it comes to divorce, you follow
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.300]   Moses's law to give a certificate and then you would get divorced.
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:30.600]   But I say to you that you should not be divorced in any reason other than infidelity.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:35.700]   So he says you're doing this, but you should have done this.
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:43.040]   So in other words, his rebuke to them is that they weren't obeying the commandment enough.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.380]   They weren't obeying the commandment enough.
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.160]   Let me take it another step.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.940]   Remember the rich young ruler, March 10, 17 to 22?
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:56.200]   Here's a rich man, rich young ruler that comes and respected by the society.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.920]   This is not a Pharisees who's looking down on people.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.640]   He just comes and asks an honest question.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:06.080]   He says, good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.920]   Jesus said to him, why do you call me good?
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.360]   No one is good except God alone.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.120]   In other words, you don't know who I am.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.120]   Right?
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.560]   He says, you're calling me good, but you don't realize who you're talking to.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.880]   You know the commandments.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.880]   Do not murder.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.880]   Do not commit adultery.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.880]   Do not steal.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.760]   Do not bear false witness.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.760]   Do not defraud.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.640]   Honor your father and mother.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.860]   Now, you know, Ray Comfort has a video series where he goes out and he interviews people
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.960]   for evangelism and it's, are you a sinner?
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.960]   He says, no, I'm not a sinner.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.480]   And then he'll go through the 10 commandments and did you break this?
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.480]   Did you break this?
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.680]   And almost always he says, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.560]   And then they'll say, so are you a lawbreaker?
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.560]   Yes.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.560]   Are you a sinner?
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.560]   Yes.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.560]   Right.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.960]   And here's a problem with this man.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.560]   Jesus basically does Ray Comfort, right?
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.000]   So Jesus was the Ray Comfort before Ray Comfort.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.600]   So he comes and asks him, here's the 10 commandments.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.600]   And did you do this?
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.600]   This is this, this, this.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.720]   And the man says, yes.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.560]   And he meant it.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.200]   He was a, he was a good man.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.200]   He wasn't just faking it.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.520]   He said, I did all of that.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.520]   Right.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.960]   But look at Jesus's response.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.720]   He says, the young man says to him, the teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.640]   Now, before we harp on him, okay, before we harp on, he doesn't know his sin.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   He's lying.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.640]   He's covering it up.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.640]   He's self-righteous.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.880]   Remember the way Paul described himself before he met Christ?
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.500]   He said Hebrew of Hebrews.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:33.520]   When it came to the law, what did he say?
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.520]   Perfect.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.880]   This, this is exactly how Paul would have answered that question, because that's how
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.340]   Paul viewed himself.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.120]   That's how he described himself before he met Christ.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.280]   Right.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.120]   So as to the law, he said, I done it.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.040]   But look at what Jesus says in verse 21.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.340]   Jesus looking at him.
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.220]   And here's the part I want you to pay attention to.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.280]   Jesus hears this and he's not angry with this man.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.280]   Right.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280]   He doesn't say, are you self-righteous?
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.520]   You know, who do you think you are?
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.520]   He doesn't say that.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.040]   He says, you obey all these commands.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.080]   If you want to inherit eternal life, do all of these things.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.320]   He says, I did all of that ever since I was young.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.120]   I always obeyed this.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.120]   Right.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.120]   And Jesus looking at him, loved him and said to him.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.920]   Loved him and said to him, you know, maybe some of you guys have been reading this passage
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.320]   and you missed that part where you think that Jesus is shutting the door.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.680]   He said, oh, I want to go in.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.720]   This is not the right door.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.720]   Shut the door.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.720]   Get out of here.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.600]   That's not what Jesus does.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:32.920]   It says, looking at him, loved him and said to him, you lack one thing.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.960]   Sell all that you have and give to the poor and you will have treasures in heaven and
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   come follow me.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.520]   It doesn't say in this passage, but in another passage it says Jesus does that because he
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.840]   knows he was rich.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.420]   He knew he couldn't do this.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:51.880]   And so he tells him, if you want to inherit eternal life, he says in love, he basically
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.880]   shuts the door.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.880]   He says, this is not it.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.840]   Basically, what was Jesus saying?
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.320]   You can't enter this way.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.760]   You can't enter knowing he couldn't do it.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.120]   He puts it to him.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:07.680]   And as a result, he says, disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful for he
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.840]   had great position possession.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.300]   Now the response of the disciples of this was exactly what Jesus was trying to get at.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:20.800]   Not only with the disciples, with this man, they respond to him saying, if that man who
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:27.440]   was perfect in obedience to the law, at least part of that, and he couldn't get in, what
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.440]   about us?
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.600]   I mean, I used to cheat people in taxes.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.880]   I'm a, I'm a fisherman.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.480]   You know, I didn't even consider the law until I met you.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.480]   You know, I would have been guilty.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.920]   I mean, if this man cannot enter, what about us?
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.160]   So they're in fear.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.860]   And Jesus says, what man cannot do, God will do.
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.680]   What man cannot do, God will do.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.000]   What was he saying?
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.380]   He said, what you cannot accomplish by your own own will, God will do.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.880]   And obviously he was referring to the cross, the very reason why he came.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.680]   And so he lovingly tells him, he says, yes, he doesn't, he doesn't rebuke him for obeying
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.680]   the law.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:13.360]   You're obeying the law, but you don't realize that this law cannot save you.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   Right?
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.880]   God wants you to obey the law because it's good for you.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.760]   God wants you to be a man of the law, but this law cannot save you.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:26.160]   It may guide you, it may direct you, it may be a light onto your path, but it cannot save
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.640]   you.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:34.480]   No man by his own doing can stand before this perfect, holy, holy God and think that somehow
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.480]   he's going to be declared righteous.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:42.120]   So he shuts the door on him because that door was never opened in the first place.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.720]   And to redirect him to the cross.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.320]   See that's what he's saying to the Jew.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   If you rely on the law, you will be judged by the law.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.880]   If you're relying on your discipline, if you're relying on your experience and how much scripture
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.560]   you memorize and how much prayer that you give and how much money that you give, if
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:08.480]   you rely on that for your righteousness, you will be judged by that because you will never
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.420]   be perfect enough.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:15.720]   You will never pray enough, you will never give enough, you will never sacrifice enough
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.560]   to be declared righteous before God.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.560]   So what is he doing?
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:25.280]   He's taking this man and humbling him because only by humbling him can he see the glory
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.480]   of the cross.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:32.720]   And that's what he's doing throughout this whole three chapters is he's turning the light
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.720]   off.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.880]   Every single one of them.
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:41.080]   Just like we turn the lights off so that we can see the screen better, he's turning the
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.080]   lights off.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:50.400]   They're making sure that they recognize that what you see out there is not just them.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.280]   It's in here.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.280]   It's in all of us.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.600]   Whether you are a church hander, whether you've been at church all your life and been Sunday
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.360]   school, never missed a day of church on Sunday, no matter what your background is, whatever
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:08.760]   it is that you have achieved, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.280]   But it's not just the Jews.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.880]   He goes on to the Gentiles.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.640]   And here's a question that comes up all the time.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.400]   Well, what about the people who've never heard the gospel?
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.640]   What about the, how will they be judged?
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:23.040]   I can see that the law will judge the Jews, but what about those people who've never heard
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.720]   the gospel?
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:30.880]   You know, years ago when I was in seminary, one of our assignments, project was that we
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.120]   would have to attend this evangelical theological society, ETS.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.640]   And we were basically sitting in the back and watching these PhDs.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.720]   Some of them had been studying the Bible for 40, 50 years.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:46.600]   And I was in a room filled with about 500 men, all white hair, probably in their 70s,
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.680]   75.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:52.120]   And what they do is they get into a big room and then they would have two, three key people
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.120]   present papers.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.880]   Now, everything, I was just a first year, you know, seminary student.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:01.240]   So even though I was an undergrad Bible major, I didn't know enough Greek and Hebrew to understand
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.920]   the discussion they were having.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:08.120]   And so we're listening and I'm just all by, by just the room, you know, this room was
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.160]   filled with people that all the names that you see on commentaries are all gathered in
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.600]   that room, about 500 of them.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.600]   I'm sitting in the back.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   I'm like, wow.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:20.280]   You know, for me, it's like, you know, these are my celebrities that I'm looking at.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.520]   Everybody that I, I've been reading about and talking about, writing papers about, they're
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.720]   all sitting in this room.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.240]   Well, a guy named Dr. Pinnock comes up and he presents a paper.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.880]   And I had no idea what he was talking about.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.040]   I mean, it was just going over my head, you know, I was like, that sounds good.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.680]   And I was just like, yeah, all right.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.960]   You know, awesome.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:42.360]   But after he finished this paper, they have a Q and A session afterward and they had two
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.640]   mics set up in a large room.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.680]   And as soon as it was over, you could see that there was, everybody was getting up and
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.680]   getting into this line.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.640]   It's like maybe about 30, 40 in this line, 30, 40 in this line.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.920]   And everybody wanted to get a crack at him.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.880]   And that's when I knew something was going on.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.460]   So initially I thought, oh, maybe this is just the way it is.
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:03.280]   Maybe that's just, they just have lively discussion and they say, oh, this is really cool.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.080]   And then I heard what was happening and basically they were attacking him.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:13.960]   You know, Dr. Pinnock, you know, if you do this and basically his, his thesis was addressing
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.400]   this issue.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:21.920]   If God is fair, if he is a loving God that we say he is, it would not be just for him
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.240]   to judge people who've never heard the gospel.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.240]   And so basically just like what we're talking about, God being impartial.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.000]   So he took what he thought was just and right and good and loving, and he applied it to
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.400]   God and God didn't fit, at least the way that he's, that the traditional theology that we
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.400]   have.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:44.560]   So therefore he said, since I can't say that God is not just, in order to be just, he has
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.120]   to give an opportunity for all people to hear the gospel.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:54.800]   So his, his thesis was God, he's taken a path in 1st Timothy, 1st Peter, chapter 3, 18, that
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:37:00.360]   when people who've never heard the gospel, they die, that Jesus goes to this place and
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.960]   he preaches the gospel to them.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:08.080]   And so people who are alive will be judged by rejecting the gospel when they're alive.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:12.240]   But the people who died, didn't hear the gospel will be judged based upon the gospel they
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.480]   heard from Jesus.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.240]   Now right away you can see a problem with that.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.240]   Okay.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.640]   Then we should stop preaching the gospel.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:28.480]   Because if Jesus could have preached the gospel, wouldn't you want Jesus to preach the gospel?
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.280]   We're committing tremendous sin by sending missionaries out to the remotest part of the
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.280]   world.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:40.720]   Even John Piper, John MacArthur, all the Johns, if they all got together and, and decided
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:46.840]   to be missionaries in a country, they can't come even close that Jesus himself preaching
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.440]   the gospel to the dead people.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.260]   So we should stop preaching the gospel.
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.640]   We should stop planting churches.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.320]   We should stop having small groups.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.520]   We should stop it.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.960]   If that's the case, but that was his presentation.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.800]   I mean, it was a broad, and even to this day, it was like what, 27, 28 years ago, even to
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.240]   this day, they talk about that particular event, you know, Dr. Pinnock did this and,
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.760]   and that created this whole openness of God theology.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.960]   Again, I'm not going to get into all of that.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.000]   That's where it was sparked.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.120]   Again, it's because he was projecting his sense of justice to God.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.280]   He was twisting the scripture to say, to make it fit what he thinks is just.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:35.480]   What Paul says here, again, you know, whenever we come to a passage like this, and if you,
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:40.440]   if you've ever, you know, studied through this, he mentions the word law about 20, you
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.520]   know, 20 some times.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.920]   So you may, you may get lost in these laws.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:50.680]   You know, it's a law, law, law, law, law, law, law, law, boast, law, law, law, boast,
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:58.320]   law, law, law, law, boast, circumcision, uncircumcision, law, circumcision, law, uncircumcision, law.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.760]   That's probably what you may remember from this passage, right?
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.660]   Because it's confusing.
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:07.640]   Because some of these, some of these profound questions are found in these passages.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.840]   It may be difficult to understand, but what does Paul say?
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:15.000]   Well, he dealt with the Jews who had the law, but the second part in verse 14, he says,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.440]   "For when Gentiles who do not have the law by nature do what the law requires, they are
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.720]   a law to themselves."
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:26.040]   So in other words, the Gentiles have, they don't have the written law, but they do have
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.040]   the law.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.040]   And how do you see that?
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.800]   Because they're able to determine what is right and what is wrong.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.360]   They're able to determine that.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:38.860]   And that's why when we look at all the religions, like some people say, and they listen to Christianity
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:43.660]   superficially, it's like, "Oh yeah, you know, the Buddhists and Christians and, you know,
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:48.160]   Mormons and Hindus and Muslims, they're all the same because they teach the same moral
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.160]   law."
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.160]   Right?
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.480]   Superficially.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:56.820]   And the reason why the moral law sounds the same from religion to religion is because there
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:02.280]   is one lawgiver who created all of us.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.360]   And the difference is we may have the special revelation from God's word in the gospel,
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.880]   but it's a general revelation.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:14.680]   He says, "The same creator who created you, created them and created people out there."
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:22.240]   So he says, "There is a law that every human being, that they have in their hearts, that
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:26.360]   and they say, they show that the works of the law is written on their hearts while their
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.280]   conscience also bears witness."
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   Right?
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.360]   Because it bothers their conscience when they're wrong.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:36.800]   So every single culture, I've never seen a culture with all the different places that
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:44.400]   I've been to where murdering is considered good, where lying is completely acceptable,
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.800]   where dishonoring your mother and father is seen as a good thing.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.440]   There's a universal law that no matter what religion, no matter what your background,
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.600]   no matter what age, that every human being has.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:04.200]   And so therefore he says, "And their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them."
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:09.080]   I know that you probably heard this argument that we should not legislate morality.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.400]   It is not possible.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:15.400]   It is not possible to not legislate morality.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:20.920]   Every law is based upon some moral thought that somebody has.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.960]   So whether it's a Christian view or Muslim view or somebody, there is some morality based
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.960]   in that.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.080]   So he says, "How do you determine right or wrong?
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:34.040]   How do you determine if what they're doing is wrong and this is right and this is wrong?"
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:41.840]   He says, "That in and of itself tells us that the law giver is a universal giver that governs
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.920]   all of us."
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.680]   Whenever you've gotten to get into an argument or discussion with a non-Christian about the
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.880]   existence of God, there's several arguments that you may get into.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.880]   Thomas Aquinas is probably the father of modern day apologetics.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:02.160]   And I'm not going to go through all of them, but he has the cause and effect argument.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.120]   He has the ontological argument.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.200]   He has the divine designer argument.
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.760]   He has the moved and unmoved argument.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.760]   So he has a bunch of arguments.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:16.440]   But one of the arguments that I tend to, it seems like this discussion since it always
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.680]   kind of leads to, is the moral argument.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.840]   The universal moral.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:26.440]   How do you determine what is right or what is wrong without a universal standard that
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.040]   we all agree on?
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:33.600]   A typical answer that you'll get is, "Well, morality comes from majority of the culture.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:37.520]   So at that generation, that's what they believe and so that's what they do, but morality changes."
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:43.440]   Well, if that's the case, how are we to judge the people over there in the Middle East?
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.440]   How do we judge that?
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:47.440]   Because we're not talking about a few people living in caves.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.440]   We're talking about millions of people who completely differ with some of the things
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.040]   that we believe.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:43:01.680]   In fact, during the Holocaust, we all say, "Oh, Hitler killed six million people."
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.080]   Hitler could not kill six million people.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.080]   One person killed six million people.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:11.240]   The Nazis killed six million people.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.760]   Nazis couldn't do it themselves either.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.840]   It was because there was hatred toward the Jews all over the world.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.080]   And they tapped into that hatred.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:25.920]   So yes, Hitler was the most culpable, and the Nazis, and the German people, but it wasn't
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.160]   just a few people who killed six million people.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:34.560]   It was a majority of people in that generation who was convinced and they gave into their
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.440]   fear, they gave into their hatred, and that's what happened.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.720]   In fact, if you look at human history, in every part of human history, whether it's
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:46.920]   10,000 years ago or modern history, there is some form of genocide.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.160]   There's some form of genocide.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.280]   How do we determine if that's right or wrong, if there is no universal rule that governs
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.280]   all of us?
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.720]   And that's what Paul is saying.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.480]   So let me conclude what he's saying.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:03.680]   Basically what Paul is saying is, you are not judged because you rejected Christ.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:11.240]   All men and all women are judged based upon his own personal sins.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:15.320]   Whether you had the law, whether you didn't have the law, whether you were born a thousand
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:19.800]   years ago, whether you were born today, whether you are rich or whether you are poor, whether
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:25.920]   you are a moral person or you consider yourself an immoral person, the perfect judge judges
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.520]   all of us impartially, perfectly.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.760]   And that's the point that Paul is getting at.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:36.080]   Whether you heard the gospel or didn't hear the gospel, all have sinned and fall short
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.160]   of the glory of God.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:44.160]   There is not a single person who will receive eternal judgment unfairly before God.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.880]   Every judgment that you and I will face will be perfectly fair because God sees who we
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.880]   are.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.880]   God sees what we have done in secret.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:59.040]   Even all the violations, all the evil thoughts, all the hurtful things that we've said, all
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:06.600]   the people that we've hated, every time we lusted, every time we gave in to our hatred,
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:11.840]   every time we exaggerated, every time we lied, every time we dishonored our parents, all
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:15.440]   of that before a holy judge will be revealed.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:23.320]   So when we stand before this holy judge, there's not a single person who will stand innocent.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.280]   Now if I had ended the sermon here, I mean, that'd be great, right?
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:32.240]   Let's go play some, you know, go to sports day, we'll have some fun, eat some El Anel,
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.240]   awesome, right?
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:37.880]   But the point of what he's saying here is not to just bring you down to the ground and
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:41.400]   it's like, all right, let's go, right?
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:46.360]   Because because we're studying the passage from piece to piece, you know, we're, this
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.160]   is what we're studying, so we're there.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.360]   But we have to understand what is his whole point?
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:56.200]   What is, what is the goal of Paul and why does he say it?
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.880]   He's saying what he's saying in order to get to, get us to the same place that Paul gets
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.000]   to in Romans chapter 7, 24.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.840]   Remember that passage in 7, 24 where you see a man just wrestling with his sin, what I
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.020]   want to do, I don't do, what I don't want to do, I keep doing.
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:14.960]   And then what does he say in conclusion with this wrestling with his sin, it takes him
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.960]   to a place in verse 24, it says, "Oh, what a wretched man I am.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.160]   Who will deliver me from this body of death?
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.240]   Oh, what a wretched man I am."
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:29.560]   That's the point that Paul is trying to get to in Romans chapter 1, 2, and 3.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.080]   See that's the beginning of salvation.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:37.220]   Beginning of salvation is not, God is wonderful, he's so loving, I want some of that.
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:42.840]   The beginning of salvation is when we recognize the same thing Paul recognizes in Romans chapter
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.480]   7, "Oh, what a wretched man that I am.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   If I was to stand before God today by my own merit, oh, what a wretched man that I am.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.280]   I am a man of unclean lips from a people of unclean lips.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.440]   I am undone, I am ruined."
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.920]   And when we see, basically what God is doing, He's examining our hearts, examining who we
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:09.440]   are, examining what we deserve, and He gives a long list of, "Here's your sins."
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:17.560]   And you come to the realization, "How can I possibly make up for this?
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:23.960]   How can I possibly take this before a judge and think that somehow I'm going to find leniency?
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:27.600]   Oh, what a wretched man that I am."
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:32.560]   And when we're at that point, that's when Paul says in chapter 8 verse 1, "Therefore
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.520]   there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:40.280]   Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord for what the law of the spirit of life
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:45.560]   set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death, that our God will no longer
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.600]   judge us based upon what we deserve."
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:55.840]   And that's why he says in the gospel, "Righteousness of God is revealed.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.760]   Your righteousness, my righteousness, looks like what we just saw."
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.900]   This is what our righteousness will look like in the presence of God.
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.640]   Those who have the law, those who do not have the law.
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.180]   Those who are privileged, those who are not privileged.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.980]   Those who have good grades, those who have bad grades.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:16.720]   Those who are moral, and those who think that they're immoral.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.880]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:25.920]   Every single one of us, when we recognize who God truly is, in light of who He is and
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:32.320]   we recognize who we are, God brings us to a point of humility.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.640]   And that's the beginning of salvation.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   That's the beginning.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:44.420]   Is when we see Christ in light of our sins, and we come to the cross not as an option,
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:48.080]   but the only way that I can live.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:51.120]   And that's when the gospel becomes powerful.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:57.840]   That's when in light of this great mercy, we offer our lives as a living sacrifice.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:03.120]   So again, as Paul continues to remind us, and we're not done yet, right?
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.840]   We're right in the thick of things, and we're going to keep pounding through his message
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.080]   of what the law means and how it indicts us.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:14.320]   And again, as we're studying all this, let's always keep in mind why he's saying this.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.640]   Why he said, why Jesus said what he said to this rich young man.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.320]   He says, "Because he loved him."
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.460]   He said, "If you think this the way, you keep going.
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.880]   See where this leads you, so that he may turn to Christ."
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.400]   That we would recognize this in the same way.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:32.400]   This is God's loving revelation for us.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.680]   To humble us, so that we would recognize who He is.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.920]   Let's take a few minutes to pray as we ask our team to come up.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:45.920]   As they lead us in a time of worship, again, I encourage you to take some time to pray.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:49.360]   Before you pray for your circumstance, before you pray for other people, let's take some
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.360]   time to come before the Lord and pray.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:57.040]   And then maybe we don't recognize our sin the way that it really is in the presence
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.040]   of God.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:02.960]   That you come before the Lord and say, "God, open my eyes, that I may see who I am as I
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.620]   really am.
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:09.240]   And then, so that I can see how I am to you."
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.400]   And so take some time to pray.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:15.480]   Let's pray for our own hearts, pray for our own revelation, and that we will be true worshipers
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.400]   as these things are revealed to us.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.320]   So let's take some time to pray.
