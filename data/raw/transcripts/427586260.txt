[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   - Hello, everyone.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.600]   For tonight's Bible study, we're going to be studying Ephesians chapter 5, verses 7
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.800]   through 14, and continuing on the command and challenge for us to walk worthy of the
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.080]   gospel, to walk in the image of God, and tonight it's going to be to walk as children of light.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.040]   Before we take the time to dive into the study, let's take a moment to pray, ask for the Lord's
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.520]   blessing on our study.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.360]   Our God, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.360]   Lord, each week we're grateful for the precious word that we receive.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.640]   We recognize that throughout history, your saints have seen your word for what it is,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.680]   that God, your word is a light unto our feet, and God, that as it dwells within us, as it
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.960]   produces in us the effect and the fruit that you desire, God, that you call us to shine
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.960]   this light.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.880]   I pray, Father God, that we would be walking then, walking according to your truth, that
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.280]   God, we would be able to apply in all the different facets of our lives, Lord.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.880]   Thank you for this time of study and pray that God, again, thoroughly and deeply, you
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.360]   would continue to change us.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.440]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.440]   Amen.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.440]   Okay.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.040]   So, if you would follow with me as I read chapter five, starting from verse one.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.600]   It's good sometimes just to review the sections before us, because there's so much in there,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.600]   but particularly today, because you recognize that the two paragraphs really flow one to
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.600]   another.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.720]   So, let's take a moment to read.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.680]   It says, "Therefore, be imitators of God as beloved children, and walk in love just as
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.160]   Christ also loved you and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.200]   as a flagrant, fragrant aroma.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.400]   But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you as is proper among
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.760]   saints.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.120]   And there must be no filthiness and silly talk or coarse jesting which are not fitting,
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.040]   but rather giving of thanks.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.680]   For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man who
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.280]   is an idolater has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.320]   Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things, the wrath of God
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.640]   comes upon the sons of disobedience.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.840]   Therefore, do not be partakers with them."
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.540]   Verse eight, "For you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the world.
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.000]   Walk as children of light, for the fruit of light consists in all goodness and righteousness
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.620]   and truth, trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.200]   Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.440]   For it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret, but
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.920]   all things become visible when they are exposed by the light.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.840]   For everything that becomes visible is light.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.560]   For this reason it says, 'Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.560]   on you.'"
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.560]   Okay?
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.240]   So as we recall, there were some really emphatic commands for us to abide by.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.760]   And the way that I talked about them in the previous Bible studies are that these are
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.280]   broad categorical commands, right?
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.760]   And then underneath them were very specific applications.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.960]   Whether it be the idea for us to walk worthy of the calling, and that was emphasized to
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.440]   us, then to walk in love, patience and humility, and pursuing unity.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.080]   What's more, to imitate God as children.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.400]   Then again, to walk in love, and then also to make sure that we're putting off certain
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.040]   things that were of our former selves.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.400]   Likewise, categorically tonight, he's going to challenge us, the scripture's going to
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.600]   challenge us to walk as children of light.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.560]   The way that I like to outline our passage today is in three sections.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.600]   Okay?
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:16.880]   And sometimes the sections don't go as clearly, but what I observed were the commands for
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.560]   us to not partake, but to walk in the light.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.200]   And then a repeated command, essentially saying the same thing, but giving a different rationale,
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.840]   saying don't partake, but rather expose it in the light.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.480]   And then verse 14, giving us a gospel call to wake up as the light of Christ shines.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.520]   So as we take a look at our passage, I do want to highlight that there is such a flow
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.280]   of thought that continued from the beginning of chapter five into this section.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.840]   And you'll notice as I highlight these key terms where it says, therefore do this, or
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.840]   more specifically here, therefore don't do this, right?
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.560]   To not be partakers.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.440]   And then it says for your formerly darkness.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.360]   And what's more in verse nine, for the fruit of light consists of these.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.160]   And then in verse 12, for it is disgraceful even to speak.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:14.040]   So what I observed and noticed within that portion was that within the context, there
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.800]   are commands and there are rationales.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   Okay?
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   Commands and rationales.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.960]   So by way of observation, I want to highlight those things.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.520]   And let's first talk about the command.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.520]   Okay?
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.880]   The command for us here is to not be partakers with them.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.400]   Previously he was talking about those who are immoral, impure, greedy, covetous, and
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.760]   idolatrous people.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.840]   Previously he said, because for certain you know that the wrath of God is going to come.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.240]   And all those who are disobedient are going to be judged by God.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.240]   Right?
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.440]   That's the way that Apostle Paul framed last week's teaching or that section.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.600]   Okay?
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.880]   Here Apostle Paul reiterates and says, if you know these things, right?
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.840]   If you know that the wrath of God is coming, then make sure you're not partakers with them.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.520]   Now by way of just looking up the idea of what does it mean to be a partaker?
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.480]   Does that mean just like avoid them?
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.080]   Don't even walk near them?
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.160]   Should we go as far as maybe, you know, the Jews of old who are like, I'm not even going
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.320]   to walk near their city.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.240]   Like what should we be thinking?
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.960]   Well, in terms of just a pure definition, it's talking about a partnership.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.800]   It's talking about an associate who has essentially, if you think of an associate of a company,
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.760]   associate even as a individual who's working for the same sale, for the same cause or the
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.920]   purpose, that kind of idea.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.080]   But I want to highlight some other passages because you know that the scriptures actually
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.880]   talk about this quite a bit in terms of walking with the world, friendship with the world.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.520]   There's so much to say.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.880]   Now I'd like to highlight just two passages here.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.480]   The first one comes from Psalm chapter one and it says this, "Blessed is the man who
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:05.640]   walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.440]   the seat of scoffers, but his delight is in the law of the Lord and on his law he meditates
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.440]   day and night.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.400]   He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season and its
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.960]   leaf does not wither.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.000]   In all that he does, he prospers.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away."
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.520]   I want to ask you, when you think about do not be partakers with them, if you're thinking
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.200]   so long as I don't fulfill their actions, so long as I don't do exactly as they do,
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.720]   are you not partakers with them?
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:47.040]   Well here in wisdom, right, the book of Psalms challenges us not to sit there underneath
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.880]   their counsel, not to stand there with them, and not to sit with them in scoffers.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.960]   And there's like a progression as you walk and be a part of their whole mentality and
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.960]   worldview.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.960]   Here's another interesting passage.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.360]   First Corinthians chapter five, verse nine through 11.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.640]   "I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.000]   I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world or with the covetous and swindlers
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.200]   or with idolaters, for then you would have to go out of the world."
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.080]   So one might say, well, Jesus dined with sinners.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.440]   Very true, right?
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.840]   Jesus ministered to the lost.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.480]   Jesus was found to be talking with an adulterous woman.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.040]   Jesus was found ministering together with former tax collectors.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.960]   I mean, you think about individuals who are sinners, can you be in their proximity?
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.080]   The answer is yes, otherwise you would have to go out, right, into the wilderness or something.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.560]   But verse 11 says, "But actually I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:51.920]   if he is an immoral person or covetous, an idolater or reviler or a drunkard or a swindler,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.320]   not even to eat with such a one."
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.560]   So I want you to think about that.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:03.840]   We have to have a kind of growing understanding of what apostle Paul wants us to do.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.960]   And there is this idea, it's first and foremost, he says, you understand where they're headed,
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.960]   right?
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.120]   That's exactly what he was previously saying.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.720]   You have these individuals who are living by their desires, living by what they believe
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.840]   is right, living by their own greed, and what you know for certain is where they're headed
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.440]   and how God views that.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.240]   I don't want you condoning anything that is pertaining to what God disapproves of, what
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.360]   God is going to judge and pour His wrath on.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.200]   And so I want you to also think about this.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.640]   Yes, it's true, you can be in close proximity, but when you think about Christ, his intentionality
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:46.040]   for why he would be in proximity with individuals, it's very different from this generation.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.840]   What's more, when you think about this passage in 1 Corinthians 5, there is clearly this
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:57.040]   adamant, I guess, admonition that if you just simply walk with individuals who are so-called
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.560]   brothers who are supposed to be walking in the light, and yet you act and walk with them
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.800]   as though everything is okay, that is in fact not okay.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.480]   You can't give any kind of credence to their lifestyle if they're called a so-called brother.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.480]   There has to be consequences, essentially.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.760]   There has to be ramifications for the fact that they live in such a manner.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.440]   Okay, now, one of the things, again, that I was trying to highlight for you earlier
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.800]   by showing you the therefores and the fores was that this passage was chock full of rationales.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.640]   The why.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:40.080]   Why am I supposed to have that kind of clarity between me and the individuals of the world?
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.680]   Why am I supposed to have that kind of clear distinction?
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:49.260]   Are we supposed to be drawing lines and creating boundaries within the world between Christians
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.760]   and non-Christians?
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:57.720]   May I say from the beginning, whether we see it or not, there is already a massive divide
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.480]   between those who are called by Christ and those who are not.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.760]   Not in any kind of arrogant or self-righteous way.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.080]   It is the state of spiritual reality, right?
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:15.840]   Here, rationale one, it says, "For you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.880]   the world."
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.680]   Here is a motivation as to why we're not supposed to be particulars with them.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.000]   As a matter of fact, again, the passage is chock full of them and I numbered them here.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.160]   When you guys see a pattern or a list, I recommend that you take a moment to list all the things
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.160]   that are there.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.520]   "For you were formerly darkness, but now you are light.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.680]   For the fruit of light consists of all goodness, righteousness, and truth.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.120]   For it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.880]   For everything that becomes visible is light."
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:56.640]   What I'm going to do now is take those motivations and highlight them for you.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:03.640]   Motivation number one, the dark to light transformation is your identity.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.080]   The dark to light transformation is your identity.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.320]   He tells you what you were formerly and what you are now.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.000]   The whole of that is your identity.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.840]   When you look at your past and you're super discouraged, that is not the whole of your
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.840]   identity.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.000]   Your identity includes everything about who you were and who you are now.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.840]   It's not as though because we're emphasizing who we are now that everything about the past
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.440]   becomes completely, completely forgotten.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.360]   No, we remember the fallenness.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.800]   We recall the pits from which Christ has saved us.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:51.000]   All of that to us then is a powerful identity where we can say, "We are the transformed.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.400]   We are the renewed."
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.560]   If you recall that contrast, we're supposed to actually, I guess, appreciate.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.600]   The longer we live, we're supposed to be able to see in more grand picture, "Oh my goodness,
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.040]   look how far I was from God.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.580]   Look how deserving I was of His judgment.
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:14.640]   Look how utterly incapable, utterly impossible it was for me to attain to anything, to fix
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.640]   anything.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.920]   Look how great His grace is."
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.760]   That kind of divide, we're supposed to appreciate more and more as we live.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.760]   Why?
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.560]   Because that contrast shows to us a great, great powerful motivation as to why we need
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.200]   to be all the more walking in the light.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.840]   That contrast, he shows us by describing the fruit of righteousness, or sorry, fruit of
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.720]   light, which is righteousness.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.320]   The fruit of light of righteousness.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.800]   The way that he says it is, "The fruit of light consists of these, all goodness, righteousness,
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   and truth."
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.920]   What are we saying here?
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:55.240]   What he's talking about is the various things that we want, greater good, greater righteousness
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.680]   in the world, greater adherence to truth.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.240]   All of these things come from being in the light.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.280]   It doesn't come from just simply having positions of power.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.560]   It doesn't come from using our intellect.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.400]   It comes from being in the light of Christ.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.520]   It comes from the Lord.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.840]   One of the challenges I want to give to you is this, when we think about the things that
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.920]   we engage in, whether it be the context of our home, whether it be, let's say, difficult
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.480]   scenarios, let's say in marriage, whether it be situations and circumstances at work
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:33.600]   where it's all tricky and dicey, I want you to ask this question, "What am I trying to
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   accomplish?
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.960]   What fruit am I trying to grow?"
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:43.520]   Because we have this tendency to get so distracted with wanting a specific, I guess, outcome,
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.520]   a goal.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:50.240]   Like we're anticipating a certain kind of circumstance that we would like to see.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.280]   And sometimes it just gets us so, so distracted.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.600]   One of the ways by which we can continue to test, "Are we walking in the light?" is by
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.200]   using this.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.920]   It's both a motivation and essentially a test for us.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.440]   It's motivation because the only way to righteousness, as we were talking about this past Sunday,
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.440]   is the light.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.560]   But what's more, to check to see if we are in the light, we should be asking, "What is
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.880]   it that I actually want to accomplish?"
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.760]   Now, I've said to myself before, I don't want to necessarily use my children too much as
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:29.800]   an example, but yesterday night I was just at home and little Emmett came up and he was
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.720]   trying to tell me, "Oh, Abba.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.240]   Yoshi and I, Heng and I, we were messing around and then his foot smacked my face and left
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.240]   my nose all runny."
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.760]   Now, Yoshi came running over and he was all scared.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.240]   So he was like, "No, it's not true."
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.240]   And I was like, "What?
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.240]   What's not true?
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.240]   Your foot did it in his face?"
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.240]   He was like, "No.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.160]   He's just trying to get me in trouble.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.160]   I didn't mean to."
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.840]   And he was defending himself.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.160]   And he was coming at me.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.880]   And I remember thinking, "Whoa, whoa, hold on.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.880]   All Emmett said was that you guys were horsing around.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.880]   You're not in trouble sometimes.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.080]   You guys horse around and you guys get hurt.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.080]   Nobody's in trouble."
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   And he's like, "No, but that's not what happened."
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.080]   And I was like, "What?
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080]   Stop.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.880]   Like, Emmett didn't say that you were a bad, bad man.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.920]   He was just saying that your foot smacked you in the face, right?
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.240]   I mean, smacked him in the face."
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.920]   And he just kept coming at me like he's trying to defend himself.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.920]   And I was just like, "Stop."
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.480]   And I started giggling and laughing.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.760]   I was like, "What are you doing?
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.800]   If your point is I shouldn't be in trouble, you're not in trouble.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.600]   The reality is you're not in trouble."
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.360]   And I started laughing at him.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.120]   And then all of a sudden he realized like, "Okay, why are you laughing?"
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.240]   And I just asked him, "What's the reality?
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.680]   The reality is your foot smacked him in the face.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.280]   Also the reality is you're not in trouble.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.160]   What are you arguing about?"
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.840]   And then we just started laughing together because he was like, "Okay."
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.560]   But the fear, like the goal was I don't want to be in trouble.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.560]   I don't deserve this, right?
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.400]   The fear of, "Oh my goodness, my brother's going to tattle-tale and he's going to get
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.360]   me in trouble because he's going to lie," or something like that.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:13.720]   The fear to try to preemptively protect himself caused him to argue with me pointlessly.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:19.920]   And I wanted him to see that like, "Listen, think about what you're trying to accomplish.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.080]   You're just trying to accomplish like, 'I better know what happened.'"
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.360]   Like you weren't even listening to what I was saying.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:32.260]   And so I realized sometimes even in like marriage conflict, even in like workplace scenario,
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.160]   if your goal is like, "You know, I just need to speak my piece."
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.800]   Like, if your goal is like, "I just want to make sure I get due credit for this."
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.680]   Like, think about the fruit.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.880]   Is the fruit goodness?
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.560]   Is the fruit more honesty?
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.120]   Is the fruit like better mutual understanding?
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.280]   Like, are you listening?
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.840]   Is the fruit more righteousness between the two of us?
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.400]   Like, is the fruits greater joy?
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.160]   Is the fruit like greater working together in harmony for the good of the company?
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.080]   So that, you know, yes, we're going to try to, you know, sell more products and do good
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.320]   for the public too, right?
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.520]   Like whatever it may be, we want to provide good services, whatever it may be.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.240]   Are you actually producing good?
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.920]   Or is the fruit actually destructive?
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.560]   Is the fruit just for yourself?
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.440]   And that's why later on in verse 11, this passage says the deeds of darkness is not
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.040]   like heinously vile.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.040]   You know what it says?
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.240]   The deeds of darkness is unfruitful.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:32.480]   Like there's such vanity wrapped up in thinking like the world and pursuing the world's objectives.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.440]   And so we have to ask, what kind of fruits are we producing with what we are engaging
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.440]   in?
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:44.360]   What's more, motivation number three, why should we not partake in the darkness, but
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:50.240]   continue to walk in greater light is because the fruits of darkness is actually disgraceful.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.240]   Okay.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.040]   Meaning there's shame.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.040]   Okay.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:59.640]   Definitions wise, that the term for disgraceful is dishonorable, act indecent, completely
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:06.000]   inappropriate or used in another context in one of the first Timothy passage about elders
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.520]   looking for sword gain.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.000]   It's inappropriate, dishonest gain.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Okay.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.280]   And what I'd like to highlight here is the scriptures essentially tell you that the deeds
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.440]   of darkness is shameful.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.800]   Okay.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   And the fact of the matter is I do believe scripture has challenged every single one
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   of us.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.200]   Now, when you are a Christian, you are exposed to the light and you have greater insight
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.240]   as to what things are actually appropriate.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.900]   When we are not in the light, we're like kids.
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.440]   We have no idea what's appropriate or not.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.640]   You know, when little kids, they just come out there and they're like, Oh, look at my
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.640]   shirt.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.120]   They just take off their shirt and expose themselves.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.720]   And the parents are like, Oh no, you know, shame.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:51.440]   You got to have some sense when we are outside of Christ, essentially when we're outside
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.000]   of even, especially even the Christian community.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.240]   Sometimes I like to call it the, I'm buff in my own room syndrome.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.520]   I've used this analogy a lot.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.640]   When you are kind of confined to your own space in your own room, certain things seem
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.840]   so because of like scale so different.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.000]   When you're in your own room, you flex in front of that mirror.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.960]   You look huge, right?
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.480]   When you're in front of your closet door and then your room is only like a 10 by 10 room
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.560]   and you just like flexing, you're like, Oh, I'm huge.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.560]   Right?
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.080]   You go out into the world and you realize, you know what?
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.480]   I'm actually below average.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.880]   You're just a lot smaller than a lot of people.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.640]   But if we're not exposed to the Christian community and what's more actually exposed
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.160]   to the light of Christ, our frame of reference is always off.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.840]   Our scaling is all off.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.840]   Right?
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.760]   And so what ends up happening is we don't know what's appropriate.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:46.560]   What's more scripture actually rebukes people through all generations because sometimes
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.600]   their reaction to shame is one of two things.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.440]   One is to take their kind of guilt and shame radar and just be like pounded to the ground.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.160]   But like, I'm not going to feel guilty about this.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.160]   I'll do what I want.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.160]   Right?
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.440]   Like that's one reaction.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.520]   The other reaction is to just keep hiding deeper and deeper into your hole because your
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.480]   shame just grows.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.240]   Either way, it's not good.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.280]   And here's an interesting passage from scripture from Jeremiah chapter six, verse 15, where
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:16.120]   it says, "Were they ashamed because of the abomination they have done?
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.360]   They were not even ashamed at all.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.160]   They did not even know how to blush.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.080]   Therefore, they shall fall among those who fall.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:28.020]   At the time that I punish them, they shall be cast down, says the Lord."
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:32.040]   It is actually a good thing to know appropriate shame.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.640]   It is a good thing to know what is appropriate honor.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.520]   It's a good thing to know when to blush before God.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:45.200]   And so I have to just kind of take a moment to say, whenever you feel shame, don't just
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.480]   always spurn that off as like, "Oh, it's because people are judgmental."
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.480]   Right?
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.840]   You have to take a moment to ask like, "Why is there shame?"
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:22:00.520]   And if shame is used for things that are tangibly real, truthful, honest, things were actually
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:06.960]   intended to grow, then you must actually respond appropriately to that with humility, with
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.520]   a learner spirit, with a desire to grow and mature.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:16.880]   Shame will cause us to actually move towards proper restraint, greater self-control.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.360]   It typically leads us down thinking through the eyes, right?
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.520]   The eyes of those who are watching us.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.800]   And it's actually helpful if we're thinking about the right way.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.280]   Essentially, we're thinking about the eyes of God and we're thinking about the eyes of
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.600]   the people we love within the church community, within the family of God.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.600]   Right?
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:44.880]   So the other thing is, I think sometimes, because I'm a pastor, I do recognize that
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.360]   those two responses come out a lot.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.840]   There are moments when some people, just because I'm a pastor, this just happened to the other
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.440]   day, because I'm a pastor, one of my neighbors just kind of started confessing like the stuff
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.140]   that they did.
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:04.440]   When I see that, I mean, I don't want to be a source of shame for people, but in some
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:13.060]   sense, if they think that I am like a standard, like I'm thinking of an individual who holds
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.160]   holy standards and therefore they need to correct themselves in front of me, is that
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.160]   a bad thing?
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.160]   I don't think so.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.080]   I actually think that's a good thing.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.480]   But on the flip side, if you look at me and you're just like, "Oh, I don't want to be
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.880]   around you because you just always make me feel super self-conscious."
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.080]   Well, there are deeper issues that I think we need to deal with.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.800]   So with that just being said, in terms of shame, it's not always something to be spurned.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.060]   It can go bad.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.080]   At the same time, we have to make sure we're responding to it appropriately.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.360]   Number four motivation, which is the light of God is powerful.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.380]   The light is absolutely powerful.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:51.360]   Look at what the scripture says, "But all things become visible when they are exposed
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.960]   by the light.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.000]   There is nothing hidden from the power of the word of God."
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.040]   Scripture talks about in Psalm 19, that essentially the revelation of God goes forth and it's
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.720]   like the sun, just hits everything.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:10.360]   And though yes, you may be trying to hide in the tunnel, even the tunnels, even the
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.680]   tunnels are affected by the warmth of the sun.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.640]   The light of God, it shines and it affects and it's powerful.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.320]   And so I want you to think, when we talk about conflict resolution in your home, in your
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:29.400]   family, some of the toughest things, sometimes we're arguing from hurt and darkness.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.880]   And what needs to happen in order to work this out is that there has to be the revelation
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.400]   and the light of God.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.760]   Okay?
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:43.920]   So I want us to think through these things and think about those motivations.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.920]   Why?
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.200]   Please take a moment to think with me here.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:53.160]   It's not like, "Oh, you know, once in a while I'm tempted with evil, darkness.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.280]   Am I once in a while tempted with lust?
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.280]   No.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.160]   Am I once in a while tempted with greed?
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.160]   No.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.020]   I am very frequently inundated with, 'Want this, buy this.
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.380]   You don't have enough money.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.320]   You should get, you know, you should, if you have money to buy this and this, you'd be
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.320]   so happy.'"
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.880]   Like that kind of temptation is all around us.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.200]   Whether it be selfishness, self-preservation, self-promotion, pride, all of these things
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.720]   are immoral because it's twisted.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:24.840]   I shouldn't be a prideful man if I know who I am before God, who I was, now transformed
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.800]   to the newness, into the new life of Christ, right?
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.040]   All those things are perverse.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:36.360]   For a man to constantly lust after more and more women, that's all perverse.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.800]   Those temptations are all around us.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.800]   Question for you.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:46.320]   Do you feel like you have power, motivation, strength from the inside to fight those things?
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:51.800]   And then my question would be, were you able in certain moments of your temptation to express
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.800]   why?
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:00.180]   What rationale would you have to choose to walk in light?
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.560]   Have you ever said, "You know what?
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.760]   That's not me anymore because I'm a redeemed person.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.320]   I'm a transformed person."
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.320]   Right?
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.440]   Did you ever say, "You know what?
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.440]   The light is powerful.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.920]   Even though in my tiny little room, I think I can get away with this.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.040]   The light of God is powerful.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.480]   He sees all."
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.480]   Right?
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:25.360]   Like, has that powerful truth affected the way you face temptation?
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.000]   And again, these things are not just passing truths.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.640]   These are things that are, I guess you could just say, they're real.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.640]   These are real things.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.360]   And so I want to challenge you.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:44.320]   It's good for us to rehearse these great truths that stand for us as strength.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.560]   It's good for us to continue walking in the light.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.560]   Okay?
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.040]   Now let's talk about this command.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.720]   The command is a combination in verse 8 and verse 10.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.720]   Right?
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.640]   The command is, "Walk as children of light."
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.780]   And then he adds, "Trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord."
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:07.640]   So the growth pattern, the maturity should be, you are walking as a child of God, imitating
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.640]   Him.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:14.000]   And because God is your source, because God is your strength, because God is your everything,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.040]   you as His child, you're resembling that light, that glory.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   And in that, you're constantly trying to understand the heart of God and His will, what is pleasing
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.120]   to Him.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:30.240]   If you recall, one of the things that we learned previously was a beautiful picture of when
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:37.080]   God is pleased by the aroma of self-sacrifice, because it resembles Him so much, because
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.640]   it truly shows the weight of His love.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.640]   Right?
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.040]   So you're growing in your ability to carry the burdens of the people around you, to sacrifice
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:50.760]   yourself, your energy, your time, your money, your resources, whatever it may be, the attention
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.760]   span so to speak.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.760]   Right?
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.360]   Like all of that, sacrificing for the good of the people you love, that in God's eyes
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.360]   is very pleasing.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.720]   Here's a question to you.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:08.600]   Do you understand and are you growing in your understanding and conviction that this pleases
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.600]   God?
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.800]   I have conviction to say like that right there, dishonoring to the Lord.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   I know it.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.800]   Right?
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.560]   What's more, that right there, God loves that.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:22.160]   Like, do you have a growing base of biblical understanding?
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.360]   I want to highlight a passage for you.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.840]   Scripture says, "This is the message we have heard from Him and announced to you that God
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.760]   is light and in Him there is no darkness at all.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.840]   If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.760]   practice the truth.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.960]   But if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.920]   another and the blood of Jesus, His Son, cleanses us from all sin.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:53.040]   If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us."
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.520]   I find that interesting that that passage goes together.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.600]   It pretty much reiterates the challenge, walk in the light, right?
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.960]   Because God Himself is light.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.600]   The connection is really clear.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.360]   Because God is, you have to walk appropriately.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:13.440]   But within all that, we recognize that there is this element of, there should be a growing
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.000]   then recognition because the light's been turned on.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.440]   You should be able to see sin.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.440]   Right?
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.160]   Like, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.840]   Like, are you growing in your discernment?
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.600]   Not only that, but like that right there, like if it's on you, right?
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.720]   Like that right there is sin.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.840]   That right there is sin.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.400]   You should be growing in that capacity.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.080]   Here's another thing.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.880]   I want to challenge you and ask this question to please take a moment to think about what
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.520]   is great faith.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.720]   Right?
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.120]   So the question is to think about what is great faith.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:52.800]   Now one of the things in terms of great faith that we think sometimes is where you have
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.680]   such courage, like, "Because I have faith, I'm going to stand tall.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.920]   Because I have faith, I'm going to move.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.160]   Because I have faith, I'm going to do this crazy, you know, like monetary sacrifice and
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.160]   take the risks."
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.200]   Okay?
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.400]   Your faith is going to empower you to do that.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.400]   Right?
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:11.640]   But in terms of the greatness of the faith, we don't have to overcomplicate it.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:17.360]   The greatness of the faith means that you understand God.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.320]   Right?
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:27.200]   You understand His mind because you've been wanting to know His heart.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.880]   There is this Latin term, "caram deo," which means "in the presence of God."
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:38.800]   When your awareness of God grows and you recognize what honors Him, what pleases Him, you know
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.160]   His tastes, you know His likes and dislikes basically.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:49.360]   And you're growing to know of conviction, these are the things that please God.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.520]   Essentially your faith is becoming great.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.760]   Right?
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.600]   You understand Him.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.600]   And so let me ask you, like, you know, in the later passages when we study the next
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.160]   section, he's going to talk about the submissive spirit.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.440]   You understand that what pleases God is not this, like, "I'm a powerful man.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.960]   You better recognize."
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.960]   No.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.520]   That is not actually, like, impressive to God.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:16.160]   What's very impressive to God is you know how to submit yourself.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:23.440]   When for not necessarily, like, because it's the right thing to do, but because of the
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:29.200]   wisdom, because of the intentionality and sincerity and the wealth of love in your heart,
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:35.040]   when you're able to submit yourself, your preferences, your self-interest, He says,
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.560]   "That's precious."
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:40.120]   When He talks to the ladies and He's, and He doesn't talk to, what I mean is, in 1 Peter
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:47.160]   chapter 3, He speaks to the ladies and says, "You know, this humble, meek spirit is precious
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.800]   in the sight of God."
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.000]   Right?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.680]   Do you recognize that these things, there are so many parts of Scripture that tells
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.960]   us these are the things that God delights in?
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.640]   Are those your convictions?
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.640]   Okay?
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.800]   All right.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.920]   So now, what I'd like to do is take a moment to pause and say, so far what we've seen is
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   the command.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.400]   Do not be partakers with them.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.400]   Right?
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.640]   Don't partner with them for sure.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.840]   But we also saw that it means a little bit more in the sense that when we look at systematic
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:20.760]   theology and realize there is a way in which we can behave where we operate, we follow
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:27.000]   their counsel, we take their worldview, and then we condone them and sit with them.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Right?
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.360]   And we don't want to do that.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:34.320]   And what's more, He says, "Walk as children in light," and so we're being challenged and
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:40.720]   motivated to continue to resemble God in all things related to His truth and reality.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.720]   Light typically means that there is now then an exposure, like that now that your eyes
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.880]   are open and things are illuminated so that you can distinguish.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.240]   That's where that is.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.240]   Right?
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.560]   And that's what we should be growing in.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:58.880]   Essentially, what He does is in verse 11 through 13, He repeats the same idea.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.160]   And so we're going to take less time going over it.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:06.800]   What He says is, "Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   expose them."
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   So here's the command.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:14.080]   Do not partake, but the second part of it is expose in the light.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.000]   To expose is a really commonly used term in the Bible.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.400]   It's used in lots of different scenarios, and it means to prove wrong, to refute, reprove,
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.400]   or correct.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.400]   Okay?
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.400]   So there is this very instructive, like, "That's wrong.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.200]   This is right," kind of exposing.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   Okay?
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.560]   Now, I just want to give a challenge.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.560]   Right?
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:41.080]   The unfruitful deeds of darkness, do we now become the police that essentially goes around
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.400]   and makes sure that we enforce the law?
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.520]   Well, I'm going to say yes and no.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.520]   Okay?
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:56.440]   What I mean by yes and no is the law of God is of such weight, it has to be upheld.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:01.320]   You know, sometimes I realize, like, again, I'm no crazy veteran in ministry, but having
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.640]   been in ministry for a while, you know, there are just some people I don't want to tell
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.880]   them anything is wrong because they're just dear to you.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:14.360]   You know, they themselves are soft and, like, you know, tender, and I just would feel bad
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.140]   if I said this and that kind of stuff.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.140]   And that's one challenge, right?
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:23.160]   It's like, "Ooh, the relational aspect of it, how is it sometimes going to challenge
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:29.560]   my desire to uphold the objective, universal, and everlasting standard of God?"
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.560]   Right?
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.760]   So, scripture gives us this challenge.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:38.520]   Scripture says in Galatians chapter 6, "Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass or
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:44.800]   sin, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, each one looking
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.760]   to yourself so that you too will not be tempted.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:55.260]   Bear one another's burdens and thereby fulfill the law of Christ."
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:00.480]   You know, I realize sometimes as I'm learning through this kind of stuff, that passage challenges
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.160]   us to expose, right?
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.200]   But I hope we're not thinking, like, "We need to shame people."
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:10.800]   I'm not necessarily sure that that's exactly what it's getting at.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:16.680]   Because as we think about even, let's say, like, correction and teaching, Apostle Paul
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.660]   talks about instructing people like his children, right?
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:25.120]   When we think about even the magnitude of scripture in 2 Timothy chapter 3, verse 16,
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:29.560]   how it's all God-breathed, he says, "This is good for instruction, reproof, and so forth,"
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.560]   right?
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:36.600]   And essentially then, teaching and instruction has various forms, depending on context, depending
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.680]   on what it is, and all that kind of stuff.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:44.360]   But clearly here in terms of the intent, the scriptures teaches us we need to make sure
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.320]   that we are in the business of restoring.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:51.480]   What's more, the way that we're going about it, it's not so much like, "Ha!
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.480]   Look at you!
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.480]   Look what you're doing under there!"
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.480]   Right?
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.800]   It's more like you're carrying the person's burden and thereby fulfilling the law.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   Right?
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.720]   Fulfilling the law of love.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.360]   And that's what we want to be doing.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.620]   I think for most people, this challenge is going to be kind of tough.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:14.160]   Because number one, for most people, they're already feeling kind of like, "You know this
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.520]   passage says, 'Look out for yourself because you could be tempted, right?
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.800]   You could sin too.'"
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.760]   I think for most people, they feel guilty of their own sins and they don't feel the
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.240]   right to go and rebuke somebody else.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.620]   I think that's the vast majority of people.
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.620]   And I want to give this challenge.
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.600]   We realize the scripture is challenging us.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.600]   No, no, no.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:38.920]   The weight of the Word of God is not predicated by your own track record as whether you're
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.400]   allowed to say it or not.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.400]   Right?
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.640]   The scripture is not true because you've done well.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.640]   Right?
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.000]   The scripture is true because the scripture is true.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.440]   And so what we have to do is do what this passage in Galatians is saying, is to be cautious.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:58.000]   That we're not pointing a massive accusatory finger like, "Look at what you've been doing
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   under there."
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Right?
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.880]   That's not the way that we should be doing things.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.440]   Or rather, we should be designed to restore.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:09.320]   But I do want to ask, man, if we are going to be correcting and improving, it does require
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.680]   for us to at least have a working base.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.400]   That we should have an understanding of wisdom and discernment from the scriptures.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.120]   That even if we're going to correct, that correction comes with wisdom and understanding.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.120]   Right?
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:27.360]   I think the worst thing we can be doing is making people feel like, I don't know, not
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.960]   the worst thing, but another error that we could fall into is making people feel absolutely
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.440]   guilty and messing with the consciences of people because we weren't very well informed
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.840]   about the truth, about what the scripture has to say.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.840]   Okay.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:48.320]   Lastly, in verse 14, it says, "For this reason," it says, "Awake, sleeper, and arise from the
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.880]   dead, and Christ will shine on you."
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.640]   And Christ will shine on you.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:59.440]   Now recognize that here when it says, "For this reason," this is a then conclusion statement.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.040]   It's like, it should kind of be read as, "Therefore it says," right?
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:09.440]   As opposed to, "For this reason," meaning that this is another one of the motivations,
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.000]   but rather this is an exhortation.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.400]   This is a therefore conclusion.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.120]   What needs to happen essentially is awake.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.240]   Right?
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.240]   Wake up.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:24.960]   But what I like to say is in this passage, I mean, what a highlight of the gospel truth.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.160]   Like Apostle Paul is challenging us.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:33.080]   Look, you know, you know the difference.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.240]   You've been taught the gospel.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.200]   You know the difference between darkness and light.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.760]   The darkness is subject to wrath.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.760]   The darkness is characterized by blindness.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.080]   The darkness is characterized by vanity and fruitlessness.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.280]   It's absolutely empty.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.040]   But you know the light.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.200]   The light of God produces righteousness.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.440]   The light of God is powerful.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.040]   The light of God illuminates and makes you wise.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.280]   Wake up and see.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.800]   What a challenge.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.840]   This passage actually is a quotation, a rendering of the Old Testament passage in Isaiah chapter
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.920]   60.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:17.280]   And this passage reads like this, "Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.880]   of the Lord has risen upon you.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:24.560]   For behold, darkness will cover the earth and the deep darkness the people, but the
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.560]   Lord will rise upon you and his glory will appear upon you.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.000]   Nations will come to your light and kings to the brightness of your rising.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Lift up your eyes, round about and see.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.280]   They all gather together.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.600]   They come to you.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:43.320]   Your sons will come from afar and your daughters will be carried in the arms.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:49.360]   Then you will see and be radiant and your heart will thrill and rejoice because the
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.800]   abundance of the sea will be turned to you.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.080]   The wealth of the nations will come to you."
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:00.800]   To me, that's a great, great picture of the gospel call.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:08.000]   When we're calling people to the light, yes, by nature of the circumstance, the light is
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.840]   going to expose people's sin.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:18.320]   But we also recognize by being in the light, of course there's shame that like, "Oh my
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.040]   goodness, I was this dirty," right?
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.240]   There's this initial reaction.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.040]   But the picture here is joy.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:31.400]   That by being in the light, when we walk in the light of God, there is this, like all
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:37.560]   the stuff here is thoughts of radiance, glory, abundance, because that's what the Lord provides.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:42.240]   For us, this was such a convicting passage.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:47.000]   In John chapter three, it says, "This is a judgment that the light has come into the
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   world.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.720]   The men love the darkness rather than the light for their deeds were evil.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:57.560]   For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light for fear that
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.360]   his deeds will be exposed.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:04.720]   But he who practices the truth comes to the light so that his deeds may be manifested
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.640]   as having been wrought of God."
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:20.320]   If you noticed, in the previous passage, the section of our verse, excuse me, why did I
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.320]   not have it all of a sudden?
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.800]   Okay, here we go.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:28.000]   When you look at this passage here, in verse 13, it reads a little funny, right?
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.320]   But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.240]   For everything that becomes visible is light.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.120]   It's like, wait, what?
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:40.280]   I get the idea that everything becomes visible when they're exposed to the light because
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.840]   that's what we should be doing.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:49.440]   We're essentially shining the light, the light of Christ, with his truth, with his reality,
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:53.320]   with what he's given to us as this is actually the way things are.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:58.040]   The lies that we've been told where your sins are inconsequential doesn't hurt anybody,
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.040]   right?
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.280]   No one actually is affected by that stuff.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.280]   No, that's not true.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.480]   All those things are a lie, right?
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.800]   If you're going to work hard and you fight for things and all this kind of stuff, you're
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.000]   going to be happy here.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.840]   All that is a lie, right?
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:10.840]   Imagine this.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:15.760]   If you had both all the money in the world, all the liberties, and the power to protect
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.960]   your liberties, and what's more, you had a generation where essentially there was like,
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.520]   I guess you could say, a social utopia, right?
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.600]   To think you would be happy and at peace is an absolute lie.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:35.440]   We learn that without Christ, knowledge without Christ, miracles without Christ, I don't know,
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:39.120]   like an amazing government without Christ, whatever it may be, anything without Christ,
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.040]   money without Christ, possession without Christ, the scripture has already told us, saints
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.080]   before us already told us, King Solomon said, "You know what?
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.240]   Your life doesn't even consist of your possessions."
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:53.840]   You could have all the pleasures in the world, all the reputation, the people's respect,
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.240]   still so empty is what King Solomon said.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:07.040]   Okay, talk about this because when we live by those truths, we're shining light.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.840]   We're shining reality, right?
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:13.960]   And what's really interesting, it says for everything that becomes visible then, it is
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.000]   light.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.220]   So now going back to that John chapter three passage, notice what he says, that as we practice
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:28.600]   the truth and come to the light, our deeds becomes manifest, becomes really, really clear
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.360]   that those deeds are wrought of God.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.300]   And brothers and sisters, that is a powerful thing.
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:40.620]   When we seek to abide by the truth of God, both the light is shining upon us and what's
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:46.480]   more we are shining, that the faith that God has given us is bearing its fruit.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:51.860]   And then us, we're indicating and revealing that the mighty power of God is working within
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:52.860]   us.
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.220]   And so I just want to give this challenge again.
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:02.040]   Today, in this passage, there were many motivations, but essentially when I say motivations, those
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.840]   are propositional faith truths.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.300]   This is who you are.
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.620]   This is what righteousness is.
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:08.620]   This is what light produces.
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.140]   This is what darkness produces.
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:14.920]   Those are all propositional truths of faith.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:20.620]   I pray that you hold onto those things dearly, that they become powerful motivators for you
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:24.420]   to not only resist temptation, but walk in righteousness.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:25.740]   Let's pray.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:29.940]   Lord, we thank you so much for your word, God.
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:30.940]   Truly, Lord.
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:35.380]   God, it would be devastating for us if we're not able to study your word.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.580]   Why?
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:42.380]   Because we would be lost, because we wouldn't be able to see, because we'd be in darkness.
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:48.580]   I pray, Lord, that right now, again, as we are in somewhat of an incredibly strange time
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:56.900]   of unrest, division, anger, injustices, all these things, Lord, I pray, Father God, that
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.860]   we would cling all the more to your truth.
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:04.620]   Grant to us wisdom, understanding, discretion.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:09.540]   Grant to us, Father God, greater faith, that God, we would not operate and react simply
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:14.780]   by what we see, but Lord, we would walk by what you have already told us.
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.340]   We thank you, it's in Christ, and we pray.
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:16.700]   Amen.
