[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 11, I'll be reading from
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.840]   verse 25 through verse 29.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.280]   Romans chapter 11, verse 25 through 29.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.600]   Lest you be wise in your own sight, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.660]   A partial hardening has come upon Israel, unto the fullness of the Gentiles has come
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.660]   in.
[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.640]   And in this way, all Israel will be saved.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.460]   As it is written, the deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.520]   Jacob.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.940]   And this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins.
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.340]   As regards to the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake.
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.080]   But as regards to election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.360]   For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.800]   Let's pray.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.120]   Father, we thank you.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.480]   We thank you for your word.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.680]   We thank you for your Holy Spirit's leadership and guidance.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.600]   We pray, Father God, that you would anoint this time, that bless this place, Lord, with
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.880]   your grace and with your presence.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.960]   I pray that your word would speak to us, it would judge us, convict us, encourage and
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.360]   lift us up, Lord God.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.560]   That as we see a greater vision of Christ and his work, that we would give a reasonable
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.060]   response with our lives.
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.680]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.120]   As you guys know, all over the news this week, probably the number one topic of discussion,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.720]   and it probably will be for a while, is what happened in Vegas.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.640]   And so I know, I've already talked to some people in our church who knew people actually
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.640]   who was there.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.580]   I think I talked to somebody that knew somebody who actually got shot.
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.840]   And so, I mean, it's so close to us that we'll probably have some kind of connection if we
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.840]   looked into it.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.040]   But obviously, it was very shocking what happened.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.240]   It was probably, I think they said it was the largest mass shooting in the country.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.320]   I mean, we've had quite a few of those in the last few years, but the one that happened
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.520]   last week was the biggest.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.720]   And obviously, there's a lot of discussion going on, like why did this happen?
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.520]   And they're looking into his life to try to find clues as to what triggered it.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.600]   Was he mentally not stable?
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.880]   Was it what political party was he a part of?
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.120]   Was there evidence who helped him out?
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.240]   And even in the theological church setting, there's a lot of discussion going on.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.760]   And I feel Lozan's trying to figure out, you know, what part did God play in that?
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.520]   Is God completely, you know, off on the side and the world has lost control?
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.560]   So, you know, how do we understand this, even spiritually?
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.960]   And so, there's a lot of discussion going on.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.160]   More discussions will go on.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.600]   And I remember, again, what happened this last weekend.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.240]   And as horrific as that was, you know, some of you guys may remember 9/11 and when that
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.840]   hit and the kind of discussion that was going on, very similar, but obviously a lot more
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.280]   intense just because of the scale.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.000]   And it really changed the landscape of how we viewed politics and view world affairs.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.540]   And some of you guys may remember what it was like before and after and all the safety
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.640]   and concern and international concerns.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.720]   And I think it was the first time when we were aware that there's a whole group of people
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.000]   who literally just wants to wipe the US out of the, you know, off the map.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.160]   And so, there's been a lot of discussion then.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.880]   And since then, I've had so many discussions with people concerning those type of stuff.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.480]   If God is good, why does He allow evil?
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.480]   That's a typical question.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.600]   So, if you've ever tried to witness to non-Christians, family members, or whoever, that's a topic
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.780]   that often comes up.
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.600]   If your God is as good as you say He is, why does He allow these things to happen?
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.240]   So, we have various theories.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.320]   People give, you know, theologians and pastors and their sermons being given about, you know,
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.640]   what's going on and how, you know, how we ought to understand all of these things.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   But in the end, it is a mystery.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.320]   How far do we understand, like, what is God's plan in this?
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.820]   Is this God's form of judgment?
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.360]   And so, a lot of people are making, you know, statements about all of this.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.200]   But in the end, it is a mystery.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.880]   The one thing that we do know as a fact, for sure, that our God is absolutely sovereign
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.240]   and He is in control.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:23.400]   And sometimes, whether it's natural disasters or in the face of horrendous evil, with wars
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.200]   and rumors of wars and all these things going on, we've seen through the study of the book
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   of Revelation and all throughout Scripture, there aren't pockets of periods when God is
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.000]   in control and then there's pockets of periods when God is engaged.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.320]   We know for a fact that from the very beginning until the very end, that our God is always
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.560]   sitting on His throne.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   So as we've been studying through the book of Revelation, we've been studying all the
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.200]   judgments, the plagues, the trumpet judgments, the seal judgments, and then now we're headed
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.960]   into the bowl judgments.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   And in the context of horrendous things that is prophesied is going to take place, John
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.640]   is given glimpses of the throne of God, and every time he sees a glimpse of this throne,
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.480]   God is not panicking.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.040]   There's no great concern where everybody's running around anxious.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.860]   God is sitting on His throne and the elders and the creatures are circling around this
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.460]   throne praising Him and worshiping Him in the context of chaos that is breaking out
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.020]   on earth.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.660]   And I believe that there's a reason for that, that it's not random, that in the context
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:37.260]   of all of this, all this stuff going on, it is a constant reminder to John and to us that
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.820]   all of these things are in God's sovereign hand, even though we may not fully understand
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.860]   it, that God is still sovereign, that the picture that we have of heaven is never shaken,
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.040]   never anxious, never out of control.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.040]   He's being worshipped.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.820]   Our God is still on His throne.
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.900]   There's a lot of things that happen in life, whether it is in the big picture of human
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.180]   history, what's happening in politics around the world, maybe even in your personal life.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.100]   You may be asking the question, like, "I don't know how these things fit into the larger
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.780]   picture of my salvation.
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.340]   I don't know why God is allowing these things to happen in my life because we're trying
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.620]   to make sense of it, but we can't quite answer what these are."
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.380]   And so there are times when we don't see the larger picture, where we may begin to question,
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.860]   "Is God really there?
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.900]   If He's really there, does He care?"
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.340]   Or maybe God isn't as sovereign as we've been told in the Scripture.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.460]   Maybe He does care, but He just doesn't have the power to do anything about it.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.680]   And so we go through all of these different thoughts, and when we go through sufferings
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.560]   and different things that we experience that we can't understand, it begins to change the
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.620]   way we view God, it begins to change maybe even our theology, if we're not careful.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:01.740]   If you look at Israel's history, not just the period when Paul is writing this letter,
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.020]   remember how Israel started.
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.260]   God made a promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that He was going to multiply them,
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.460]   that they're going to have this vast land, that God's going to bless all the world through
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.820]   them.
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:22.360]   And after He does that, where and when does the actual nation of Israel start?
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.720]   It started when they were slaves in Egypt.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.520]   They were crying out because they were suffering.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.800]   Can you imagine what they were thinking?
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.640]   They were probably told by their ancestors that God made a covenant with us, and because
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.000]   of this covenant that He said He's going to be faithful and that our nation, the Jewish
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.760]   nation is going to be blessed and we're going to multiply, we're going to possess the land.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.840]   And they probably told that from generation to generation to generation.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.480]   But when Israel actually physically started, they were being beaten up for not working
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.480]   hard.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.480]   They were being surprised.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.760]   They weren't eating well, and when they complained, it got even harder.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.760]   And as a result of the suffering, they cried out to God, and God said, "I heard the groanings
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.580]   of my people, and that's why He calls Moses to go deliver my people."
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:16.080]   So this question of, is God done with Israel?
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:22.320]   This is not the first time that Israel probably asked this question.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.580]   That question was probably asked over and over and over again in Israel's history.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.100]   From the very beginning, they probably had that question.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.320]   If God is for us, why would He allow these things to happen?
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:40.280]   As soon as they get delivered, they're praising God, they go into the desert, and they're
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.880]   starving, some of them, they're thirsty.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.280]   Why would God who loves us and delivers us allow this to happen?
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.440]   Is God done with us?
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.460]   By no means.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.240]   But it's not just the beginning, it's not just the middle.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:00.380]   All throughout Israel's history, Israel's history is about the suffering of God's people.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:14.260]   Whether it was Egypt, Philistines, the Assyrians, the Babylonians, Edomites, or the Romans.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:20.420]   And even since then, we can think about all these different stages after the time of Christ.
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.020]   And obviously, the obvious one is the Holocaust.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:29.220]   Israel's history is filled with markers where you can imagine they probably were crying
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.140]   out to God, "God, are you done with us?
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.820]   I know you made a promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but why would you allow these things
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.380]   to happen?"
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.260]   So when Paul is answering this question, "Is God done with Israel?
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.860]   Have they fallen to the point where they can't get up?
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.420]   Have we exhausted His patience?"
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.460]   This is probably not the first time they asked that question.
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.740]   It was actually probably embedded into their culture.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:01.380]   Time and time again, questioning if God is good, if God made this promise, why does this
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:08.060]   happen over and over and over and over and over again?
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:13.660]   The text that we're looking at this morning, where Paul has been warning us and encouraging
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:20.420]   us at the same time, consider the kindness and the severity of God.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:26.500]   Consider the kindness of God that despite their generations of sin, is God done?
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.580]   He says, "No, by no means."
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.980]   But consider the severity, that despite He made this covenant with them, that He kept
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.420]   them accountable for their sins.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.340]   He never swept their sins under the rug.
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.660]   And so he tells the Gentiles, he says, "Consider His severity and His kindness."
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.760]   And today, the text that we're looking at, starting from verse 25, he's given us a larger
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:51.620]   picture of this gospel, that even though you may not fully understand, that this is how
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.320]   the mystery of God has been revealed.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.140]   And so the first thing that he says about understanding what God is doing, he says,
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.700]   "Consider this mystery," verse 25, "lest you be wise in your own conceit, I want you to
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.180]   understand the mystery."
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:11.300]   In other words, what he is saying is that all this time, whether you understood it or
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.660]   not, God has been fulfilling His sovereign plan.
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:20.820]   All of Israel's history, all of human history from Genesis to Revelation, was an unveiling
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.940]   of what God had ordained from the very beginning.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.780]   So whether they were prospering, whether they were suffering, whether they were in the context
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:34.380]   of being judged, or whether they were multiplying and living in peace, that all of it, in the
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.540]   end, was a revelation of His mystery.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:44.180]   And so, again, in Romans chapter 16, 25 to 26, he says, "Not to him who is able to strengthen
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:49.080]   you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.780]   of mystery that was kept secret for long ages."
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:59.460]   Notice how he says, there's mystery, but it was deliberately kept secret, that not all
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.340]   of it was revealed.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:06.460]   There's an aspect of God's redemptive history that God made very plain, that He was going
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:12.260]   to save the world, but the specifics of how He was going to reveal this was kept a secret.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:17.140]   He says it again in Ephesians 3, 9 through 10, "And to bring to light to everyone what
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:22.980]   is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things, so that through
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.380]   the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.380]   in the heavenly places."
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:35.220]   So again, he says, here's this mystery, God's salvation plan, what He has ordained, and
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:41.180]   He made it very clear what He was doing, but how this was going to be accomplished was
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:46.080]   kept a mystery, and it was being revealed to the church and to the apostles, and now
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.940]   we have the clear word of God.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:55.940]   Again in Colossians 1, 26, 27, "The mystery hidden for ages and generations, but now revealed
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.100]   to the saints.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.100]   To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:06.220]   of the mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.900]   Now the point of what Paul is saying here about the mystery is simply to say, "You
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.700]   do not know."
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.020]   You may not understand what God was doing with the nation of Israel, but that's the
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.020]   mystery of God.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:24.880]   Now He's making it known, and they were probably asking the question, "If God loves us, why
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.100]   was He allowing these things to happen?"
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:34.900]   If these are your people, God, if the nation of Israel are the apple of your eye, why are
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.640]   they acting like that toward you?
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.220]   Why is their heart hardened toward you?
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:48.080]   And so Paul is telling them to examine carefully the mystery of God, that first and foremost,
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:54.260]   that it would humble you, that they may not be conceited and wise in their own mind.
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:14:00.260]   Whenever we examine, whether it's history or even our own lives, that we don't get,
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.680]   you know, our first thing, our first natural response is, "How do we make sense of things?"
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:11.300]   So going back to what happened last weekend, there's all kinds of discussion.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.820]   Non-Christians are trying to pinpoint maybe it was his upbringing, maybe it's his political
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.260]   view, you know, maybe it's because we have guns being sold just left and right, maybe
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.780]   that's the problem, you know.
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.100]   Maybe he hated country music.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:29.580]   I mean, there have all kinds of theories have gone out and trying to make sense of things.
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:35.380]   But even within the church, I know that there's a lot of people, even within the church, who
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:40.940]   are confessing Christians are wrestling with, "Why did God allow that to happen?"
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:46.780]   And so people have various theories that maybe God isn't powerful, maybe God doesn't care,
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.020]   you know, or maybe God had nothing to do with it.
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.860]   And he's just as saddened by what happened.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:59.220]   Like, he's just as surprised of the magnitude of the sin.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:04.860]   And so we start to create a God in our own mind that makes sense to us.
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.620]   And then if we're not careful, we begin to form a God that fits into my ideology, my
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.620]   theology.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:17.220]   And see, Paul is presenting to us, Scripture is presenting to us, that the mystery of Christ
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.660]   is above us.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:22.420]   And he says, "One, so therefore do not be conceited because God is sovereign.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.860]   One, do not be conceited to the Israelites, because the same temptation that caused them
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.620]   to fall is the same tension that can cause you to fall.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.220]   So to be careful not to be arrogant toward them, but ultimately do not be arrogant toward
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.220]   God."
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:40.460]   That God knows what He's doing.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:45.780]   Whether you can make sense of it or not, whether the dots can be connected and say, "Oh, I
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.780]   understand."
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.900]   Whether you can make sense of it or not, whether you don't understand or not, our God is sitting
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:53.900]   on His throne and being worshipped, completely sovereign.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:59.700]   In Proverbs 3, 5-7, and I know you know this passage well, it says, "Trust in the Lord
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.620]   with all your heart."
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:06.360]   And I think the part that I want to talk about is all your heart.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:11.080]   If you're a Christian, you wouldn't be a Christian if you haven't trusted Him.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.360]   You wouldn't have repented if you didn't trust in Him.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.100]   But this passage doesn't say trust in the Lord.
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:21.740]   It says, "Trust in the Lord with all of your heart and do not lean on your own understanding."
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:27.300]   Not only when God makes sense, but a lot of times when He doesn't make sense.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.540]   Not only when things are the way that you think it ought to be, but especially in places
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.740]   when you try to look at things and things don't make sense.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.220]   Trust in the Lord with all of your heart.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:47.060]   You know, our natural tendency is we trust in the Lord in things that we think at.
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:53.180]   So if you're not good with money and you have a hard time paying your bills and you're
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.540]   struggling to find a job or whatever it may be, we cling to these verses, "Trust in
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.420]   the Lord with all your heart, lean not on your own understanding."
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.540]   Because we're not good at it, we're helpless.
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.280]   But in the areas that we think we're good at, maybe some of you guys are type A personalities
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.740]   and you have your whole life planned out and next year you're going to do this, next year
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.220]   you're going to do that, and so far it's been going well.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.260]   You're moving up in ranks at your work and you're making decent money, you're paying
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.020]   your bills, so you're good with your money.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:23.500]   And so in those areas we have a hard time trusting in God, you know.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.540]   But maybe some of you guys are not good with your classes, maybe you're failing in your
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.380]   class and you've tried everything and then you trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.380]   Lean not on your own understanding.
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.300]   I've done everything I could and it's just not working, so I've got to trust the Lord,
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.660]   right?
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.660]   That's our tendency.
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.860]   Our tendency is on the things that we think we don't have control over, we have to trust
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:44.860]   Him.
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.060]   But on the things that we think we have some control over, we have a hard time letting
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.380]   go.
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:54.980]   So when He says, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not on your own understanding,
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.340]   in all your ways acknowledge Him."
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.720]   In all your ways.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.060]   Things that make sense and things that don't make sense, all your ways acknowledge Him
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.000]   and He will make your path straight.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.180]   Sometimes what we think is good in the larger picture turns out to be really bad.
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.220]   If you live long enough you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.100]   Then there are some things that you thought at that moment that it was going to ruin your
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:26.180]   life and then you look back at it and say, "Wow, you could completely see God's sovereignty."
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.780]   Everybody believes in predestination historically.
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.780]   They just have a hard time swallowing it now and looking forward.
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:39.220]   I've never heard somebody give a testimony and they say, "You know, I did it all.
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:43.140]   I made the plan and I chose the right people and I met these right people and I chose to
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.580]   open my ears and hear God."
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.740]   I've never heard, whether you are a Presbyterian or Baptist or whatever, everybody believes
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.740]   in God's sovereignty because whenever they give testimony, they say, "Wow, you know,
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.780]   God brought that person into my life and somehow I ran into this person and I don't know,
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.580]   I wasn't even seeking Him and I heard the gospel and it just made sense to me all of
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.580]   a sudden."
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.820]   All of a sudden, everything seems to cook together when we look at our past.
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.260]   We just have a hard time understanding how it works together today and tomorrow.
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:17.700]   See, Paul is saying to the Gentiles, he said, "You may not understand fully what God is
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.700]   doing.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.060]   There's parts of it where God left it a mystery, but when you look back at Israel's history
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:28.180]   and all the suffering and all the difficulty, even in the midst of all the judgment, if
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:34.060]   there's any period of time in Israel's history where they were completely without hope, it
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.180]   would have been the time when this was being written."
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.860]   And I know people may say, "Well, what about the Holocaust?"
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.140]   Think about the situation where Paul was writing this letter.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.860]   These Jews were waiting for the Messiah through all of their suffering.
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.100]   Their answer was the Messiah.
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.380]   Once the Messiah comes, He's going to make us a superpower.
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.380]   We're going to be wealthy.
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.780]   Our children are going to be well-fed.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.220]   Our religion is going to be the greatest religion.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:07.500]   And so everything that they were suffering for, every answer that they had was the Messiah.
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:15.500]   And yet when the Messiah, the Son of God comes, they end up rejecting Him and crucifying Him.
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:21.140]   So if there was any period in Israel's history where they could have said, "Is God done with
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.140]   Israel?"
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.140]   It would have been now.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:28.740]   If there's any time, if there's any time there was any doubt that God would have lost patience
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:34.300]   with His people and would have said, "Enough," it would have been the time when this book
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.140]   was being written in the first century.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:42.740]   I mean, He put up with their rebellion while they were in the desert, with the griping
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:48.060]   and complaining, and even going into captivity questioning God, even after God gives them
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.820]   a chance to return, a very few of them even return.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.280]   And over and over again, through all of that, God's been patient.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:21:00.200]   But there's any time, like any one of us would understand if God cut them off and moved on,
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.220]   it would have been at the writing of this letter.
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:10.120]   And yet even then, He says, "I am not done with Israel."
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:15.020]   In fact, not only is He not done, He said, "This is part of the mystery that's being
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:21.180]   revealed, how He's using their hardening of the heart and rejection and rebellion to ultimately
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:25.360]   He's going to bring salvation to mankind."
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.980]   This mystery is revealed in three separate ways.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.380]   Again, three separate in progress.
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:36.760]   One, He says, that they experienced a partial hardening of their heart.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.300]   At this time of this letter being written, Israel was for the most part rejecting their
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.300]   Messiah.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.500]   There are some who converted, obviously like Apostle Paul, but for the most part, they've
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.500]   hardened their heart.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.940]   And I think it's interesting that the way that their rejection of their Messiah and
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:56.820]   the gospel, and they simply call it hardening.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.100]   When something is hardened, it means they're not molded.
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.700]   They're not able to be molded.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:06.940]   So we are the clay, He is the powder, means when they are hardened, they're resisting
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:07.940]   God.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.700]   You don't have to shake your fist at God and say, "I don't want you to be in a rebellion
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.700]   against God."
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.660]   All you have to do is resist Him.
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:22.460]   And that's why often Israel's sin is described as being stiff-necked.
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.000]   As being stiff-necked.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.340]   God says all of these things, and you say, "Well, I don't know."
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:32.820]   Not completely trusting in Him and seeking life outside of God.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.820]   They were stiff-necked.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:43.260]   So the first stage of this unfolding, at least from this point on, is that they've experienced
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.060]   a partial stiffening, a hardening.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:51.460]   But the second stage is that Israel's hardening is temporary.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.980]   That because of their hardening, the gospel was opened up to the Gentile world.
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:01.020]   His primary function, even remember when Jesus came, the Gentiles would come and say, "Hey,
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.020]   would you heal me?"
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.840]   And Jesus would say, "I did not come to the Gentiles.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.900]   I came to the house of Israel, the house of Judah."
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:13.100]   In other words, up to the point of Christ's crucifixion, His primary concern was to work
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.420]   through the nation of Israel.
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:20.420]   But part of the mystery, part of the gospel mystery that was being revealed is, now the
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:25.140]   time, because they've hardened, and because they've rejected Him, now the gospel is going
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.900]   out to the Gentile world.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.660]   That was the second stage.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:34.820]   That God is using even their sins to take the gospel to the remotest part of the world.
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.700]   In other words, He said, "God has not lost control."
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:42.860]   He wasn't doing plan A, and because they rejected the Messiah, He said, "Well, let's go to plan
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.860]   B."
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.660]   It wasn't plan B. He said, "From the very beginning, this was ordained by God.
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.820]   God is still on His throne, and He knows exactly what He is doing."
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.800]   But this period is temporary.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:00.100]   Second Peter 3.9, He said, "The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise, as some count
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:05.620]   slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.860]   reach repentance."
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:14.420]   The whole reason why you and I are here is because God ordained this period for us.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:19.020]   He ordained this period so that you and I can come to Christ.
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:23.260]   And if He doesn't come in our generation, it's because He's being patient toward our
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.820]   children.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:29.100]   And if He doesn't come in that generation, the whole reason is so that He can be patient
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:35.180]   with our grandchildren, so that no one, no one's name who's written in the book of life
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.220]   will be left out.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:42.760]   So in other words, He says, in God's mystery that is being revealed, that they experience
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:48.540]   a temporary hardening of the heart, in order that the gospel may go out to the Gentiles,
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:55.620]   which you and I, this period of the church, but it also means that it's temporary, that
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.980]   God has designed a time when this time will end.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.900]   That this is God ordained.
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:08.940]   It's time for us to take the baton and to take the gospel to the remotest part of the
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.620]   world, because that's His ordained time.
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:16.220]   You and I are living in a period when God said, "I have allowed them to be hardened
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.400]   in order that you may come to Christ."
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.380]   Why He didn't come in the first century, second century, third century, was so that you and
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.660]   I can also enter the kingdom of God.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:33.500]   If that is God's purpose and His mystery, like where do we fit into this?
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.400]   Pretty obvious.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:42.620]   Every single one of us ought to understand the urgency to spread the gospel.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:49.280]   Because the whole reason why Israel was hardened was to give us an opportunity.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.500]   In Revelation 20, 15 it says, "And if anyone's name was not found in the written book of
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.860]   life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.260]   That there are names written in the book of life that God has ordained, and until the
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:12.940]   full number comes in, He says, "God is going to allow them to be hardened."
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:18.340]   There should be a sense of urgency in every Christian to spread the gospel.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.800]   Thirdly, He said the first stage is hardening, second stage is opening.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.380]   One door shuts and another door opens.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:30.300]   But thirdly, God's ultimate plan is to restore Israel.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.860]   In this way, He says, all Israel will be saved.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:39.340]   I think one of the questions that I ask is, does all Israel mean that every single Jew,
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.180]   whether they believe Jesus Christ or not, are they going to be saved?
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:47.340]   I've actually heard a radio program where they were mocking dispensationalism and say,
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:52.140]   "Do you dispensationalists believe that you can go to heaven even if you don't believe
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.260]   in Jesus Christ because they think all Israel is going to be saved?"
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:27:00.820]   That is a very misunderstanding or false accusation toward dispensationalism.
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:05.060]   If you don't know what dispensationalism is, don't worry about it.
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.060]   That is not what they're saying.
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:12.100]   It said that the elect of God, they're going to experience a great revival once that period
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:17.940]   of God's patience for the Gentiles is done and we are at the end times, God's going to
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:23.460]   bring revival again for His people and there's going to be a mass revival and conversion
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:29.180]   among the Israelites and all those that have been ordained to eternal life in Israel, He
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:32.860]   said, is going to be saved.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.500]   Now what is the point of all of this?
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.500]   One, He made it very clear so that we may not be considered and wise in our own sight,
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.460]   right, and wise in our own understanding.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.900]   That we don't look at it and try to make sense of things and contradict what God has said.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:48.900]   Maybe God is not strong.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:53.940]   Maybe God is not faithful and start to question and start having doubts about our faith.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:28:00.860]   The whole purpose of it is to tell us that what you do understand, what you don't understand.
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:05.380]   That God is completely sovereign sitting on His throne.
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:11.260]   I think Romans chapter 9, 4 through 6 kind of summarizes the whole point that He's been
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.260]   trying to make.
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:16.980]   He says, "They are Israelites and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants,
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.380]   the giving of the law, the worship, the promise.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.580]   To them belong the patriarchs and from their race according to the flesh is the Christ
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.080]   who is God overall, blessed forever, amen.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:33.020]   But it is not as though the word of God has failed."
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:38.420]   What He has promised, He will fulfill.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:43.220]   Isn't that the struggle that you and I have on a day-to-day basis?
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.020]   We know what the word of God says.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.940]   You've been at the church long enough.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.220]   You've been a Christian long enough to know what the word of God says.
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.800]   "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, all these things shall be added unto you."
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.720]   You memorize it.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.580]   Maybe some of you have it tattooed somewhere.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.580]   I don't know.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:28:59.780]   Maybe it's hanging on the wall somewhere.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.480]   We know it.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.740]   But the struggle is do you believe it?
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.180]   Do you believe it?
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:11.580]   And if you believe it, how does that change your decision-making?
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.580]   How does that change the way you spend your money?
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:18.220]   How does that change the way you view people?
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:22.200]   How does that change the way you invest your time?
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.860]   We know what it says.
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.780]   Where the rubber meets the road is do you believe it?
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:36.960]   See this unveiling and revealing of the mystery of the gospel is to show even in Israel's
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.740]   hardening, God is absolutely in control.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.000]   He's allowed it to be opened.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   He shut one door so the other door can be opened.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.860]   But at the end of it all, the sovereign God is completely in control and the word of God
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.640]   will not fail.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.840]   In summary, in verse 28, it says, "As regards to the gospel, they are enemies of God for
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:02.400]   your sake, but as regards to the election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers."
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.160]   Now there's so much wisdom and truth contained just in that verse.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:11.560]   As regards to the gospel, they become enemies of God.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.320]   Consider the severity of God.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.880]   Consider that even God's people, even the people that He made a promise to, Abraham,
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:24.480]   Isaac, and Jacob, His very people that He called apple of His eyes, even them, when
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:29.800]   they rebelled against God, they were punished.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:36.760]   Do not ever be deceived to think that God is ever okay with sin.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.880]   The same God who punished sin in the Old Testament is the same God of the New Testament.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.940]   He will always be holy, holy, holy.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:53.400]   Do not ever be deceived by a false prophet from the past, present, or the future to think
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:31:01.160]   that somehow God's tolerance towards sin is better today than He was in the past.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:08.320]   He's shown us through how He has dealt with His people.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.140]   Consider His severity.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:15.520]   God will never be okay with sin.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.120]   But also consider His kindness, the second part.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.760]   But as regards to election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:28.640]   But the second part of the warning is, do not ever consider, do not ever be deceived
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:37.560]   by Satan himself to think that somehow your sin is beyond his mercy.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:43.760]   As the false prophets went out to give lies and saying, "Well, God doesn't care what
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.880]   you do," because that was the primary message of the false prophets.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.080]   God is not angry with you.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.080]   There is no hell.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.640]   There is no judgment.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.640]   God just wants you to be encouraged.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.720]   God wants what's best for you.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.640]   He was grandfather just giving out candy whenever He wants.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.520]   I mean, that's the false prophets.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:06.080]   And then the accuser of the brother, Satan himself, he'd harp on every mistake you make,
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.840]   every past sin.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.840]   And we'll keep you down.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.520]   Make sure when you fall and you give him an opportunity, he's going to come and he's going
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.160]   to make sure that he keeps you down.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.800]   God can't love you.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.520]   Maybe the first few times, but you've been wrestling with that sin for so many years.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.640]   God can't possibly.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.360]   You've exhausted his patience.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:36.120]   So don't ever be deceived to think that somehow our sins will exhaust his patience.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:43.800]   As long as we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us all our unrighteousness.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:50.700]   So consider the severity of God and also consider the kindness of God.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.360]   And these two things go hand in hand.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.720]   You mistake one or the other, you've ruined the gospel.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.320]   That's not the gospel at all.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.960]   You've taken grace out.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.960]   That's not the gospel.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.240]   You've taken holiness out.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.360]   That's not the gospel.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.640]   The mystery of the cross reveals all of it.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:17.360]   That the holy, holy, holy God, despite all our sin, if we repent of our sins, He's faithful
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.360]   and just to forgive us all our unrighteousness.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:29.020]   As basic, as fundamental as that is, you're going to spend all your life wrestling with
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.560]   the application of these truths.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.560]   The application of his kindness and the application of his severity.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:39.920]   There are times when you need to be reminded of his severity because maybe you're just
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.080]   too light about sin.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.000]   Maybe you're struggling with purity and it's just, well, everybody struggles with it.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.240]   At what point do we draw the line?
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.320]   And you just kind of allowed sin into your life and compromise to the extent it no longer
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.560]   bothers your conscience.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.880]   And you need to understand the severity of God.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.840]   There never a time in our life or in history where God is all of a sudden changing and
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.160]   say, he's going to be okay with sin.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:09.840]   He will, he will by no means let sin be sin and just sweep it under the rug.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.960]   But there are so many times also in our lives where you need to understand the kindness
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:14.960]   of God.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:21.960]   He examined the nation of Israel, despite all their failings, despite all that they
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:27.840]   have done, says, I am not done with them.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.560]   Doesn't that give you the assurance?
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:34.320]   Doesn't that give you the confidence to walk and be faithful?
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:39.560]   Doesn't that give you the strength to follow him?
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:45.120]   In Psalm, sorry, in Romans chapter 11, 29, in summary of all of this, he says, for the
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:50.820]   gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:55.880]   If you haven't memorized that passage, I encourage you to memorize that.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.880]   Memorize that.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:03.760]   For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.560]   God is not man that he should lie nor the son of man that he should repent.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.360]   Has he not said and will he not do it?
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.640]   If God said it, he will do it.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:19.320]   Our whole Christian life, our worship, our hope, our friendship, our marriage, all is
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:24.340]   founded upon belief and application of this truth.
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:28.240]   His gift and his calling of God are irrevocable.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.040]   They do not change.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.480]   And we run to that.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.760]   We run to it when we sin.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.920]   We run to it when we doubt.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.360]   We run to it when we need courage.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.360]   We run to it when we need hope, when we're in despair, when we need a refuge.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.520]   This is what we run to, his promises.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.320]   Psalm 105, 7-10.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.020]   He is the Lord our God.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.460]   His judgments are in all the earth.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:59.880]   He remembers his covenant forever, the word that he commanded for a thousand generations,
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:04.920]   the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac, which he confirmed
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:11.200]   to Jacob as a statute to Israel as an everlasting covenant.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.200]   Would you take a minute?
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:17.360]   Again, I'm going to ask the praise team to come up.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.960]   I think the challenge for us, you know, and I can't speak for every church and I can't
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:27.200]   speak for generation as a whole, even though I do think it does apply.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:35.120]   The challenge for us is not knowing what it says, but believing what you already know.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.280]   Believing what you already know.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.800]   Not superficial, knee-jerk reactions like, "Oh yeah, of course I believe.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.560]   And of course I believe Jesus died for me on the cross."
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.060]   But do you believe it?
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.000]   Do you believe the covenant that he made?
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Do you believe the promises?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.200]   Do you also believe in the warning?
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.800]   Do you also believe when he says, "Broad is the way that leads to destruction."
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.920]   And many will be found on it, but narrow is the path that leads to eternal life.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.720]   And very few will be found on it.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.040]   Do you also believe that?
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.400]   Do you also apply that in your life?
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:13.840]   As we come before the Lord and we consider God's patience and severity with his people,
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.200]   and how all through all of this, our God is completely sovereign, that his word has not
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:23.040]   failed us, that his gift and his calling are irrevocable, that as we take some time to
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:28.360]   consider all of these things, again, not to simply superficially say, "I believe it,"
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:35.200]   but to examine and honestly pray before God, "I believe, help my unbelief," so that
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.560]   our faith will be real.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.880]   Let's take some time to pray before God as our worship team leads us.
