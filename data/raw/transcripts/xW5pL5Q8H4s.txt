[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.740]   We're gonna go ahead and get started with Bible study.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.820]   So why don't we just take a couple of minutes
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.060]   to just quiet our hearts before we get
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.260]   into a time of praise.

[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.860]   (audience chattering)
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.180]   Father, we thank you for allowing us to gather tonight.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.580]   We come before you as sinners
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.500]   who are unworthy of your love.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.700]   And we're so thankful for the grace that you've shown us
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.060]   through the death and resurrection of your son, Jesus Christ.
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.100]   We pray that we're reminded of how undeserving we are,
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.820]   that you would humble our hearts,
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.900]   and that we also just recognize
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.820]   who are coming before in prayer,
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:23.260]   that our view of you would be one out of reverence,
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.380]   seeing how almighty you are compared to how small we are,
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.860]   that would that cause us to give you praise and worship
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.340]   in every aspect of our lives.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.020]   And as we come before you in praise,
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.360]   that you'd be honored through the songs that we sing.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.900]   So we love you and pray all this in your name, amen.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.100]   Why don't we all stand for a time of praise?

[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.700]   Can you just join with me in prayer?
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.320]   Father, we approach your throne
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:28.740]   not with foolish confidence,
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.740]   but because of the work of Christ
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.520]   and only because his blood has covered our sins
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.520]   if we profess allegiance and faith to him.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.520]   The Lord, though we are dead to sin, we're still dying.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:54.600]   And before we approach your throne, we wanna confess,
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:04.520]   Father, that we really aren't worthy
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.640]   to really study your word and ask for your blessing
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.960]   outside of your grace.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:16.240]   And Lord, it is our confession that some of us
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:21.680]   in the name of your grace have been reckless with this study,
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.960]   just haphazardly preparing so that our small group members
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.080]   would be appeased.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:34.120]   Lord, I'm sure there are some in here
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.900]   who are very attached to their sins.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.220]   And yet will still come
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.660]   and treat this as an academic exercise.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.820]   Lord, tonight,
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:56.800]   help us not to be combative or arrogant
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.300]   in any way, shape, or form,
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.200]   but that every single one of us would come here broken,
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.000]   longing to draw near to you,
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.360]   and that we would all leave here more humbled.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:15.900]   And with a challenging text like this,
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.660]   Father, we know that we are to worship through it,
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.620]   and yet with all the different things
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.460]   that we're gonna discuss tonight,
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:29.060]   it's hard to give it our hearts.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.380]   It's difficult to draw near to you
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.620]   in worship through this passage
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.300]   when we get lost in all the details.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.060]   So I pray for your grace.
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.620]   And it's your kindness that leads us to repentance.
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.720]   So I pray that you would be oh so kind.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.200]   Lord, you wiped away all the sinners
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.580]   on this earth with a flood,
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.820]   and you were just in doing so.
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.320]   And we are living in a time of grace.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:04.300]   So I pray that this teaching would cause us to have wisdom,
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.380]   to number our days, that we might grow in that wisdom.
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:16.620]   Lord, I pray that you would really protect
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.920]   and just guide our discussion and our time tonight.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:27.200]   And would this exercise only cause us to seek you more.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:33.060]   Father, you've said that we will seek you and find you
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.540]   if we seek you with all of our hearts,
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.840]   no matter what the circumstance that we're in.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.360]   So even in this exercise,
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:46.060]   I pray that a search to know Christ more intimately
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:51.180]   would be in every single one of us.
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.420]   And we pray for your protection and grace.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.580]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:59.380]   We're gonna do something a little differently tonight.
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.060]   You guys know we usually have a time of discussion
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.940]   and then a 20, 25 minute time of teaching,
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.860]   but we're gonna do the teaching portion first
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.220]   to make sure we hedge in some of the discussions
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.340]   that we're gonna have.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:18.580]   This is actually one of the most challenging texts
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.300]   in all the New Testament to interpret.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.280]   And so we're gonna dive in.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.820]   Okay, we're not gonna shy away.
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:29.560]   But let me read the passage to you first.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.540]   And I'm including up to chapter four, verse two,
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.700]   for additional context.
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.540]   All right?
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:44.200]   It reads, "For it is better, if God should will it so,
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.280]   "that you suffer for doing what is right
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.260]   "rather than for doing what is wrong.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.220]   "For Christ also died for sins once for all,
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.960]   "the just for the unjust,
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.360]   "so that he might bring us to God,
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.720]   "having been put to death in the flesh,
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.040]   "but made alive in the spirit.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.520]   "In which also he went and made proclamation
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.000]   "to the spirits now in prison,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.980]   "who once were disobedient,
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.400]   "when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah,
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.840]   "during the construction of the ark,
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.360]   "in which a few, that is, eight persons,
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.540]   "were brought safely through the water.
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:25.460]   "Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you,
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.180]   "not the removal of dirt from the flesh,
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.180]   "but an appeal to God for a good conscience
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.040]   "through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.280]   "who is at the right hand of God,
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.020]   "having gone into heaven after angels and authorities
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.840]   "and powers have been subjected to him.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:44.240]   "Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh,
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.680]   "arm yourselves also with the same purpose,
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.620]   "because he who has suffered in the flesh
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.460]   "has ceased from sin,
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.880]   "so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh,
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.580]   "no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God."
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.060]   This is a very meaty text,
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:08.140]   and I wanna basically lead with
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:12.700]   a couple just heroes in the faith
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.260]   and what they said about this passage, okay?
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.340]   Martin Luther, the reformer,
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.400]   he wrote, "A wonderful text is this,
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.760]   "and a more obscure passage, perhaps,
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.600]   "than any other in the New Testament,
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.920]   "so that I do not know for a certainty
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.600]   "just what Peter means."
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.840]   And this was a man who prayed,
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.560]   who spent a lot of his time pouring into scripture.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.700]   And the late R.C. Sproul, who passed away a few years back,
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.120]   and one of the smartest men to ever have walked the planet,
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.200]   in my opinion, this is what he says.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.200]   "This is a text about which I am open
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.800]   "to correction and reproof,
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.660]   "and I will be quick to ask the apostle,
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.100]   "when I see him in glory, what he meant,"
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.900]   by these very enigmatic words.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.020]   No doubt he's already asked him.
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.240]   He had passed away a few years back.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:16.840]   Now, I'm gonna read one more.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.520]   "There's a lot of views on this passage."
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.320]   And this is what John MacArthur said last month
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.600]   at the Shepherds Conference.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.080]   Okay, he says this.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.600]   "There is no virtue in having many views.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.720]   "The more views means that more people are wrong."
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:40.200]   Now, this is not an easy passage,
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.980]   and the way we're gonna tackle it
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.760]   is we're gonna try to look at it,
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.440]   and then try to land on a conclusion,
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.480]   not start with a conclusion,
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.760]   and then just piece arguments in together.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.940]   Arrogant people do that.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.360]   They'll say, "I am a this person,"
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.400]   without having studied the scriptures.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.680]   "Oh, I ascribe to that,"
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.560]   without actually having looked at the scriptures.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.200]   They usually read one book, or like a book,
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.320]   read a couple articles, and go, "I'm there, I side with that,"
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.960]   because that person was just articulate.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.480]   But these men's words are not living and active.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.160]   They're not sharper than any two-edged sword.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.840]   It's God's word, right?
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.720]   So what we need to do is humbly ask God
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.280]   to bring the scriptures alive to us,
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.760]   searching for a definitive conclusion for this,
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.200]   and yet have a humble posture, okay?
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.000]   Not come up with a view, and then boom.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.360]   Oh, like, "I have a view,
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.920]   "and this is why my view is correct,
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.920]   "and these are the verses that are gonna back that up."
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.360]   Okay, that's ad absolute arrogance.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:51.360]   So there have traditionally been like four-ish views
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.680]   to this passage, but I'm not gonna talk about those at all,
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.840]   all right, because that's not gonna be helpful,
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.120]   because human nature, you're gonna wanna lean toward one,
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.320]   and you're gonna tend to isagy.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.640]   You guys following this?
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.340]   So I'm gonna walk you through the passage,
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:13.340]   and try to humbly tell you my thoughts
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.940]   on certain questions, so that you guys
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.180]   aren't really like going all over the place, okay?
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.020]   So I'm gonna be sharing a lot
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.100]   about what I think it can't mean, all right?
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.060]   But before we do this, whenever we come
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.120]   to a difficult passage in the scriptures,
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.060]   and there's a few really difficult ones
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.700]   throughout history where scholars have debated,
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.060]   and argued, and have come to no conclusion.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.860]   So when we come to a difficult passage,
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.260]   here are some things that we should not do, all right?
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.980]   These are thoughts that we should not have.
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.620]   The first one is, texts like these,
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.820]   because they do not affect major doctrines, are unimportant.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.460]   Especially you guys who aren't into books,
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.380]   or who aren't into discussing theology,
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.860]   who are more like, "Tell me what to do,
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.100]   "and let me shine the light of Christ."
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.540]   Great, your zeal is godly and awesome,
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.200]   but you need to know everything
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.060]   that the Lord has to say, right?
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.060]   So Deuteronomy 4, Proverbs 30 says,
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.340]   "Do not add to his words, or take away from them."
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.740]   He's gonna prove you a liar.
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.900]   Matthew 5, 18, Jesus says, "I did not come to abolish the law.
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.060]   "Heaven and earth will pass away,
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.660]   "but my words will not pass away."
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.100]   Until, like, it's all fulfilled, not one jot or tittle,
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.560]   which are the smallest characters in the Hebrew language,
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.180]   none of them are gonna be gone.
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:37.140]   Everything in the scriptures is there for a purpose, right?
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.100]   And all scripture is God-breathed,
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.620]   and useful for teaching, correcting, rebuking,
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.460]   and training in righteousness,
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.020]   so that you and I may be equipped for every good work,
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.300]   including this.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.460]   You guys follow?
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.780]   So you can't treat a difficult passage and be like,
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.220]   "Eh, I don't need to study this, this is not important,"
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.420]   and just gloss over it.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.020]   So that's one thing we can't do.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:59.600]   Also, you have a defeatist attitude,
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.420]   there is no one way to interpret this text,
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.500]   is also folly.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.540]   There is a conclusion.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.400]   It's God's conclusion.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.080]   You guys agree with that?
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.680]   What God meant is the right way.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.860]   Okay, now for us, it's a little bit
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.580]   of a challenge to discern that,
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:25.580]   but the Holy Spirit has inspired all the scriptures.
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:30.620]   Second Peter 3.16 say the unregenerate and the wicked,
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.260]   they're the ones who distort the scriptures,
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.660]   to make it kind of fit their meaning.
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.860]   So we need to ask God for wisdom,
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.260]   and he will gladly give it,
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.160]   and he will lead us into truth.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.340]   So we're not supposed to think that,
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.880]   oh, there are many opinions on this,
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.900]   and they're all valid, incorrect.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:53.740]   You might not be correct,
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.380]   but that should not be because of laziness,
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:00.300]   or lack of diligence in terms of getting into the scriptures.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.520]   The third thing is, okay, there is one way,
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.140]   but it's beyond me, because I'm not seminary trained.
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.940]   I don't know the Bible.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.100]   I need a seminary degree to properly interpret this text.
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.740]   No, you do not.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:17.260]   Okay, Luke 24, 45,
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.940]   the disciples were with Jesus for three years,
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.260]   and they still didn't get it,
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.940]   until after his resurrection,
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.340]   Jesus opened their minds to understand the scriptures.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.380]   Okay, and these were unlearned, untrained men.
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.620]   John 16, 13, the spirit himself
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.620]   will guide you into all truth.
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.780]   And there's a thing called the doctrine of perspicuity,
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.000]   which basically says the Bible is meant to be read.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.660]   It's a plain book,
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.720]   and any normal person can understand its meaning
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.720]   through illumination of the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.340]   Okay, so if you are a child of God,
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.980]   you can understand this.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.340]   You guys follow?
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.020]   Okay, don't have an insecurity or inferiority complex,
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.700]   'cause inferiority complex and insecurity
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.180]   is just wounded pride.
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.780]   So you need to pursue.
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:06.600]   Now, the latter two are more like just ingest,
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.060]   but things that you guys should pay attention to also.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.340]   If someone disagrees with my interpretation of this text,
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.700]   he is an ignoramus and is influenced by Satan himself
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.980]   to cause division in the church.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:21.020]   Some people actually, they talk like this.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.660]   How could you think that, right?
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.940]   Knowledge puffs up, but what does love do?
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.440]   It always edifies, it always builds up.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.060]   So if someone disagrees with you,
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:35.180]   be okay with that and pursue knowledge together,
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.660]   'cause there is one faith, one Lord, one baptism, right?
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.800]   One God and Father of all.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.300]   And Ephesians 4 says we need to make every effort
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.580]   to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.820]   A lot of that takes work.
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.460]   If you guys are married,
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.500]   would you guys say marriage is easy or it's work?
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.740]   You guys probably say it's a lot of work,
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.460]   'cause you're getting two sinners
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:00.620]   to try to get them like-minded and try to get them to be one.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.140]   It's actually not an easy thing.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.140]   So same thing.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.740]   We can have differing opinions on a passage, on a text,
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:12.120]   but we all need to pursue the right answer, okay?
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.740]   Last one, I should get lost in the details
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.660]   and the minutiae of the text and thereby veer off
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.200]   from the main point and context altogether.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.240]   After all, rabbit trails are super fun.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.780]   Some people love this.
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.220]   They like to pursue conspiracy theories.
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:28.700]   They love to pursue random factoids in the scriptures.
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.500]   Like sometimes it means what it means.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.580]   You don't need to try to find
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.860]   a symbolic meaning of the thing, all right?
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:37.800]   So when we come to a hard passage like today's,
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.100]   your attitude should be none of these.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:44.660]   It really should be a zeal for what is good,
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.540]   which includes pursuing knowledge of the truth
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:52.180]   for excellence in handling of the scriptures,
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.860]   and yet with humility before the Lord
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.060]   and before one another.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.260]   You guys follow?
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.520]   Now, this is one of the most challenging texts
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.720]   in all the scriptures.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.260]   So bigger picture.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:09.980]   I wanted to organize it visually
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.160]   so that we're not sidetracked.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:18.520]   So I look at this as kind of almost a baptism illustration.
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.300]   So the first, verse 17 and what is prior to that
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:28.100]   is describing, in my words, more of a unity to Christ,
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:33.100]   united to Christ in his death by suffering, okay?
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.500]   And then what follows is united to Christ
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.860]   in his resurrection also by the will of God.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:42.700]   And you'll see why I did that.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.380]   So united to Christ in his death,
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.800]   united to Christ in his resurrection,
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.400]   and if you've been at one of our baptisms,
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.500]   that's what we say, right?
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.700]   Do you believe that when you go into the water,
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.780]   you're being united to Christ in his death,
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:54.760]   and when you're coming out of the water,
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.640]   united to Christ in his resurrection?
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.500]   I do, ploosh, right?
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.500]   So that's how we usually do baptism.
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.220]   So the blue is that.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:07.100]   The red bolded words are just significant,
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.000]   grammatical and theological words
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.880]   that I would wanna keep track of,
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.740]   especially like corresponding to that.
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.580]   That drives me nuts.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.620]   I'm like, I don't know what that is.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.720]   So I was trying to figure out what that exactly is.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.120]   Not conclusive yet, okay?
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.100]   But these red words are very important,
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.980]   and then the chapter four, verse one,
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.740]   which isn't part of our study today,
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.340]   but therefores are very important.
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.180]   Why?
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.080]   Because you always wanna ask,
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.580]   what's the therefore therefore?
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.940]   Okay, there's an application that's sought, all right?
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.740]   So those are the important words.
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.180]   The purple bold, what I saw,
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.020]   was there's a lot of suffering in death talk.
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.080]   Some of your translations will actually say death.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.220]   Most of them will say suffer, okay?
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:58.140]   Scholars believe suffer is the more accurate one.
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:02.260]   So there's a lot of suffer, die for sin,
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.260]   death in the flesh, removal of dirt from the flesh,
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.940]   suffer in the flesh, suffered in the flesh,
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.340]   rest of the time in the flesh,
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.220]   living for the will of God.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:14.700]   So there's all of this flesh needs to die motif, okay?
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.500]   The blue highlights are result,
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.540]   I couldn't figure out a different word,
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.580]   so I just put results of the resurrection.
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.160]   So Christ's death and resurrection,
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.860]   what did that do for his people?
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:30.960]   One, it brought us to God.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.080]   Second, there was a proclamation that was made,
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.000]   and we're gonna be looking at that.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.980]   The also he went, that went is not a verb,
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.220]   if you actually look at the original language, okay?
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.740]   But the made proclamation is a verb.
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.140]   So that also happened, and we've also been saved
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.700]   because of the resurrection of Christ from the dead.
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:54.120]   So that's kind of what I'm receiving through this.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:58.420]   And the green, it talks about the will of God.
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.500]   1 Peter is one of the most will of God
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.460]   centered books in the New Testament.
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.880]   And from the very beginning, chapter one, verse six,
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.720]   what does he say?
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.740]   In this you greatly rejoice,
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:16.440]   even though for a while, if necessary,
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.000]   you have been grieved by various trials, right?
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.300]   So these are all according to the will of God.
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:28.280]   God will ordain suffering in your life for his glory.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.180]   True or false?
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:33.120]   That's not out of his control.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:39.020]   God will ordain hardship in our lives
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.400]   to discipline and train us, true or false?
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.760]   Yeah, okay?
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.560]   So that is very important in 1 Peter,
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.720]   and I see this in terms of God's will is perfect.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.560]   He makes no mistakes.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.800]   He is sovereign overall.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.080]   And that middle entire section is a proof of that.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.360]   Okay, authorities, angels, power is all subjected to him.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.200]   All right?
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.080]   Yellow highlight is the one command in this whole section.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.720]   If I just left it at today's passage,
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.540]   we wouldn't have had this command.
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.200]   But I wanted to include it so that you see
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.080]   how it's connected before we get lost in Noah's flood.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.000]   All right?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.040]   So the main imperative is arm yourselves
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.360]   with the same purpose.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.940]   That drove me nuts 'cause I'm like, what is the purpose?
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:28.000]   Right, there's a lot of purpose language in here too.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.640]   So it's a little bit of a challenge,
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:33.400]   but we're supposed to arm ourselves with the same purpose.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.080]   And then the third column and on,
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.760]   those are all subordinate ideas.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:42.240]   So this is how I visually make sure I set up my hedges
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.540]   so I'm not veering off, okay?
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.840]   So what I'm reading, mostly,
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.080]   we're gonna look at chapter three, verses 19 to 20.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.680]   I'm gonna read it again for you.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:59.700]   In which also he went and made proclamation
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.140]   to the spirits now in prison,
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.560]   who once were disobedient when the patience of God
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.180]   kept waiting in the days of Noah
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.500]   during the construction of the ark
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.940]   in which a few, that is eight persons,
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.020]   were brought safely through the water
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.420]   and corresponding to that baptism now.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:19.420]   Okay, so the four questions that are of significance today,
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:23.880]   'cause depending on how I answer these four questions,
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.720]   it's gonna lead me to interpretive conclusions.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.940]   So these are my four questions.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.520]   Who are the spirits?
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.740]   Second, what is this prison?
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:40.440]   Third, when did Christ preach, proclaim?
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.300]   Because it actually doesn't say in the passage.
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.020]   It doesn't say explicitly when that happened, okay?
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.900]   And then what did Christ preach and proclaim?
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:53.420]   Did he preach good news to people in hell?
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:58.640]   Did he preach to Noah and through Noah?
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.100]   Like, what is this?
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.100]   What did he preach?
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.700]   Okay, so those are the questions that kind of come to mind.
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:10.580]   And before we look at these questions in depth,
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:14.880]   I want us to look at the Noah context, okay, in Genesis 6.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.420]   I'm just gonna read this for you
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.780]   'cause this is pertinent to some of the conclusions
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.900]   you may draw.
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.840]   Now it came about, and this is after chapter four and five
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.660]   are genealogies, okay?
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.520]   Chapter four and five, full of genealogies,
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.580]   right before the flood.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.640]   Okay, now here's chapter six.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.080]   Now it came about when men began to multiply
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.240]   on the face of the land and daughters were born to them
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.520]   that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.380]   were beautiful and they took wives for themselves,
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:46.540]   whomever they chose.
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.840]   Then the Lord said, "My spirit shall not strive
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.700]   "with man forever because he also is flesh.
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:55.780]   "Nevertheless, his days shall be 120 years."
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.680]   The Nephilim were on the earth in those days
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.020]   and also afterward, numbers 13,
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:05.520]   when the sons of God came into the daughters of men
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.680]   and they bore children to them.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.660]   Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:16.840]   Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.960]   was great on the earth that every intent
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.900]   of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:29.640]   I think it was worse than how we are today, okay?
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.620]   It's pretty bad.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.480]   The Lord was sorry that he had made man on the earth
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.500]   and he was grieved in his heart and the Lord said,
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.940]   "I will blot out man whom I have created
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.340]   "from the face of the land, from man to animals,
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.960]   "to creeping things and to birds of the sky,
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.280]   "for I am sorry that I have made them."
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.920]   But Noah, that's a huge but.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.840]   That's a very important grammatical word, but Noah, okay?
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:01.760]   But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.280]   These are the records of the generations of Noah.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.540]   Noah was a righteous man, not perfect,
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:12.480]   righteous man, blameless in his time
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.160]   and Noah walked with God.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.720]   The only other person prior to this
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.920]   where it said he walked with God was Enoch.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.440]   So Noah was a stud, all right?
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.400]   So that's the context and there's all kinds of questions
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.800]   that scholars debate on just this passage too, all right?
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.680]   So the first question is who are these spirits?
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.680]   And the Greek word here for spirit is pneuma, okay?
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.200]   So here are some options that I can conclude in my head.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:48.000]   Okay, so they're departed souls of righteous believers
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.760]   of the Old Testament, okay?
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.200]   They're trapped in some form of limbo state.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:01.280]   But my mind kind of immediately almost wants to discount that
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.360]   because usually righteous people are never called
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.400]   disobedient in the scriptures, okay?
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.200]   But that's an option.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.600]   Another option is departed souls of ungodly and evil people
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.860]   who are in hell and these were these guys in Noah's day.
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:19.240]   All right, 'cause 2 Peter 2 says they're trapped
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.400]   in the prison waiting for judgment, okay?
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:28.320]   Third, some people say it's the loss of national Israel,
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:33.160]   the walking dead of Jesus' day,
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.500]   held prisoner by their unbelief.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:44.600]   The blue is kind of what I would lean toward, all right?
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.440]   They're angelic spirits in hell and they're bound demons
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:56.120]   partly because 2 Peter also describes them that way
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:01.120]   or so I feel, but mostly because 1 Peter 3.22
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:08.040]   talks about it and also a lot because pneuma
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:14.420]   is always used as a demon or a spirit,
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:18.520]   always cast out, right?
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.460]   These pneuma.
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.800]   So for me, it's difficult to find any place
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.780]   outside of there's one verse in Hebrews 12
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:32.780]   which is qualified where a human being is called a spirit.
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:41.940]   So that's, but again, my argument has holes, all right?
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.280]   But that's what I will loosely ascribe to.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.900]   Does that make sense?
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:51.580]   So the blue is kind of the conclusion that I'm landing on
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.880]   to the best of my ability.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:59.580]   Second question, what is this prison?
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:04.300]   Is it some sort of limbo state?
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.740]   It's a position held by the Catholics
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.880]   completely rejected by the Protestants.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:14.040]   Is this some kind of intermediary state?
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:19.080]   It's like kind of the edge outside parts of hell
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.080]   where people who did not hear the gospel proper
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.820]   actually kind of are waiting for a final judgment.
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.320]   Is that what that is, prison?
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.100]   Can it be sin and blindness?
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.360]   Because if I'm thinking that Jesus,
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:38.080]   when he proclaimed the liberty to the captives, okay,
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:43.080]   and that you would have to ascribe to the,
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.980]   well, if people are trapped in their unbelief
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.080]   in Jesus' current day,
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.480]   then I would have to say the prison is unbelief.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:56.000]   Or as most people will conclude,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.220]   it's some kind of a bottomless pit or hell,
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:03.380]   okay, where Satan himself is bound.
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:11.200]   So then the question is, did Jesus go to hell
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.800]   with some kind of preaching assignment?
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:21.560]   It's a little uncomfortable to think that, right?
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:26.560]   If this prison is hell, did Jesus go in there
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.140]   with some kind of preaching task?
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.800]   Where was Jesus' spirit
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.380]   between Good Friday and Easter Sunday?
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.900]   Is this where he was?
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.920]   But then while he's receiving the full brunt
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   of the wrath of holy, holy, holy God, was he preaching?
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.480]   There's questions.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:55.680]   In response to the Gnostic teachings
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.380]   that were in the early church,
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:01.880]   the early church fathers came up
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:05.760]   with a Trinitarian doctrine or a creed
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.880]   where every believer, when they were getting baptized,
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.800]   would actually recite it.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.720]   It would go something like this.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.240]   I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.720]   maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ,
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.040]   his only son, our Lord.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.120]   You got, what is that?
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.420]   Anybody know what that is?
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:24.520]   That's the Apostles' Creed.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.660]   And some of you guys might have grown up in a church
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.880]   where that creed was read,
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.680]   but that originally started as something
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.760]   that was recited at every baptism,
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:39.000]   but even the Apostles' Creed changed over the years
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.980]   because of these questions.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:44.040]   I'm gonna compare the original form,
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.680]   which is what's called the Old Roman form.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.640]   The earliest writings we find by a guy
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:53.160]   named Bishop Marcellus of Acheron.
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.680]   That's the first record.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.120]   There is no descended into hell there.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:03.140]   But if you look at Sirmium's account later in 8359,
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.780]   Jesus descends into hell, and that becomes a doctrine.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.000]   Today, depending on what church you go to,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.700]   some churches leave it out, some churches leave it in.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.120]   And actually, I think from my understanding,
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.760]   all Catholics have that in there.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:26.020]   Okay, so this is a very interesting doctrine.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:29.040]   Where was Jesus between Good Friday and Easter Sunday,
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:33.600]   and did he go to this prison which was hell?
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:38.340]   Because it's not like this is all over the scriptures.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:42.600]   So that, when you're looking at this,
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.200]   it should feel a little uncomfortable, right?
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.000]   You don't wanna get this wrong.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.680]   So the two questions that we already covered
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.720]   that I just kinda walked you through briefly is,
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.720]   who are the spirits?
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.920]   What is this prison?
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:04.180]   The next two questions are in terms of what he preached.
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:08.020]   So the next question is, when did Christ preach,
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:11.660]   and when did Christ, or make a proclamation?
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:18.360]   Some people will say that he preached
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.840]   as the Spirit of the Lord, 'cause he had done that before
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.720]   in different times in the Old Testament,
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.680]   where he's preaching through Noah.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.840]   For 100-ish years, he's preaching through Noah
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.760]   to those wicked, wicked people,
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.560]   giving them opportunities to repent.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.980]   But just from the verse structure, I reject that,
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:44.040]   because, well, it says he went participle,
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.760]   and then in verse 22, he had gone.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.680]   So there's physical movement.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:54.140]   But when did Jesus preach this, then?
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:56.800]   If he did not move at all,
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.240]   and he's just preaching through Noah.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.960]   So that's one conclusion you can draw.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:04.360]   Another conclusion you can draw is that,
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:09.040]   after his resurrection, during the time when he was there,
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:13.440]   he was making proclamation before the ascension
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.900]   to people still in bondage to their sin.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:21.960]   But that's like, but what does that have to do with Noah?
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:28.760]   For me, I will loosely ascribe to,
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.520]   he made this proclamation sometime
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.240]   between his death and resurrection,
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.700]   between Friday and Sunday.
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.520]   But the text doesn't tell me when that happened.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:41.880]   There is no when this happened in the text.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.360]   So it's another challenge.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.880]   I feel super uncomfortable teaching right now.
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.180]   Hopefully, you guys feel super uncomfortable
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.220]   thinking through these things,
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.020]   'cause you don't wanna get it wrong.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:59.280]   And what did he preach and proclaim?
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:06.900]   So the word here is keruso, which is a proclamation.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:10.380]   It's a heralding of sorts.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:15.100]   It's a hear ye, hear ye, right?
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:19.220]   A king's herald will go into a city saying,
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:24.220]   hear ye, hear ye, these are the new decrees from said king.
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:30.140]   Or, hey, everybody, I am here on behalf of the king
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:33.700]   to tell you that we had victory over there in Carthage.
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.860]   That's what a heralding proclamation is.
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:40.500]   A lot of times, this is confusing,
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:44.700]   because in next week's passage, in chapter four, verse six,
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.820]   he uses the word euangelizo,
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.680]   which is to preach the good news.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.980]   So, Najareth, if you can understand why this is very,
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.500]   it can be a little bit problematic
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.060]   in terms of the interpretation.
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.140]   Here is a proclamation.
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:03.260]   Next week's passage, there's a preaching of good news.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.540]   Are the people the one and the same?
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:06.500]   Are they different groups?
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:10.600]   So that's another tension that's gonna be there
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.060]   when we look at next week's study.
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:16.020]   So did he preach the gospel message to those in prison?
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:22.060]   Because theologically, my mind goes to,
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:23.700]   did he ever give anybody
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.440]   who's already in hell a second chance?
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:30.200]   (audience members murmuring)
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.800]   Do you guys understand that question?
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.240]   Like, has he ever preached,
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:38.920]   has anyone from hell, biblically,
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.720]   been converted into heaven?
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:49.660]   This would be a strange assignment for Jesus to do that.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:57.600]   Or, as most modern-day scholars would lead to believe,
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:03.820]   is that he's declaring triumph.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:08.120]   He's declaring triumph over sin, over death,
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.800]   over hell, demons, and Satan himself.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.160]   He came to destroy the work of Satan,
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.120]   and the work of Satan was destroyed.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.680]   So that's what he's proclaiming.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.040]   But that interpretation,
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.840]   you would have to hold a little bit loosely.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.720]   Okay?
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:34.400]   And the flood in Noah's time,
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.340]   it wiped out everybody.
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:40.600]   Right?
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.900]   Did it wipe out sin?
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.120]   It did not.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.960]   Was sin defeated at the flood?
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.000]   No, it wasn't.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.120]   Because you see, pretty much, in Genesis 8 and 9,
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:56.320]   there's all kinds of sin amongst these eight people.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.200]   There's drunkenness, there's all kinds of shame.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.220]   So people are that corrupt,
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:06.720]   even these righteous people, these eight.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.440]   All right?
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:13.440]   So, this is a passage where it's a little bit,
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:17.160]   you wanna tread very carefully as to what all this means.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:20.280]   So, who are the prisoners?
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.600]   Or who are the spirits?
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.520]   What is this prison?
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.040]   What did, when did Christ preach and proclaim?
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.480]   What did Christ preach and proclaim?
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.480]   These are all questions that have been
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:34.360]   baffling people for years.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:36.860]   So if you're here like, I got the right answer.
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:40.920]   Yeah, the Lord be with you.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.480]   Okay?
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:45.000]   Now, I'm gonna look at,
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.720]   we've talked about in the past,
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:49.280]   when you have a passage that can be sensitive,
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.160]   whether it's women issues,
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.840]   or Christians to government issues,
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.640]   and all kinds of these things,
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.640]   that you don't wanna just look at one verse in isolation.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.200]   You also wanna see what else is being said
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.680]   in the New Testament.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:07.120]   And so, I'm gonna just look at 2 Peter
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.240]   to broaden the context a little,
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:13.280]   to see if there are things that we can glean from in here.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.080]   I don't have any particular conclusions,
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.600]   but this is 2 Peter 2, four to five.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:24.200]   For if God did not spare angels when they sinned,
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.920]   but cast them into hell and committed them
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.060]   to pits of darkness reserved for judgment,
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:34.560]   and he did not spare the ancient world,
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.240]   but preserved Noah,
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:40.240]   a herald of righteousness,
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.680]   with seven others,
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.400]   when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly,
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.820]   also he continues toward the end,
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:51.040]   know this first of all,
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.920]   that in the last days,
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.520]   mockers will come with their mocking,
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.360]   following after their own lusts,
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:02.280]   and saying, where is the promise of his coming?
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.360]   Ever since the fathers fell asleep,
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:07.640]   all continues just as it was
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.320]   from the beginning of creation.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.640]   For when they maintain this,
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.120]   it escapes their notice that by the word of God,
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.600]   the heavens existed long ago,
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.400]   and the earth was formed out of water and by water,
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:24.440]   through which the world at that time was destroyed,
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.940]   being flooded with water.
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:28.120]   But by his word,
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.160]   the present heavens and earth are being reserved now
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.880]   for fire,
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.400]   kept for the day of judgment
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.720]   and destruction of ungodly men.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.740]   But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved,
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:41.620]   that with the Lord,
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:42.960]   one day is like a thousand years,
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:45.260]   and a thousand years like one day.
[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:47.520]   The Lord is not slow about his promise
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.660]   as some count slowness,
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.660]   but is patient toward you,
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:53.900]   not wishing for any to perish,
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:57.660]   but for all to come to repentance.
[00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:01.900]   Now for me, it helped,
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:03.940]   and then it didn't,
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:04.780]   to read this,
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:05.680]   'cause it's like, okay,
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.080]   I have more info,
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:10.560]   but it doesn't necessarily lead me to a set conclusion.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.440]   I have a leaning, right?
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:18.440]   So in order not to get just lost,
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:22.960]   just in the details, okay?
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:27.520]   Here are the main takeaways from the passage on the whole,
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.340]   including next,
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:31.600]   I was gonna put all the way to chapter four, verse seven,
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:33.820]   but I figured that was too much text,
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.900]   but it's gonna continue to next week.
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:40.340]   The suffering of believers
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.580]   is attributed to the will of God.
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.980]   That's something we can glean from this section.
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:47.440]   You guys get that?
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.160]   If you suffer, God meant it.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:53.900]   Okay?
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:55:00.120]   But it's a whole lot better to suffer for doing right
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:03.580]   than for doing wrong.
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:04.420]   Okay?
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:07.460]   But God, there's nothing out of his control.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:09.060]   He wills suffering.
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:12.460]   The second truth,
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:16.540]   even though Jesus suffered according to the will of God,
[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:19.500]   he was ultimately vindicated by God.
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:23.300]   So he's got everything in control.
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:24.660]   Sin has been defeated.
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:27.520]   Third takeaway,
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:31.980]   believers like Noah are the righteous minority
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:36.980]   living in a scornful, hostile, unbelieving world.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:43.200]   You will suffer because you're out of place,
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.640]   because the world hates you,
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:48.860]   because the darkness hates the light,
[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:52.020]   because Satan hates you and wants you destroyed.
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:56.200]   He is disgusted by every single one of us.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:59.220]   So we're living in that.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:04.900]   Another takeaway from the six verses
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:09.900]   is believers like Jesus and Noah will be vindicated by God.
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:17.340]   And it made me think of Philippians 2.10,
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:20.940]   but just for the whole passage, for context.
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:23.580]   For this reason also,
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:26.140]   God highly exalted him and bestowed on him
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:28.620]   the name which is above every name,
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:30.700]   so that at the name of Jesus,
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:34.120]   every knee will bow of those who are in heaven
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.460]   and on earth and under the earth,
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:38.720]   and that every tongue will confess
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:43.720]   that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:50.580]   So hopefully I didn't make it more confusing.
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:54.340]   My hope was that it brings a little bit of clarity
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:59.340]   as to the hedges of how we're supposed to handle this text.
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:04.460]   But like I've said before, this is a challenging text.
[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:08.580]   So hold to your conclusions lightly and with humility,
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:09.560]   but with zeal.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.900]   I don't know what that looks like,
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.620]   but do the best that you can to do that, okay?
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.860]   So this is for next Wednesday.
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:22.860]   It's gonna be a little less tricky,
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:25.180]   but still it's gonna continue.
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:29.420]   Chapters four, verses one through six.
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:31.300]   After that, the interpretive things
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:34.500]   become a little bit less taxing.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:37.500]   So after next week, it becomes a little bit less
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.620]   in terms of, like, this is meant,
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:41.980]   my brain can't handle this.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:46.180]   But the application for next week is,
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.900]   are you living according to the will of God
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:50.580]   or according to the lust of the flesh?
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:53.940]   And that's something that I challenge you
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:55.540]   to think through and prepare.
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:56.620]   I mean, it's not necessarily you're gonna have
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:59.860]   to share it with everybody, but think through this.
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:02.460]   Because if this is just an academic exercise,
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:07.260]   this is a little bit of a, I don't wanna say a waste,
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:09.620]   but you're not gleaning as much as you ought.
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:15.480]   And for today, the rest of the time,
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.180]   I'm gonna give you guys to discuss, all right?
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:19.680]   And I'm not gonna come back up.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:22.780]   So it's just gonna be, you're gonna discuss,
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.100]   and then you're gonna share, and then you're gonna pray,
[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:27.260]   and you're gonna say hallelujah, and then go home,
[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:29.060]   driving safely, all right?
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:34.060]   So the first two are the same, but the third question,
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:37.940]   in what ways, since your baptism
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:40.220]   into Christ's death and resurrection,
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:46.140]   in what ways, okay, this is grammatically bad.
[00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:47.500]   In what ways, since your baptism
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.140]   into Christ's death and resurrection,
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:52.660]   has your faith impacted your relationships,
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:54.780]   your life goals, and your day-to-day interactions
[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:56.020]   with the hostile Christian world?
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.940]   You guys understand what I mean, right?
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.400]   Okay, I seriously was prepping this until like 547.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:07.020]   The second one, is there suffering currently in your life?
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:10.280]   In what ways can your group members pray for you,
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.500]   keep you accountable, and help you persevere?
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:16.800]   And those are the questions that hopefully should fill up
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:19.980]   the bulk of the remainder of our time.
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:21.480]   All right, let me pray for us.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:29.700]   Lord, we need you to walk us through these truths,
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:35.720]   and you've said, Lord, if any of us lacks wisdom,
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:39.140]   that we should ask, and that you will give generously,
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:44.140]   and without reproach, that we must believe without doubting.
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:48.980]   So help us not to be like those who are driven
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:51.600]   and tossed by the surf of the wind,
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:55.960]   but help us to be those who are anchored in Christ,
[00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:00.320]   zealous for the truth, and yet humble before one another,
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.800]   and especially before this text.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.560]   And we pray that your spirit would guide us
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:09.560]   into all truth this evening, which ultimately is,
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:15.080]   we were made by you and for you to love and serve you.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.840]   And so would you help us to be fueled and fed
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.440]   by the study of your word tonight?
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.600]   In Jesus' name we pray.
