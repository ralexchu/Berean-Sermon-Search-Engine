[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.480]   - Well, to be a Christian is a wonderful thing.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.760]   It's the greatest thing, in fact.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.780]   To find forgiveness in the cross of our Savior,
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.560]   to be united to Christ by His Spirit,
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.480]   to have the Father as our own Father,
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.780]   and to commune with Him as His child.
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.440]   These are the greatest gifts a creature can receive,
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.680]   and so we give thanks.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.080]   And yet we also look forward to our resurrection
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.860]   and to new bodies that will enjoy God forever
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.200]   without any sinful impediments,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.600]   to our giving God all the glory He is worthy
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.200]   to receive from us, and in that,
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.800]   experiencing the fullest possible joy
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.600]   we can experience in ourselves.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.600]   Cannot wait.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.440]   But for now, we wait.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.620]   Because for all the incredible gifts and blessings
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.200]   we now have in Christ, to be a Christian in this life
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.360]   doesn't mean we are free from our disordered loves.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.200]   We're not.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.200]   We're not.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.360]   And every Christian feels it, feels an ongoing civil war
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.200]   on the inside in our twisted loves and longings.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.680]   We both love God, and we find in us the remains
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.920]   of a treasonous impulse against the God we love
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.080]   and our attraction to sin.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.120]   The Bible explains this civil war.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.640]   Arguably, Romans 7, verses 14 to 25 makes the point.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.960]   Less arguably, Galatians 5, 16 to 17
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.080]   makes the same point, too.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.000]   So then, what do we do as Christians,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.600]   redeemed by Christ's blood, sealed by the Spirit,
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.800]   adopted by the Father?
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.960]   What do we do with the disordered loves
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.000]   that we still find at work inside of us?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.080]   Pastor John explained at the end of a sermon
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.600]   on Romans chapter seven, preached in 2001,
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.640]   here he is drawing out pastoral application.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.060]   - In view of all that the Bible says to us
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.060]   about our condition, our fallen condition
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.680]   with this body of death, and our sinful condition
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.080]   with the body acting in treason to join forces
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.360]   with the power of sin to tempt us,
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.880]   in view of the fact that there's a law of sin still active
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.320]   and there's a body of death,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.320]   we should not be surprised or thrown off balance
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.480]   when we meet in ourselves and in our children
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.380]   and in our spouses and in our loved ones
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.880]   and in our colleagues and our roommates and our neighbors
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.420]   some really excessive and distorted bodily desires.
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:50.520]   Let me give you some examples
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.720]   and then say how I think we should respond.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.320]   Remember, we are being redeemed in stages.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.160]   Guilt is taken away right now.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.400]   All your sins are forgiven right now.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.040]   The Holy Spirit is dwelling in your life by faith
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.180]   if you're a believer right now.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.120]   No condemnation is hanging over you at all right now.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.880]   And yet we wait for the redemption of our bodies
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.360]   and those bodies are bodies of death
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.720]   and places where sin sets up a base of operations often
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.720]   and tempts us with excessive and distorted bodily desires.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:44.600]   For example, we see excessive desires for leisure,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.840]   tempting us to laziness and sloth.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.760]   We see excessive desires for food,
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   tempting us to gluttony and all of its damaging effects.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.300]   We see excessive desires for drink,
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.240]   tempting us to alcoholism.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.560]   We see excessive desires for sex,
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.940]   tempting us to lustfulness and fornication and adultery.
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.940]   And on top of all of those excessive desires,
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.860]   this law of sin operating in our members
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.460]   produces distorted desires.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.300]   That shouldn't surprise us either.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.460]   The whole world is bent out of shape under the fall.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.060]   That's much of the point of Romans 1 to 3.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.860]   It's much of the point of part of Romans 8.
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.860]   For example, we see distorted desires for food.
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.260]   My father-in-law treated people before he died
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.020]   who had this incredible hankering
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.120]   for gray river clay in Georgia.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.340]   They ate clay until it filled their bowels
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.980]   and they died.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.300]   He would warn them not to take laxatives
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.660]   because it would kill them.
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.740]   Why would anybody wanna eat clay?
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.300]   Or the whole issue of binging bags of cookies and so on.
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.900]   Those are distortions of a good thing
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.620]   called appetite, desire.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.540]   Or we know about distorted desires of sex.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.980]   The desire to have satisfaction with one of your own sex,
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.980]   whether homosexuality or lesbianism or bisexuality
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.460]   is one of many kinds of fallen distortions.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.140]   Another example would be the distortions of desire
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.140]   for pleasure, a kind of high,
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.140]   and people resort to marijuana or speed or cocaine or LSD.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.420]   Why?
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.620]   What are these distortions,
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.860]   these artificial ways of getting some kind of satisfaction
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.900]   and happiness?
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.500]   The world is just shot through our bodies.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.780]   These bodies of death are shot through
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.740]   with excessive desires and distorted desires.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.260]   There's not a person in this room
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.820]   who doesn't have one of those.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.540]   Now, what do we do?
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.620]   I'm calling you, pleading with you week after week
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.340]   for a biblical realism in Jesus Christ.
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.220]   In Christ, by faith, we are united to him.
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:01.180]   Before any of this is fixed, you hear this now,
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.180]   by faith, we become united to Jesus, faith alone.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.180]   We are united to him and his purchase pardon
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.220]   becomes perfectly ours and his perfect righteousness
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.620]   close this excessively desiring,
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.540]   distortedly desiring body.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.780]   First, this is the gospel.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.220]   Now, what's the issue there?
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.380]   The issue in your life, believer,
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.380]   is not do I have excessive desires
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.940]   or do I have distorted desires?
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.060]   I say it with joy in my heart
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.060]   for those of you who struggle with homosexuality
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:56.060]   or with eating disorders or with drugs
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.660]   or with laziness.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.420]   I say it with joy in my heart.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.940]   The issue is not whether you have those excessive
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.900]   and distorted desires.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.620]   The issue is, will you say,
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.300]   who will deliver me from this body of death
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.820]   and look away from yourself and your resources
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.300]   and say, thanks be to God through Jesus Christ
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.020]   who gives the victory to the world.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:33.020]   And will you not make peace
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.660]   with the law of sin
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:41.660]   and find yourself at home in the body of death,
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:46.820]   but rather make war all your life
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:52.380]   until your body is finally redeemed at the resurrection.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.260]   That's the issue.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.380]   That's the issue.
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.580]   So you walk up to me at the end of the service
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:05.340]   in five minutes and say with trembling,
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.500]   I'd like you to pray for me
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.260]   because I've never told anybody,
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.540]   but I really struggle with homosexuality.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.100]   I'm not gonna be surprised.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.420]   Happens a lot.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:22.420]   You say to me, nobody knows about what I'm doing with food.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.340]   Nobody knows.
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.620]   I'm not gonna be surprised.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.740]   Nothing surprises me anymore.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.940]   But I will call you to a massive hope
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.780]   that through faith there is justification
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.860]   and through faith there is forgiveness.
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.100]   And then by that same Christ comes incrementally,
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.900]   sometimes in leaps and bounds
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.060]   and sometimes through long, agonizing, wrestling,
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.180]   a triumph that will be secured in the last day
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.140]   because of the blood of Jesus.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.060]   - Powerful, Pastor Rall, application taken
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.340]   from the end of John Piper's sermon
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.700]   preached on August 19th, 2001.
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.820]   A sermon titled, "Who is this divided man?"
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.980]   Part five.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.020]   Part of a series on Romans chapter seven, verses 14 to 25,
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.700]   which raises again the ongoing debate
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.140]   over whether or not Romans seven
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.980]   is speaking of the struggles of a believer
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.780]   or the struggles of a pre-believer.
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.380]   Pastor John says, of course, believer,
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.900]   but we've only briefly talked about that debate here
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.900]   in APJ's 802, 1183, and 1438, for what it's worth.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.180]   But we should cover that in the future more directly.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.100]   But this is a great clip from a listener
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.740]   with this note, "Dear Pastor John and the APJ team,
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.940]   "hello, my name is Svetlana and I live in Greece

[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.580]   "If you have a clip, email me.

[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.800]   "If it did, put the word clip
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.640]   "in the subject line of an email

[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.080]   Well, speaking of our bodies,
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.600]   can we make ourselves more holy
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.320]   if we treat our bodies more harshly?
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.400]   It's a great question about asceticism,
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.400]   and it's up next time.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.280]   and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.120]   See you then.
