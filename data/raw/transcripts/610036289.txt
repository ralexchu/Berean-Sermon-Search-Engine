[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 13 and we're going to be reading from
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.200]   verse 1 through 6 this morning.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.280]   Proper response to God's grace.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.100]   Hebrews chapter 13 verses 1 through 6.
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.560]   Our main focus this morning is going to be on the first verse.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.840]   Hebrews chapter 13 verses 1 through 6 reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.440]   Let love of the brethren continue.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.160]   Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for by this some have entertained angels without
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.760]   knowing it.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.600]   Remember the prisoners as though in prison with them and those who are ill treated since
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.200]   you yourselves also are in the body.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.520]   Marriage is to be held in honor among all and the marriage bed is to be undefiled for
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.080]   fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.560]   Make sure that your character is free from the love of money being content with what
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.840]   you have for he himself has said I will never desert you nor will I ever forsake you so
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.320]   that we confidently say the Lord is my helper I will not be afraid.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.360]   What will man do to me?
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.560]   Let's pray.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.560]   Christian loving father we pray that you would anoint this time that your word and your word
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.000]   alone Lord God would be heard and that our hearts may be softened and that our lives
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.880]   may be changed.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.840]   Encourage us strengthen us rebuke us this morning by your word in Jesus name we pray
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.840]   amen.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.400]   Let me start off this morning by asking a rhetorical question so don't answer it okay
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.680]   don't even remember it because I don't want you to say something wrong okay so the question
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.280]   is if you had a choice between what kind of church you want to belong to you want to go
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.320]   to a church where they are known for their grace or do you want to go to a church that's
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.840]   known for their holiness?
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.840]   Don't answer that question.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.120]   Let me ask you again what church would you want to belong to a church that is known for
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.760]   their grace or a church that's known for their holiness?
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.640]   I don't want you to answer that question because generally speaking I already know the answer
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.720]   because I've had so many conversations in the past where even with other pastors that
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.640]   they have said that I'd rather err on the side of grace than to err on the side of being
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.940]   too harsh.
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.600]   It sounds godly on the surface because who wouldn't want to be at a church where they're
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.480]   known to be gracious because when you say I go to a church where they're known for their
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.520]   holiness automatically we think of judgment right everybody is like examining one another
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.560]   and you got to jump through hoops to belong to that group and so it sounds godly it almost
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:06.240]   sounds biblical to say I'd rather err on the side of grace but the biblical truth is to
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.200]   err on the side of grace is error and that's why I said I would rather err no error is
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.600]   error and the problem is if you look at the Old Testament false prophets the primary rebuke
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.520]   to the false prophets was they kept on telling them peace peace when there is no peace he
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.320]   was teaching grace God loves you unconditionally he forgives your sins and he kept on saying
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.600]   peace peace while the true prophets were coming and warning them if you do not turn from your
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.760]   sin God was going to bring judgment let me make this very clear there is never a time
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.400]   where God does something where he chooses to rather be gracious and to be than to be
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.880]   holy God who cannot lie cannot change his mind will never do anything that contradicts
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:08.880]   his nature God is holy holy holy and he is love he is love nothing that he does will
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.280]   contradict either side and that's the whole point of the cross the whole point of the
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.760]   cross is where God's justice and his mercy and love came in to union a perfect union
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.080]   without contradicting one or the other we have a tendency to think that holiness and
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.120]   love is on the opposite side and we need to somehow balance this sometimes we emphasize
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.840]   holiness sometimes we emphasize love and then sometimes we get it wrong sometimes we get
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:44.160]   it right but the accurate biblical understanding of God's justice and his love they always
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:52.480]   go hand in hand the cross if you err on the side of grace you don't need the cross because
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.280]   all God has to say is okay I'm just going to forget it I know you guys been sinning
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.900]   but this time I'm going to pretend like I didn't see it just sweep it under the rug
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.400]   right if we err on the side of grace we would allow all kinds of sin and say well because
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.240]   I'm being gracious because we're being gentle and merciful we're just going to pretend like
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.360]   it never happened just kind of sweep it under the rug if we err on the side of just justice
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.160]   we don't need the cross either because as soon as somebody sins they get what they deserve
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.160]   and they get punished and the end so the cross is the perfect union of God's justice and
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:36.080]   his mercy that came together that God's justice was satisfied to magnify his grace so to be
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:43.080]   gospel centered is not simply to be gracious to be gospel centered is to have the perfect
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:51.960]   union that we see at the cross where God's holiness and his love is in perfect display
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.360]   and so we have to make sure that we don't embrace one or the other simply because of
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.800]   our own personal prejudice that whatever it is that we practice in our personal lives
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.840]   and in the life of the church is a clear reflection of who God is and what he displayed on the
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.400]   cross this morning we're going to be looking at one verse it's in it's the first verse
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.440]   of many verses that are coming in in chapter 13 we have 13 imperatives here in light of
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.520]   all that we have been taught about who Jesus is he says this is how you ought to live and
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.800]   so in the first line alone I think there are several things that I want to highlight here
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.240]   because because it is so important in application right we have 13 chapters in the book of Hebrews
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.040]   12 chapters of telling us why we shouldn't drift it was giving us motivation because
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:48.080]   I know some of us who are impatient with theology just kind of you know just just tell us you
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.480]   know just briefly what it means and then tell us what we ought to do because we're practical
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.520]   people we're type a personality and so we want to get things done so some of us are
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.440]   a little bit impatient when we start to get dig too deep into theology say that's for
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.040]   pastors and theologians but for the rest of us just tell us what I'm supposed to do on
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.640]   Monday right and you probably hated the book of Hebrews because it's 12 chapters of telling
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:17.000]   us why we shouldn't drift because they were neglecting such a great salvation he was re-explaining
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.380]   in 12 chapters of this great salvation that if you drift this is what you're drifting
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:29.800]   from and then now that he concluded that therefore this is how you ought to live and so for the
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.260]   next few weeks maybe a few months we're going to be in this chapter describing the application
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:42.400]   of this grace in our lives but the most important of these is in the first one let love of the
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.440]   brethren continue so there's about five things I want to highlight about love in this text
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.520]   first of all love is what sets us apart from the world do you remember we talked about
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:59.520]   last week the word holy the root basic understanding of the word holy is what to be set apart from
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:05.280]   set apart to distinguish from what is common that whether it was an animal whether it
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:11.000]   was an article once it was taken from the common area and then placed at the temple
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.840]   for God's use it became holy so clothing became holy bowls became holy animals became holy
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:25.800]   because it was set apart what causes us to be holy to be set apart the greatest that
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:33.320]   sets us apart from the rest of the world he says is love John chapter 13 34 to 35 Jesus
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:39.200]   says to his disciples a new commandment I give to you right a new commandment I give
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.160]   to you that in and of itself is strange because do you see this commandment in the Old Testament
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:51.760]   where he says to love your neighbor yes all throughout the Old Testament Old Testament
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:58.400]   God tells his people to love his neighbor in Leviticus 19 18 it says you shall love
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.200]   you shall not take vengeance nor bear any grudge against the sons of the people but
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:09.120]   you shall love your neighbor as yourself I am the Lord right and I could I could give
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.240]   you you know dozens of passages where Jesus or God repeats the same thing to love your
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.640]   neighbor so why does Jesus say to his disciples a new commandment I gave to you clearly it's
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:26.000]   not new this is what was taught but you have to read the rest of what he says a new commandment
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.840]   I give to you that you love one another even as what I have loved you you love one another
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.040]   that's the new commandment the new commandment isn't simply to love one another because God's
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.320]   been telling his people to love the aliens love the strangers love your neighbors but
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:49.760]   Jesus is saying the love that I practice with you but this is the distinguishing mark so
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.720]   it's not simply love that distinguishes us from the world it's the quality of this love
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:02.480]   that distinguishes us from the world because the world practices love yes or no yeah of
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:08.520]   course they do your co-workers they practice love your non-christian friends Christian
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:14.760]   or not they practice love you you didn't have non-christian friends that loved you non-christian
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:21.400]   mother and fathers they don't love their children the world practices love but he wasn't saying
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:28.760]   just any love he says as I have loved you the quality of this love is what distinguishes
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.400]   you and the world will know you are my disciples if you practice this love well what's the
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:41.680]   distinction naturally we all tend to in our flesh love those who are lovable love those
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.600]   who are close to us love those who can benefit us love those who don't hurt us but the Bible
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:54.000]   says in Romans 5 8 God demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.600]   Christ loved us he loved us when we didn't deserve it he loved us when we were in rebellion
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:08.840]   he loved us when we had nothing to give while we were still blaspheming and resisting he
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:14.320]   said he his love he laid down for sinners who did not deserve and he said if you practice
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.400]   that love see if we practice the love that the world practices we're no different some
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   of us are better at it than others but the kind of love that distinguishes us from the
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.320]   rest of the world the world will not understand why would you make an effort to love that
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:41.440]   guy that guy's slandering you that guy hurt you what benefit do you have from doing that
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.880]   and so it's the kind of love that the world cannot understand and when they see us practicing
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:51.800]   that love he they will look at us and say oh it's because Jesus did it they're doing
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:58.660]   what Jesus did for them see first John 2 10 it says the one who loves his brother abides
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:05.360]   in the light and there is no cause for stumbling in him the greatest identifier of a Christian
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:11.560]   is the one who practices this love you know don't be fooled just because you love your
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.000]   mom and your dad or your children or your good friends it's like okay I'm practicing
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.120]   love no he said the love he's asking us to practice love that identifies that's different
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:28.520]   than any other love it's to love people that are hard to love love people that you would
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:35.320]   not normally love if you weren't affected by the love of Christ he said that is evidence
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:45.200]   that you have met Christ in if you remember John right John before he met the resurrected
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:52.320]   Christ do you remember what John and James was known for they were called sons of thunder
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.200]   and they weren't sons of thunder because they were big guys you know every time they walked
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.000]   around the earth shook that wasn't why they were sons of thunder sons of thunder because
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.960]   they had a bad temper remember as they were going through Samaria and the Samaritans wouldn't
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:14.020]   help right and he got angry and he said Lord do you want me to pray to kill all these people
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:19.640]   right this guy was would have been a mass murderer but in the New Testament what is
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:29.400]   Apostle John known for Apostle of love he writes more about love than any other Apostle
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:35.000]   in the Gospel of John first and second John right he writes more about love than any other
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.720]   Apostle so he's known as the Apostle if you want to learn about love you got to go to
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:46.400]   the Gospel of John because he exposit love in his writings how did the sons of thunder
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.520]   a potential mass murderer and all they did was they just didn't want to help they should
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:14:00.680]   I kill all these people it's because he met the resurrected Christ a Christ even after
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:06.120]   he was crucified and mocked even after his disciples all took off even after one of his
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:12.480]   disciples betrayed him Jesus resurrects and this was all part of his agape love to save
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:19.760]   the world and you could tell John you know the lights going off it's not just John right
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:25.760]   Apostle Peter all the lights are going off because they could not understand why would
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:33.540]   the King of Kings and Lord of Lords lay down his life for us they could not fathom it until
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:39.560]   he actually did it and so his disciples began to understand that oh that's what he meant
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.760]   when he got on his knees to serve if you want to be the greatest in the kingdom of God who
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.240]   could use the greatest in the kingdom of God but Jesus himself and he got on his knees
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.240]   and he served and so Jesus said if you want to follow me you pick up the cross and you
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:15:01.080]   do the same you remember Apostle Paul another mass murderer right he says I'm the worst
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:07.360]   of sinners and he literally was because he was responsible for the first martyr in the
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.840]   book of Acts if that wasn't enough he was so angry he got a bunch of soldiers to go
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:18.680]   collect all these Christians he hated Christians he hated the Gentiles until he encounters
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:25.840]   the resurrected Christ and the very people that he tried so hard to extinguish he becomes
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:33.480]   the apostle to the Gentiles as a witness to the world that he wanted to be just wanted
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:39.560]   to destroy now he became the main mouthpiece to spread God's love to them and so there
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:45.840]   was evidence that must that man must have met Christ in fact the greatest witness in
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:55.640]   the early church was the church itself in Tertullian one of the early church fathers
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.640]   this is what he says about how the church was viewed and he was quoting a pagan authority
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:06.320]   this is what it says it is mainly the deeds of a love so noble that lead many to put a
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:12.040]   brand upon us see how they love one another they say how they are ready even to die for
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:19.440]   one another they say for they themselves will sooner be put to death he says he's just describing
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.400]   their reputation outside of the church in the early church the greatest evidence of
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:30.280]   the resurrection of Jesus Christ was the makeup of the church itself do you know how much
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:36.440]   the Pharisees hated tax collectors because they were the ones who betrayed their country
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:43.000]   they were collecting money from their countrymen and Matthew the tax collector and you had
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.360]   these fishermen who are walking around calling each other's brothers in Christ I mean in
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:54.200]   a typical setting they would have killed each other in the early church you had the tax
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.800]   collectors teaching because he was an apostle he was teaching converted Pharisees the experts
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:07.640]   of the law about the new covenant in Christ you had runaway slaves and slave owners in
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.880]   the same congregation you had the rich and poor they didn't have rich on one side of
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:17.120]   the one side of the you know neighborhood and then poor on the other side because clearly
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.040]   they're not going to be the fellowship because you if we have home groups you're going to
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.280]   one one day go to the mansion another day go to a hut so that's practically that's not
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.400]   going to work but the greatest evidence in the early church was all of them were together
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:38.200]   and they loved one another and so you can look at that and say well what happened right
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:45.160]   my their early leaders must have been fantastic leaders right they they tapped into the organization
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.760]   they were able to get people to put away their ego and and they learned a system where everybody
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:58.120]   can get along are you kidding me that's not what happened see the secular world can't
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:04.920]   explain the church and if you've ever read anything from the secular world how they describe
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.800]   why Christianity blew up so much they'll say oh because it was the poor people and there
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.360]   was a desperateness and Jesus described where they started to help each other and that's
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:19.800]   why the poor people came in droves that's because they don't they didn't study the early
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:25.120]   church the early church was filled with poor people rich people slave owners and slave
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:34.840]   Pharisees Sadducees tax collectors all in the same church and so the only logical explanation
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:40.400]   was the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's no different than if we fell asleep one day
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:47.280]   and the Republicans Democrats you know are they love each other what was so powerful
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:54.640]   that they came together right something people who hated they wouldn't even walk into their
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.920]   town because they hated each other and yet they call each other brothers and sisters
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:08.080]   in Christ because they met the resurrected Christ that's what distinguished them from
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.520]   rest of the world that's why it's so hard to understand how that happened in the early
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:21.420]   church so the greatest mark of holiness that sets us apart from the world is love second
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:26.680]   love is the greatest application of this community there's a reason why love is at the top of
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.720]   this list and if you I can sit here and go through passage after passage after passage
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.240]   after passage of the various lists of the characteristic of a Christian and almost always
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:45.720]   love is at the top of that list in first Corinthians chapter 13 verse 13 said but now faith hope
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:51.360]   love abide these things but the greatest of these is love right I know if you've been
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.200]   raising the church you memorize this first you might have a plaque on this at your home
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:01.840]   somewhere your children who probably may have memorized this in Sunday school but have you
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:10.760]   considered the gravity of this verse we're saved by faith we persevere through all kinds
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:22.920]   of trial because of hope and yet he says above faith above hope love is the greatest wow
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.600]   I mean that that really should cause us to take a step back and think about this because
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:35.160]   the greatest application of God's holy calling is love even though my relationship with God
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:41.200]   is reconciled because of faith and it is because of this hope that I'm able to be sanctified
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:48.000]   and yet the greatest application of our calling he says is love in second Peter 1 5 through
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.280]   8 Apostle Peter goes through the list of Christian disciplines that we ought to strive for and
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.080]   this is what he says now for this very reason also applying all diligence in your faith
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:02.200]   supply moral excellence in your moral excellence knowledge and in your knowledge self-control
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.000]   in your self-control perseverance and in your perseverance godliness and in your godliness
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.920]   brotherly kindness in your brotherly kindness love you notice here on this list that in
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:21.520]   descending order that these are the things that Christians who are trying to be sanctified
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:27.820]   should apply themselves increasing manner to grow in and he says moral excellence knowledge
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:34.640]   self-control perseverance godliness brotherly kindness and ultimately love the reason why
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:39.320]   love is at the bottom of this list is because all this striving is to ultimately get to
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:46.920]   love that the reason why we discipline is to get to love the reason why we knowledge
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:52.880]   is to get to love all the things that we are doing ultimately is to get us to practice
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.440]   the love that Christ practiced with us and that's what it means in first Timothy 1 5
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:03.200]   when Paul sends Timothy to go to war in the city of Ephesus because the Judaizers were
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:08.320]   coming and beginning to spread the false gospel and he's telling this young man do not be
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:14.800]   timid I give you the authority and the word command here is a military command where a
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.880]   commanding officer is telling the subordinate I'm commanding you to go and command these
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:26.200]   men to stop teaching false doctrines and I give you the authority as an apostle of Jesus
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:33.060]   Christ to go and fight and this Timothy you know he's concerned he's timid he has some
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:37.660]   ailments and you know people are falling out and and so Paul is trying to strengthen him
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:45.880]   up to go fight but as he goes to fight he says but remember the goal of our instruction
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:52.520]   is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith the reason why I need
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:58.720]   you to fight is so that you can establish love the reason why doctrine needs to be pure
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:04.400]   is so that we can have love the reason why you need to you need to make your stand clear
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.280]   is so that you can ultimately have greater love see in our generation because of the
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:16.380]   way that the gospel has been watered down that we somehow think that doctrinal purity
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:23.120]   and love somehow cannot coexist but the very reason why God calls us to purity in the church
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:30.180]   is so that we can have greater love these things are not two opposite sides you cannot
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:38.960]   have one without the other third we are called to love as we love ourselves the word here
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:45.320]   for love is Philadelphia Philadelphia has two words philo love Adelphia is brother but
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:52.000]   literally the word in Greek means of the same womb so the Greeks use this word Philadelphia
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   to only refer to blood brothers that you actually had a physical brother so the Christians adapted
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.360]   this to apply to all their true believers so this was a even though the word existed
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:11.200]   the way it was applied in the New Testament to New Covenant people is uniquely Christian
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:18.340]   and the reason why it was uniquely Christian is because that idea of family was applied
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:24.280]   to all true believers because we were all born by the same spirit so the Greeks used
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:29.000]   it to refer to people who are born of the same womb and the New Testament believers
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.880]   use it to all who are genuinely born again by the spirit and Jesus himself said when
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.240]   he was hanging on the cross and he was looking at his mother he looked at his the disciples
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.240]   and he said to the mother woman behold your son then he said to the disciples behold your
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:48.880]   mother from that hour the disciples took her into his own household so now you are true
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:55.600]   brothers that's your mother that's your father and so that our community is is actually our
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.800]   family Ephesians 4 4 to 5 there is one body one spirit just as you also called in one
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:06.920]   hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism and God and Father of all who is over
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:15.880]   all and through all and in all right now like the application of all this sound great but
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.520]   what is the application of all of this he says we are to love one another as we would
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.760]   love our own family members that's basically what it says right love the Lord you got with
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:31.520]   all your heart soul mind and straight love your neighbor as yourself when we talk about
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:37.520]   the practice of holiness or practice of grace we somehow detach these these two things and
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.160]   and I've had a friend tell me years ago that he believes that the greatest problem in our
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:47.280]   generation is that we don't practice church discipline that's the problem that we need
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.760]   to weed out sin we need to call out people who are in error and so we need to keep the
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:57.560]   church pure now I know what he was saying I know what he was getting in but I don't
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.160]   know if I would phrase it that way because I don't think it's accurate I think the way
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.480]   we should we should understand is the greatest problem our generation is that we don't practice
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:15.420]   true love because the kind of love that we practice sometimes is no more than indifference
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:20.640]   we have different degrees of how we practice love we have people that we really care about
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.920]   and we love them we rejoice with them and we suffer with them and so we have that group
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.440]   of people and then we have some groups of people we don't neither hate them or love
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.720]   them they're just kind of acquaintances so when they when good things happen we high
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:40.560]   five right and then when they suffer a sad face on Facebook but that's about the engagement
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:45.280]   that we have and then we have people that annoys us they're acquaintances so when they
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:52.640]   suffer we rejoice inwardly quietly because we're Christian and then when they celebrate
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:57.480]   we're kind of like how they don't deserve that so we have different degrees of love
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:08.120]   that we we practice but the people that we really love we're engaged no mother or father
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:13.360]   who sees a child deliberately choosing a path that they know is going to hurt them and sits
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:19.520]   there and say well I want to practice grace and mercy I'm just gonna let you do whatever
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.880]   you want to do because I rather err on the side of grace no one would look at that and
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.960]   say what a great mom what a great dad if your child is staying up till 4 in the morning
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.600]   playing video games 14 hours and and ruining their life and hanging out with the wrong
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.960]   crowd and and they're making decisions that ultimately gonna hurt them no loving mother
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.120]   no loving father is gonna sit there and watch it and say well I rather err on the side of
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:51.440]   grace you'd get involved if that was your brother if that was your sister if that was
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:58.120]   your mother or father because we love them we would we would be more concerned about
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:04.760]   the damage that they're doing to their life than how they would view us so sometimes our
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:10.880]   idea of practicing grace is being indifferent because we're afraid how they will react to
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:18.840]   what we will say but we don't do that to people we really love people that we really love
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:26.000]   we will say something despite how you may perceive me I will say something to you because
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.840]   I know and I'm convinced that if you keep going down that path that there is destruction
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:37.920]   there's no good waiting for you because we love them we will speak so the kind of grace
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:44.520]   that's that's supposedly being practiced in our generation is not grace at all it's just
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:49.240]   indifference and we're not doing it for them even though in the back of our mind we know
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:55.880]   where oh you go around he's gonna point out what's wrong you know so the problem in our
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:06.040]   generation is not that we don't practice church discipline we don't truly practice agape love
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:14.560]   because God's love and his grace cannot be separated if you practice one without the
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:23.680]   other it isn't from God if you practice justice without love you'll get vengeance if you practice
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.880]   grace without justice you have indifference just kind of ignore it let them be they're
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.400]   gonna do drugs let them do drugs they're gonna run down this path and at the end of it there's
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:39.000]   a cliff I don't want to bother them let them go you see God's justice and his mercy and
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.880]   his grace can never be separated and that's the community that he calls us to where the
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:52.240]   gospel of Jesus where the cross is at the center when cross is at the center his holiness
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:30:03.880]   and his love will never be compromised third sorry fourth love is not in us love is given
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:10.640]   to us you notice here he says to continue in my love he doesn't say practice love he
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:16.880]   says continue in my love the word for continue is a very theologically rich term and it's
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.820]   the word meno so if you've been at our church I've given several sermons on this on John
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:26.160]   chapter 15 when Jesus says if you want to if you want to bear fruit you need to remain
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:33.480]   in me right remain me continue in that word meno is used over 11 times in that passage
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.760]   and Jesus is telling his disciples as he is going to the cross that where I go you cannot
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:44.200]   come but if you want to bear fruit you need to meno in me the word meno is one of those
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.760]   words that can't be translated with one word so some of your translations it would say
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.780]   remain some of your translation it says to abide some of your translations it says to
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:31:00.840]   dwell some of your translations it says to live but basically that word means to be connected
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.380]   to continue what God has started that's what that word means so if you notice here he says
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:14.180]   let love of the brethren remain to continue in other words the love of Christ has given
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:21.380]   to all genuine believers all genuine believers because that was the greatest evidence of
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:26.380]   separation from the world in first Thessalonians 4 9 through 10 it said now as to love of the
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.740]   brethren you have no need for anyone to write to you for you yourselves are taught by God
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:37.100]   to love one another for if indeed you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in Macedonia
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:41.540]   but we urge you brethren to excel still more in other words the apostle Paul saying I don't
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:46.380]   need to teach you this because God already taught you this now what does he mean by that
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:51.660]   that God audibly open up heaven and say love so when apostle Paul showed up it's like oh
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.540]   I don't need to teach you because you heard that from heaven is that what he means well
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:00.500]   that's not what he means he means that the practice of this love is so fundamental to
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:07.820]   the gospel that as Christ loved us you would naturally love if God was generous to you
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.940]   you would be generous and that's what it means I don't need to teach you because at the root
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:20.380]   of the gospel at the root of redemptive history is God loving sinners it was given to us and
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:26.220]   it was given to us to do by the power of the Holy Spirit in first John 4 19 it says we
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:34.300]   love because he first loved us we love because he first loved us you know one of the first
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:39.580]   things that happens when you begin to stray away from God or begin to drift away from
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:47.620]   God you start to get annoyed with people that's the first thing because this is impossible
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:53.940]   to practice this is impossible to practice in the Old Testament God says eye for an eye
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:59.980]   tooth for tooth right what is eye for an eye tooth for tooth there's different degrees
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:06.260]   of relationships that we practice we practice vengeance justice mercy and grace eye for
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:14.900]   an eye tooth for tooth is what it's not mercy it's not grace it's justice right they took
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.380]   an eye you take an eye right they punch you in the mouth you punch them in the mouth that's
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:26.380]   justice the reason why God even has to tell us to practice justice is because our natural
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:35.620]   inclination isn't to practice justice what is our natural inclination to practice vengeance
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:40.100]   so as much as people are marching and saying no justice no peace they're not looking for
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:48.620]   justice they're not looking for justice they're looking for vengeance you hurt me I want to
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:55.900]   hurt you you punch me I'm gonna punch your family you slash my tire I'm gonna burn your
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:01.220]   car you rob from me I'm gonna take your whole bank account that's our natural in our flesh
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:08.980]   our desire is not to practice justice you have to be a righteous man a self-controlled
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:15.620]   disciplined man to practice justice that somebody hurts you and you only hurt them as much as
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:22.540]   they hurt you that's not our sinful state our sinful state is you hurt me I kill you
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:33.540]   right make sure make sure you never even entertain messing with me that's our tendency so imagine
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:39.980]   if that's our flesh that not only does he tells us to practice justice have self-control
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:46.540]   practice justice to go beyond that practice mercy it's like not take vengeance and not
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:52.420]   even justice just just hold it within yourself how hard is that when somebody deliberately
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:35:00.260]   tries to hurt you and you say yeah whatever right you must be emotionally dead or something
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:06.980]   is you are in so much fear that's not that's not how we think if somebody hurt us we don't
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:15.260]   practice mercy to grace and then go beyond that and then to love them to do what's best
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:24.140]   for them so tell somebody who may may or may not be satisfied with vengeance and then command
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:31.140]   them to practice the love that he could he gave to us while we were yet sinners to love
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:37.180]   them give to them take care of them and he said by that love the world will know you
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:43.940]   are my disciples because that's not something you can do in your flesh and that's why he
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:52.060]   says to remain in this love this love I gave you so the moment we begin to stray from Christ
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:36:02.740]   it is humanly impossible to even imagine to practice this love see God's holiness that
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:08.620]   sets us apart from this world is that love that he called us to that's why he says we
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:12.500]   love because he first loved us and then second Corinthians 5 14 to 15 he says for the love
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:19.020]   of Christ controls us Apostle Paul is talking about himself and his disciples now understand
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:24.700]   the context of why he's saying this do you remember Apostle Paul he was writing and he
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:30.500]   begged the Lord three times to take away the thorn on his side and if you read the commentaries
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:35.100]   people have done a lot of work to try to figure out what is that thorn is that he begged the
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:40.700]   Lord to take it away it was so painful for him some people say that maybe he was sick
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.700]   there's no mention of that anywhere in the Bible so I'm not sure if that's the best interpretation
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:49.100]   because if he was sick that would have been the only problem some jokingly said maybe
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:53.580]   it was his wife his wife just just couldn't stand that he's not making enough money you
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:58.060]   know he's always away from home it's as a joke and I don't think Paul is pretty clear
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:03.820]   he says he's not married but if you read the context of first Corinthians Paul when he
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:10.020]   showed up to the city he was trembling in fear he was getting beat up jailed whooped
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:16.420]   almost died shipwrecked so when he comes into the city he was in fear he was burnt out he
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:21.420]   was tired and he was looked like he was going to quit that's how he described himself and
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:25.940]   the Lord Jesus spoke to him and said I want you to continue your work because I have many
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:32.940]   who follow me in this city so Paul spent a lot of time in this city sharing the gospel
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:37.580]   bringing people to Christ and establishing this church so he had a special affection
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:43.620]   for this church because he spent a lot of time at this church and it is that church
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.940]   that was falling apart so if you've ever studied the New Testament you know the first and second
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:53.140]   Corinthians are its harshest letter to this to these churches because some people were
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.700]   questioning because they didn't like what he had to say that guy's an apostle how can
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:04.700]   he be an apostle I follow Peter I follow Paulus you know who is this guy and he was writing
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:11.140]   letters to change them to correct them they said this guy's letters are weighty but his
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:17.180]   presence is weak you know he writes with such authority but when he comes he's just a tiny
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:26.820]   little guy bald-headed guy according to church tradition I don't know about you but my inclination
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:33.620]   would have been well you got Peter okay then go to Peter Peter's problem you want Peter
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:41.320]   go to Peter Apollos is the better speaker go no sweat off my back I got all these other
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:46.020]   churches I got to attend to if you if you just take off and leave you know no sweat
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:51.500]   off of my back I mean his anguishing letter that he writes first Corinthians second Corinthians
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:56.340]   questioning his apostleship begging them to repent and still them questioning him who
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:03.540]   is this guy I don't like his sermons and so he begged I think him begging the Lord
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:08.860]   because his opposition who are constantly attacking him and he says in Philippians there
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:13.740]   are some people preaching the gospel just to make it harder for him to preach the gospel
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:19.780]   he was not only being attacked by the Judaizers but within the church who hated him when he
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:24.340]   was calling them out I mean he Galatians starts out am I a servant of man or servant of God
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:30.780]   and he was calling out even Apostle Peter and Barnabas his mentors because he was afraid
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:37.340]   that their actions were going to pervert the gospel and so because he was bold in preaching
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:41.940]   the gospel he had opposition even within the church and I believe when he said he begged
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:46.740]   the Lord to take away the thorn he was having a hard time with those who were criticizing
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:57.540]   him it is in that context he writes because it's so tempting to just let it go it's so
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:03.660]   tempting to shake off the dust and say good riddance I'm here risking my life almost died
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:07.780]   so that you can have the gospel and this is the way you're going to treat me good gone
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:18.740]   but he perseveres he agonizes he pleads it is in that context he says for the love of
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:25.780]   Christ controls us it was because of the love of Christ I endure having concluded this that
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:31.140]   one died for all there for all died and he died for all so that they would live they
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:35.260]   they who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who died and rose again on their
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:40.640]   behalf I believe when he was writing this this was his personal testimony I'm persevering
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:46.220]   because I'm no longer living for myself it's not about me it's not about my pain it's not
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:55.060]   about my sacrifice but Christ crucified because the love of Christ was compelling him to endure
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:41:01.940]   and to love fifth and finally love is the ultimate goal it is the fulfillment of this
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:08.060]   holy law Romans 13 8 through 10 says owe nothing to anyone except the love of one another for
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:13.900]   he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law for this you shall not commit adultery
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:18.080]   you shall not murder you should not steal you should not covet and he basically gives
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:22.860]   a brief list of the Ten Commandments and he says all of this is summarized therefore love
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:27.940]   is the fulfillment of the law so if you look at the Ten Commandments first four commandments
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:35.180]   is about loving God should have no worship any other God no graven images not take the
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.340]   Lord's name in vain to keep the Sabbath holy and then the next six is about the relationship
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:43.600]   that we have with one another and he said but the purpose of of holy living to obey
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:49.700]   these commandments is ultimately practice of love he's giving us a description of how
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:55.340]   to love God and how to love one another and that's exactly what he says in Matthew 22
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:59.300]   37 to 40 and he said to him you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart soul
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:04.780]   mind and strength this is the great and foremost commandment the second like it you shall love
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:11.780]   your neighbor as yourself on these two commandments depend the whole law on the prophets so when
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:18.220]   we think of the law we automatically that goes into the context of holiness and when
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:24.500]   we think of mercy we think of God's forgiveness and and his what he did at the cross but here
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:32.740]   he says the commandment the holy commandment the fulfillment of that is love so these are
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:38.420]   not separate things so if you err in love if you err in love you err in the law if you
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:47.140]   err in the law you err in grace you cannot practice one without the other love is the
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:52.880]   fulfillment of the law 1st John 4 16 to 17 we have come to know and have believed the
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.460]   love of God which has for us God is love and the one who abides in love abides in God God
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:03.420]   abides in him by this love is perfected with us what does that even mean there's another
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:08.220]   word that's important in the New Testament the word perfected is teleos and remember
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.740]   the word teleos doesn't mean that you yourself are morally perfect that's not what that word
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:19.180]   means perfected means that whatever was intended for that is finding fulfillment so if a child
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:28.540]   enters into school when is he perfected when he gets perfect grades no when he graduates
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:33.220]   right I mean he's not saying when you get straight A's all the time you never get anything
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:37.740]   wrong then you are perfected that's not this word this word basically means what God had
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:45.660]   intended he's bringing to fulfillment so what does this mean Christ was crucified and he
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:52.520]   gave his love for us and is perfected in us when we are affected and love one another
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:44:00.060]   so his love is perfected in us when it when we begin to reflect that love in the way that
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:12.300]   we live let me let me end with this you know years ago I would go to retreats you know
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:17.100]   and usually four out of five times is usually somebody I know that asked me to come and
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:22.660]   speak and I would speak and a lot of these churches are not doing well and so I would
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:27.340]   come and give a message and one of the most common questions that I was getting at churches
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:34.940]   at retreats was Pastor Peter when is the right time to leave a church this is my friend's
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:40.980]   church right and he's talking about that church and so I would get these questions eventually
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:44.700]   like you know I said well this is this is the most one of the most common questions
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:50.780]   because people are frustrated and so one I can't how am I I'm at my friend's church yeah
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:56.860]   get out of here my friend came to speak so that you guys can benefit and then I said
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.780]   get out of here it's like so I'm thinking so I would give them the you know that what
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:07.340]   you should give right well how much of this is your problem right are you the troublemaker
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:10.300]   what kind of view that you have that do you have a high view of the church where you just
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.260]   going to hop around church to church so I would give him not knowing the context not
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:19.740]   knowing what the problem is I and I'm more concerned about this is I can't I can't tell
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:24.820]   him to leave I don't even want to know what the problem is because even if I wanted to
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:29.700]   tell you to leave I can't because I'm at my friend's church but years would go by now
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:35.140]   would be the most common question that they would ask and I'm just wrestling with this
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:41.020]   and so I'm wrestling with this idea of practicing love love as yourself and I'm just meditating
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:46.220]   thinking about this and it's a thought came to me what's the right way to answer this
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:53.300]   question and I thought how would I answer if my son asked me this question he went to
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:59.420]   college and he's struggling it's not growing there's stuff happening in the church and
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:06.540]   how would I answer this question because for my son I wouldn't be as concerned about what
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:11.460]   they would think of me because I'd be more concerned about him I wouldn't be so concerned
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:18.340]   about my reputation because I would be more concerned about him so I resolved that I'm
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:24.500]   going to be honest and answer you exactly the way I would answer my son and so that's
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:29.300]   the mindset that I have even inside the church if you ask me a question I'm going to answer
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:35.260]   you like I would answer my own son sometimes you may not like it but that's what I actually
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:42.740]   believe I'm not going to dress it up so that you won't hate me you might hate me but that's
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:46.540]   exactly what I would say to my own son so even if we have to discipline somebody at
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:51.940]   church I'd ask my question would I do this to my own son because I have to believe that
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:57.780]   this is what's best for him not because I'm annoyed not because I'm angered or not because
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:02.500]   I'm offended because I would never approach my children that way even if I'm angered I
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:09.500]   would make sure that whatever I say and do is for their own good and so that didn't solve
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:16.820]   all the problems but it made things much more simpler to practice this love that I need
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:23.020]   to practice this love as I would love myself to love my children to love my wife to love
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:32.420]   people that I genuinely love so when a church practices true biblical love accountability
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:36.780]   happens we don't just simply look at that and say oh what are they going to think if
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:43.460]   I say something and then sweep it under the rug you would never do that for your child
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:49.180]   you would speak up you would say something I'm not saying be jerks right we're not saying
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:52.500]   we're going to create an environment and I see everybody is wrong because you wouldn't
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:57.260]   do that with your kids either you wouldn't be so quick to point out every false things
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:06.660]   because you know that's not good for your kids either but true biblical love never separates
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:17.460]   holiness and mercy they go hand in hand so in practice and I know our natural inclination
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:26.060]   is I'd rather I'd rather err on the side of grace right our goal is to not error period
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:31.720]   we want to know who God is we want to know what the gospel is and we want to truly be
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:37.780]   gospel centered not what I want the gospel to be but what the gospel actually is let's
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:48.100]   pray again as our worship team comes let's take some time to reflect if there's any areas
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:55.780]   in our life where we superficially applied love but in reality was indifference where
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.460]   maybe we were overly harsh because we really didn't love we said you know we're going to
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:04.660]   speak the truth in love but it was more truth than love how are we practicing this in our
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:10.220]   lives to ask the Lord to show us search us and know us see if there's any hurtful ways
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:16.700]   in us so that our church would truly be identified by the love of Christ that the world would
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:21.140]   know that we are his disciples so let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:21.460]   us.
