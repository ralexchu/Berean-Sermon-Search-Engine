[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Okay, if you guys can turn your Bibles to Romans chapter 3.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Romans chapter 3. I'm going to be reading from verse 1 through 8.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   We're going to be mainly focused on the first few verses,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   but I want to read the whole section.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Chapters 3, chapter 3, 1 through 8. Okay?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Reading out of the ESV, it says, "Then what advantage has a Jew?"
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   "Or what is the value of circumcision, much in every way?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   By no means. Let God be true, though everyone were a liar, as it is written,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   that you may be justified in your words and prevail when you are judged.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I speak in a human way, by no means. For then how could God judge the world?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   But if through my lie God's truth abounds to His glory,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   why am I still being condemned as a sinner?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And why not do evil that good may come, as some people slanderously charge us with saying,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   'Their condemnation is just.'" Let's pray.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Father, we pray for your blessing over this morning.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   We pray, Lord God, that your authority and what you have ordained through the preaching of your Word,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   that you will bring to fruition this morning.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   We ask, Lord God, that your Word will go forth and will not return until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   What if I told you this morning that everything that you've been doing up to this point is absolutely useless?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   That you coming to this morning to worship God, in the eyes of God, means absolutely nothing.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   That all the offering that you've been giving up to this point, in God's eyes, meant absolutely nothing.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Some of you guys have maybe worked hard to sacrifice.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Maybe even been out to mission. Maybe even lived out in the mission field for a period.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And all the dedications, all the service to the Church, all the years that you've been coming to Church,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   all the Scriptures that you've memorized, all the times that you labored in prayer,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   that what if I told you this morning that all of that was for nothing?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   That when you stand before God, that you're going to be judged like everybody else.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Well, some of you guys may hear that, and obviously I'm speaking hypothetically,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   but some of you guys may hear that, and maybe if you believed what I was saying,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   obviously it would disturb you tremendously.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   The first thing that may happen is some of you guys may say, "Well, who's this guy?"
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Maybe he's teaching false doctrine.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Where did this guy come from?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And maybe you would attack me and nullify me, and if you nullify me, you would nullify what I'm saying.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Or maybe some of you guys listen and say, "You know, I go through the Scripture, and I look at passages,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and I show you where it says all of these things."
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And you may sit there thinking, "Hmm, could that possibly be true?"
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And if it is true, what does that mean for me?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   You mean all this time that I've spent, all the years that I've been laboring in the Church,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   all the money that you've given, all the Sunday football games that you've missed,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   and you may be thinking about all of these things and saying, "All of that was for nothing?"
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Well, if you look at Chapter 3, Paul is trying to answer that very question.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Because for two chapters, until he gets to Chapter 3, he was basically telling that to the Jews.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And to tell the Jews that all the law-keeping, all the sacrifices that you made,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   all the things that you did at the Temple, your circumcision, all the Scripture that you memorized,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   all the time you went to the Temple to pray, that all of that would mean nothing.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   That when you die, you're no better off than the Gentiles, that you thought,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   not only in your life, but your parents' life, but your grandparents' life, for generations to come,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   you thought that because you were a Jew, that when you died, you were going to have a special place in the Kingdom.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   But Jesus says, or Paul is saying in the Book of Romans,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   is that those who have the law will be condemned by the law.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Those who don't have the law will be condemned without the law.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   But all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   There's not a single person that dies who's going to stand before God and say,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   "You know what? Because I've been circumcised, because I was raised in a Jewish home,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   and every single year we were really faithful with the Passover meal,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   and we did all of that for generations to come."
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Then Paul to come up and all of a sudden saying, "You know, the way of life is Christ,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   and all of that absolutely means nothing."
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   You can imagine what kind of response you would have gotten.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   They wouldn't have just laid over and said, "Oh, okay, that's great. What else you got?"
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You could imagine the kind of response that they would get.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   "Who are you?"
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And so Paul, knowing that this is probably what they're thinking,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   after he lays the foundation that all have sinned.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   In fact, the next part that we're going to get to in verse 9, where he clearly spells out,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   "Whether you are a Jew or Gentile, all have sinned.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   There's not one who seeks God, not one righteous, no one understands. Nobody."
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   So he's been laying the foundation of that, so knowing the response that they would get,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   that they would have. You mean all of this was for nothing?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Then what is the advantage of being a Jew?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And that's a rightful question because all through the Old Testament,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   if you were raised a Jew, you were taught that you were God's chosen people.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I could give you a sample verse, but I could repeat this verse from almost every text in the Old Testament.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   In Deuteronomy 14.2, "For you are a people holy to the Lord your God,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   and the Lord has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth."
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   So again, I'm only giving you one verse, but I can find a verse like that,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   that explains about special position that Israel had,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   that special heart that Israel, God had for his people.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Out of all the nations, I have chosen you, and I have treasured you as my personal possession.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And then for Paul to come out and say, "You know what the Gospel says,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   that all of that means nothing."
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   You are guilty as a Gentile, and you are guilty as a Jew.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Whether you are circumcised or uncircumcised,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   that we are all deserving of condemnation.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Then again, what advantage is there, Jew? In fact, in verses,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   chapter 3, verse 1 through 8, he has eight separate questions.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I'm not going to go through question by question, because some of these questions overlap.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I was trying to deal with two questions this morning, but I didn't get past the first one,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   this first service, so I'm probably going to end up stopping at one.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Unless I forget a big chunk and then I just skip over it.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   But the first and the most important question is, like we would have,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   then all of this, right?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   All of this, all of the going to church, all the
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   church membership, and all the effort to go
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   do mission work, all the sacrifices that we make in giving offering.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   What is all of that? What was the advantage of being a Jew?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And so that is the question that he is trying to answer in the beginning.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And it is a relevant question. It is not only for the Jew.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   It is basically, this is the same question that every Christian
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   who has been raised in the church, or maybe been in church for a while, and you've
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   labored hard to build the kingdom of God,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   every Christian ought to be asking the same question. What is the benefit
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   of all of this? What is the benefit of church?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   What is the benefit of fellowship? What is the benefit of having a building to worship God?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   What is the benefit of being in a covenant community?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And communion, baptism?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Well, he says this. He doesn't waste any time. He asks the question,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   what advantage is there for a Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Much in every way. Much in every way. To begin with,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   and he is going to go, you have the oracles of God. If you turn your
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Bibles with me to Romans chapter 9, 4-5. In fact,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   if you've ever studied the book of Romans before, you'll know that Romans
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   chapter 9, 10, and 11, three chapters are dedicated
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   really to answer that question. Because Paul is going to come
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   down hard on the Jewish community. If there is any
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   thought or any inclination that somehow you are going to make it
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   because you were born into the right family, because you've been
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   doing the right rituals, that if there is any misconception
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   that you stand right before God because of your heritage
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   or your circumcision, Paul basically spends
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   eight chapters destroying that. So the question that
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   obviously they would ask is the same question he asks here, but again he deals
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   with it more extensively. Chapter 9, 10, and 11.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Is God done with Israel? Is that it?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Well he goes into a little bit more detail in Romans chapter 9, 4-5.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   He says, here is the advantage of being a Jew. They are Israelites, and to them
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   belong the adoption. In other words,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   you are not just like everybody else. You are not just a creation of God.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   God chose you to be His own possession, to be His own children.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   The glory. There is no other nation that was able
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   to see the glory of God like the nation of Israel.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   You know the scripture says that God revealed Himself to the whole world, but to the nation of Israel
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   His glory was evident.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   It was in the temple, even in the 40 years while they are being judged, the glory
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   of God was with them the whole time. He said to them,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   you are the glory. You have the covenants. God may have made a general
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   covenant with the world, but with the nation of Israel. In Genesis
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   chapter 15, God makes a unilateral covenant
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   with the nation of Israel saying, you will be My people and I will be your God.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   To them, they had the giving of the law, the worship,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   all the promises. To them belong the patriarchs.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   From their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ who is God over all.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Blessed forever, amen. In other words, Christ Himself was a Jew.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   How can you possibly ask what benefit
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   is there? Well, I mean, we can relate to that, right?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   If He just came out and just destroyed everything that you've been up to this point, He said all of that was for useless.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   I mean, those of you who may have just joined the church and say, oh, okay, I'm glad
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I didn't spend any time here. You know, I'm glad I found this out early
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   before I put in any more time. But those of you who've been here longer,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   who's been walking with the Lord longer, it's going to disturb you even more.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   But He says much in every way. And He says,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   He goes on and says, to begin with, the Jews were
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   entrusted with the oracles of God. NIV actually says
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   firstly, right? But the strange thing is, He says
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   to begin with, and then He never goes anywhere else. Right?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   He says firstly, and then He never gets to the second, third point.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   You know, it's the greatest blessing that you have, greatest advantage that you have, is you have the
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   word of God. And then He never goes into the second or third.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Well, the reason why He does that is, we need to properly understand, when He
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   says, to begin with, He's not saying, I'm going to begin with this, and then I'm going to
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   lead you to some other stuff. The word He uses here is
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   proton, or protos, where we get the word priority. And that's
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   the same word that's used in Revelation chapter 2, where Jesus speaks
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   to the Church of Ephesus and says, "You have forsaken your first love."
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Protos agapem. And the word protos basically doesn't
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   mean first, second, third, fourth, or fifth. Meaning you've forsaken your first
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   love because now you are in your fourth love, and I need you to work back up to your first
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   love. The word proton basically means above everything
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   it is the most important. It is priority.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   So again, when that word is used in Revelation it is referring to
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   that your love for Christ has cooled. That He is not the
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   most important thing in your life. He may be important. He may be something.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   But He is not most important. That's the same
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   word that is used here to describe the advantage
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   of being a Jew. The primary
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   advantage, think about all the advantages that you can think of as a Jew. We think of
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   it would have been awesome to be a part of that camp for 40
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   years. We actually saw the presence
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   of God in the clouds. He gave specific instructions
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   where the glory of God you could visually see. Wouldn't it have been awesome
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   if you escaped from Egypt and you were walking in the middle of the Red
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Sea. And you look at it, and I don't know about you, but
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   if I was walking through the split river, the Red Sea, I would have
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   wanted it. I would have splashed myself the whole way through. You know what I mean? Just enjoying
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   this. Look at this. Think about all the advantage of being a Jew.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Right? Think about all the miracles that they
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   saw. The encounter that Elijah had with the
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Baal priests. Right? The miraculous food that they ate.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   The manna. I mean I can think of tons of
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   things. Well look at the advantage that you guys had. All of this. But He says above everything
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   that I can mention are the advantages. Your primary advantage
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   is that you have the oracles of God.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   You know when we think about the advantage that we have as Americans
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   living in this generation, and we travel the world,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   physically speaking, humanly speaking, our advantage is absolutely crystal clear.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Anybody who feels like, "Oh your life is hard,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   and you don't make enough money." Travel a little bit. But don't
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   travel to nice places. Travel to real
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   places. Right? 95% of the world, when you go
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   and travel, you're going to realize how filthy rich you are. You got 20 bucks in your pocket.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   That's more than what 95% of the world has. Right?
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   And so when you go, you're going to come back and think, "Man, we are privileged."
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Right? And it's not just money. The freedom that you have.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   The fact that you can just turn in your passport and they stamp it and you can just go pretty much anywhere in the world.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   The majority of the people in the world can't do that.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Some of you guys were going to India with us this winter.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   There's 35 pastors, and we're going to probably run into maybe about a thousand
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   people. Not one of them, not one
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   of them have ever been on an airplane. Ever.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   In fact, the pastor that we have contact with, the furthest he's ever been is Bangalore, which is
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   about a five hour distance. Beyond that, he's never been anywhere else.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   The majority of the people that we meet there have never been outside their village.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   They don't know what the rest of the world is like. So the fact that you and I can
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   travel. What we're doing right here.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   The majority of the people, there's a lot of people in the world that just can't even gather like this.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   They can't. Without risking their lives.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   So you can think of all kinds of advantages that you and I have.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   But the primary advantage,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   the primary advantage is what Paul is saying to the Jews, what God is saying to
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   the nation of Israel. The primary benefit of being a
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   chosen people of God was that they had the Word of God.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   And that's the primary advantage that you and I have.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   That we live in a generation where the access to the Word of God
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   is more prevalent than any other time in human history. Ever.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Ever.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Today we fight for which translation
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   of the Bible we should use. So we have the ESV people, we have the
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   NASB people, we have the NIV people, we have the King James people.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   It's like, "Nah, we're fighting for the right to have the right translation."
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Esther and I, our
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   first home that we ever bought, we bought in La Mirada. And I shared this with you guys before.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   We bought it because I would spend at least two to three days in the library preparing
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   for Bible studies and sermons. And this is before internet. So I had to go to the library,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   find a big table at Biola, and then I had to get all the
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   reference books and lay it out. And I've got to claim it early in the morning so that the other
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   the tablet students don't get the books first. I've got to go there
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   and be selfish and sit at all the tables and claim it all for me. And I
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   need more than a little space because I've got all these books and spread it out. And so
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   if I'm studying I don't understand this. I've got to go find this reference book, go
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   look up the decimal system, John Dewey decimal system, go look it up
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   and then get that, get all these books. So it would take half a day
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   to sit there and just go through one passage. And so
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   with that, "Hey, you know, go to La Mirada." Then I could just drive to school and back and it would only be
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   a couple minute drive. And then, you know, soon after that the PC study Bible
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   came out. And then the internet came out. And then
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   after a while I didn't need to go to the library anymore. Right? But that's the privilege that we
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   have. We can have a question and all of a sudden you just ask a question and it pops up now.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Right? I don't have to go anywhere. I can sit and I can have a question sitting in the
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   middle of the park, nowhere, and I can just say, "Hey, what is this?" And then it'll pop
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   up. Right? No other generation ever has had the kind of
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   access to the Word of God that you and I have today.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Our primary privilege is not money. Our
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   primary privilege is not even our freedom.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   It's safety, that we have American citizenship.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   According to what the Word of God is saying, the
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   primary privilege of the nation of Israel and God's people
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   is that they had the oracles of God, first and foremost.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Right? And the reason why this was the tremendous blessing for them
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   is because, remember Paul said in chapter 1 that
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   all the nations, the Gentiles, they were given the
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   imprint of God in nature, in His creation, so that no
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   one is without excuse. Anybody can look at the creation of God and say, "God must be powerful.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   There must be a being." And there was enough to lead them
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   to Christ. But to the nation of Israel, the Scripture says
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   that God gave them a lamp
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   that they can clearly see. In fact, Paul says in 2 Timothy
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   3.14 to Timothy, "To continue what you have learned
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you have learned it, and how from
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings." The sacred writings he is
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   talking about is the Old Testament. "How you have been acquainted
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   with the Old Testament, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   in Christ Jesus." In other words he says, "You've been given the oracles of God
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   so that that would lead you to Christ." He says, "So pay very
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   close attention to it." So,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   it's kind of to illustrate that all
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   the rest of the world has been given sparklers, basically.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   And that sparkler is good enough. If you desired to find God,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   that sparkler will light the path enough to get you to God.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   But you, the nation of Israel, you were given a lamp.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   And that lamp was to be used and it was clear. The path
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   to Christ was clear. But instead of using it as a
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   lamp to a path to Christ, what they did was they used it as a
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   spotlight. And used that lamp to spotlight themselves. "Look what I
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   did. Look what I have." And instead of
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   pointing them to Christ, which will lead to life, all they did was become self-righteous.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   But he says the primary gift
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   was his presence through his
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   word. When Esther, my
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   wife, used to be a school teacher, third grade teacher. She used to
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   have this system where if the kids did great in school, or behaved well, she would pass out
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   rewards. And the reward was that once, I think
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   once every two weeks or once a month, the star student would be able to have
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   lunch with a teacher. And so there was a Carl's
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Jr. next door and she would say, "Oh, you did great in school."
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Or, "You had great behavior." And she said, "Well,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   then that kid gets to have lunch with a teacher." And you know, it's just to
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   me, I was like, "That's the prize?"
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   You know?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   I can't remember a single time in my life where I thought spending time with a
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   teacher was a prize. But the kids would
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   work hard to spend time with them. In fact, if you were really good, if you were
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   really good, and you were beyond good, then you get to spend
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   time with the principal. The principal.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   The principal would take you out to lunch. And again, those of you guys
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   who know my testimony, I mean, I never did I ever think
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   spending time with the principal was a good thing. Right?
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   I've never received a notice from the principal and it was good news. Never.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   But again, these kids are better kids than I
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   was, obviously. And the reason why it was a reward is because
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   the teacher, who's a significant figure in the classroom, that they are able to have a
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   personal relationship with them. They're sitting down with them and talking to them and the
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   principal of the school, they get to draw near. So they were special.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   That they didn't just sit in the classroom. That they were taken out of the classroom
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   and actually sat with a teacher. It was a big deal for them.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   So in the same way, what Paul is saying, you are the children
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   of God. God particularly chose you to draw near to you.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And so that you can draw near to Him.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   That was the primary gift that He gave to the Jews. But instead of using that
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   to come to God, they became self-righteous and used it as a spotlight
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   to say, "Hey, look at me."
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   They were privileged, but they completely
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   missed God. That's the primary
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   tragedy of the nation of Israel. How they could have had
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   so much revelation about who Jesus is. Think about
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   the sacrifices. Think about the temple. All of that to teach them
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   that you cannot draw near to a holy God by your own merit.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Think about the cities of refuge. Think about
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   all the laws. Think about the sacrifice, the Day of Atonement. All of that.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   The Passover meal. All of that is embedded into their
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   culture. You know, one of the benefits of being a US
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   citizen, we live in a post-Christian culture, but we have Christian things all
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   over in the things that we practice. We have it in Christmas, we have Easter,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Thanksgiving. And it's not hard to share the Gospel, teaching English
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   around the world, because all we have to say is, "We are going to learn American culture, and we are going
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   to teach you what Christmas is about. And then we'll teach them about Christmas, and then we share
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   the Gospel. Well, next day we are going to talk about Easter. Well, what is Easter about?
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   It's about the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, and we share the Gospel. Talk about Thanksgiving.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   These are major holidays in our culture. And even though they are trying
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   to minimize it, and kind of take Christ out of all of these things, the benefit
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   is that it's embedded in our culture. It's in our, the language is in our Constitution.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   It's in the money that we carry.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   But think about the Jewish culture. Every part of
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   everything that they did was to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Everything. Their festivals, their meals.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   When they went to the Temple, the sacrifices.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   And this was from generation to generation to generation to generation.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   And then to have the Christ that the Scripture
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   talked about for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   And then to completely miss Him. Now we would all
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   agree that that's a great tragedy.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And we need to be careful that we recognize
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   the same temptation, the same problem that you and I
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   have. That we have such saturation
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   with the Word of God. And yet so few
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   people who really understand what the Word of God is.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   You and I live in a generation where any kind of question that we have, any
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   theological question that we have, we can instantaneously look it up
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   on the Internet. And yet so few people with deep
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   affection for Christ. See in the book of Amos,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   chapter 8, 11-12, God sends this prophet Amos saying that
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   because you disobeyed and you worshipped idols, God's going to bring judgment.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And at the end of the book of Amos, He says the final judgment
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   that's going to come to the nation of Israel is described this way.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Amos 8, 11-12, "Behold the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will send
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   a famine on the land. Not a famine of bread, nor a
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   They shall wander from sea to sea and from north to east.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   They shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, but they shall
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   not find it." He said when
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   the people continue to ignore God over and over again, He says He's
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   going to withdraw Himself. And the way He's going to withdraw Himself, He's going to bring a famine
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   of the Word of God. Do you
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   see what I see in our generation? Do you see,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   and I believe most of you, if not all of you, to some extent
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   will agree with me. Today we have millions
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   and millions of people attending church.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   But where the Word of God is exalted and taught
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   is hard to find.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   He said there's going to be a famine of the Word of God. Now famine comes in two ways.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   One, famine comes because you can't find it.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And there was a period in Israel's history where they neglected the Word of God so much
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   that when Josiah comes into power and he becomes a king, he has to
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   go look for it in the Temple. And a revival breaks out because they found
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   the Bible. They found the Torah. In other words
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   this whole nation that was built upon the foundation of His command
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   that they didn't read it for generations. They didn't know
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   where it was. And they go and they find it and then they read it for
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   the first time in hundreds of years and all of a sudden revival breaks out.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   So famine of the Word of God can come in one
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   way where you just don't hear it. You look for it and you can't find it. But there's
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   another kind of famine that comes. And I think the best way to describe it is someone
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   dying of thirst in the middle of an ocean.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Where you can be saturated with the Word of God. But you're
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   so sick you can't eat. You're dying of hunger
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   and there's a buffet everywhere around you but you can't eat because
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   you're so sick. You don't have the appetite.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   You can smell the food but it's not attractive. You smell
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   and you know that you ought to eat this but you can't because you don't have
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   the appetite. And there's a famine that comes
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   again I think you and I are part of the second issue
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   problem. No other generation. I mean think about the Word of God.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Think about how this came to us. There was a
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   period in church history where the church denied the Word of God to the people.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Said don't worry about what it says just trust what we say. And a
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   few corrupt men refused to give the Word of God to people.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   So people actually gave their lives translating this
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   into German, into English, into French
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   so that we can have the Word of God. This didn't
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   just come down to us. There was a period when the Word of
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   God again even in church history was so neglected. You and I
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   are part of the Protestant church. We are Protestants because
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   we protested that the church was not teaching the Word
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   of God. And so therefore people gave their lives
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   so that we can come out and have this Word.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Our primary advantage in our generation what we have
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   is that we have free access to His living Word.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   And yet Israel with all the sacrifices
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   with all the temple worship completely missed Christ.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   In Hosea chapter 4 verse 6 God says to the nation of Israel
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   He's not talking about lack of theology. He's not talking about lack of
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   understanding of right understanding of theology. He's talking about knowledge
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   of God. They perish because
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   they do not know Him. Because you have rejected knowledge. I reject you from being
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God I also will forget
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   your children. The way that we talk about
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   knowing God sometimes it's like we know. Like I know a lot about Barack Obama.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   He's the President of the United States. I know his name, where he was born,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   his wife, his children. I know his background. I know
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   about his ancestors. I know his hobby. I know a lot about him.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   And that's the way a lot of people talk about Christ.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   I know about Jesus. I know where he came from. I know
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   who his father is. I know who his disciples are. I know what he
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   did 2,000 years ago. I know he's the object of our
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   worship. We know him, about him. But do you know
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   him? Do you know this Jesus?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Do you have a personal relationship with this Jesus?
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   You and I recognize you can come to church all your
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   life, week after week, month after month, give
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   tithe after tithe, and then come to the same point that the Jews
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   were at in chapter 3.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   All of this was for nothing. All of this could be
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   for nothing. All the serving in the church, all the relationships
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   that you built, all the football games that you missed,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   could easily be for nothing
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   if it doesn't bring you to Christ.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   And I'm not talking about a superficial adherence, it's like, "Oh, you know,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   one saved, always saved. You know, I made a confession. I went down the altar call."
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   I'm not talking about something superficial because you did some external ritual.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   I'm talking about a regeneration of your heart.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   A awakening of your eyes to see the glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Where Christ becomes so precious. There's nothing in this life
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   more precious in light of the knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   The surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ where everything else becomes
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   rubbish. You can come to church all your life and
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   completely miss it. And even though we have this advantage,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   we have even a greater advantage than the Jews. Because the
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Jews had the shadow of the reality. We had the reality in
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Christ. He was given to us in clarity.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   He was the exact imprint of God.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Everything about Him was the exact imprint of who God
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   was. And we have that picture of Christ.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   And yet, to come to church week after week,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   month after month, and do all that we do, and to benefit
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   from all the superficial things that come along in being a part of a
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Christian community, and then to miss Christ.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   It was tragic.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   You know, George Varna did a survey of the literacy of
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Biblical literacy in the country. The majority of the people in the United States,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   over 80% of the people in the United States, say that they own a Bible
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   and they have very high regards of the Bible. Now there's different degrees of
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   that obviously. There are some people who believe in inerrancy, some people who don't believe in it.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   But what the world believes, what the
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   superficial, nominal Christians believe is irrelevant.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   But he has another survey that talks about Evangelical Christians, people who
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   claim to be born again. And so he did a survey to see
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   how much people knew about the Scripture. He says,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   this is his finding, he says, "Fewer than half the adults can name
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   the four Gospels in the New Testament." I know some of you guys are already
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   thinking, like, "I can't remember how to name four Gospels. I can name
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   four Gospels, no problem. I passed that test." "60% of
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Americans can't name five of the Ten Commandments." Some of you guys are getting nervous
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   already. I can name six, I'm not sure.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   "60% of Americans can't name five of the Ten Commandments."
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   "81% of these people believe that God helps those who help themselves."
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Some of you are like, "That's not in the Bible."
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   No, that's not in the Bible. It said 81%. Don't know that.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   "12% believe that Joan of Arc was Noah's wife."
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Okay. So some of you just got educated.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   Alright? He's not. Okay. I'm pretty sure
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   that most of you know that these answers, you can answer
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   them correctly. "50% of high school seniors believe that Sodom and Gomorrah
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   were husband and wife." Okay. Everybody's smiling in here.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   You already know the answer. Those of you guys looking at me like, "What the...?"
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Alright. You're busted. Lastly, "Large portion
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   thought that the Sermon on the Mount was preached by Billy Graham."
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Now, I've given you some basic
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   stuff. You've probably listened to that. If you've been a Christian and attending church, a Bible
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   teaching church for a while, it's just kind of like, "Well, of course we know that. We're Bible
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   literate." But let me get a little bit more personal.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Let me get a little bit more personal.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And maybe disturb you guys a little bit. Okay?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   And don't say anything. I just want you to sit there and think about
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   this. How many of you can defend the doctrine of
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Trinity with a Jehovah Witness? Don't raise your hand. Don't say anything.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   I want you to think about it. How many of you can go
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   through the Scripture? Not bring them to me. Not give them literature.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   But how many of you can defend the doctrine of Trinity to a Jehovah Witness?
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Okay? And if you
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   cannot, my next question is, "How long have you been
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   a Christian? How long have you
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   confessed Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?" Is the doctrine of
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Trinity important? Absolutely. Absolutely.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   If you don't know the doctrine of Trinity and you get that wrong,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   you may not be a Christian. So, to not
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   be able to go to the Scripture and say, "This is why I believe
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   that Jesus Christ is not a God, but the God. And here is what the Scripture
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   says about it." So, the question is,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   how can we be so saturated with all
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   the access that we have to the Word of God
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   and have so little interest in the fundamental
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   doctrines of our faith that we confess?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Let me disturb you further. Can you defend
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   the doctrine of justification by faith from the Bible?
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   They say, "Oh, now he's getting theological. That's for pastors.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   These are theological. These legalists."
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   The doctrine of justification by faith is the Gospel. That's the
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Gospel. We can just call it the Gospel. We can just say justification by faith, but it means
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   the same thing. Can you defend the doctrine of justification
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   by faith? Can you sit down with a Roman Catholic and have a
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   discussion with them about why salvation is by faith and by
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   faith alone? Why am I
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   asking you these questions? Because we
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   have the Word of God. We confess that life is
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   from here. We confess that this is the truth.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   And to have it and say, "You know, we bought it. We put it here and then we
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   go to the right church." And a lot of us, that's enough.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   It's enough that we attend the right church. It's enough that we have a church
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   where we have the right doctrine, a seemingly right doctrine. That's enough.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   But does this bring you to Christ?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Why is it not important enough to
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   search? Is homosexuality
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   clearly declared to be sin in Scripture? We're being challenged
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   and pulled left and right in our generation. And we have more and more
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   people saying that, "No, that's not what the Bible teaches." And so
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   few people in the church can actually open up the Scripture and say, "This is what the Scripture says."
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   And this is why churches, one after another,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   are falling. Because we have access to the
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Word of God, but so few people know what it says.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   So we say, "Oh, thank God we have a pastor who can defend the faith." And that's
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   we just kind of defer. That's it. As long as they know, it doesn't matter if I know.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Can a Christian lose his salvation? I know
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   you've been at the church long enough. The knee-jerk reaction is, "No."
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   You can't lose your salvation. Why? Where did you get
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   that? What's that based on? What Scripture gives you
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   that confidence? How did we even get
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   this Bible? I mean if you go out and share the Gospel with anybody, that's one of the first things that you
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   run into. Well that was just written by man.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   And it was given to us at the church, the Council of Carthage, 386 A.D.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   So how do you know? This is just written by man. So the doctrines
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   of the Buddhists and the Muslims, they were given by man. So how can you say that
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   this is the Word of God?
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   My point is not here to defend all of this. I'm asking you, how long have you been
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   a Christian and still don't know these fundamental things about
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   the Word of God? Why do we know more
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   about Kobe's shooting percentage?
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   You know, where they stand and
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   what kind of lottery draft they're going to have, than in the things that we
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   profess gives life. This is about
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   life and death and we know very little about it, other than we go to church.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   We happen to go to the right church. So when
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Hosea says, "My people are judged because they lack knowledge."
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   If we're not careful, you and I
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   can be guilty of the same thing. Is our confidence,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   is the confidence that we have, is it coming from the Living Word
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   of God? Is it coming from your personal relationship with
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Jesus Christ? Or is the confidence that you are at the right
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   church? That you happen to be in a church that has
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   a right doctrinal statement, or you just assume it's the right doctrinal statement?
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   It's because you've been doing the right things. You've been going to the right church and you've been raised in the right family.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Where is your confidence?
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Is it in God or is it in man?
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Is Jesus really the only way?
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Some of you guys who've ever tried to share the Gospel, that's probably something that you've been
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   thrown at your face. Right? As long as you're
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   in your Christian bubble and you spend all your life reaffirming each other,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   "Hey, you know, we're saved. God loves you. It's the grace of God.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   God loves you. He died for you. Grace of God." And all we're doing in this little Christian bubble
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   is reaffirming each other's faith.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   "Yeah, it's true. This is right." And that's what fellowship is. Fellowship is a bunch of Christians
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   getting together, reaffirming any kind of insecurities that we may have
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   of life. And so I affirm you, you affirm me, and that's what we look for
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   in a church. A church that affirms one another. But when you step out of this
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   bubble and you begin to get challenged,
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   how dare you? You are telling me
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   billions of people, not just in this generation, previous
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   generation, and the generations to come, that all of them will be
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   condemned? How arrogant are you to
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   say such a thing? How are you different than the terrorists?
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   And so in fear, because we're afraid, and
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   because we never thought about it and looked into it deep enough, that's enough to shake us
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   so what we do is we keep our mouths shut.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Instead of looking into it, what does the Scripture say? How do I defend the faith and strengthening
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   our faith? What we do is we kind of get in our little bubble
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   and any kind of insecurities we have, we just kind of, "No, you're okay, don't worry
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   about it, you're okay." And we never grow. We never mature.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   We're never challenged.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   The primary benefit that you and I have is His Word.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   It's His Word. So let me ask you
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   this morning, let me disturb your peace this morning.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   Where does this Word stand in your life? And I'm not talking theologically, I'm not talking about on paper.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   I'm talking about on your daily life with God. Do you truly
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   believe that this is life? Do you truly
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   believe that? And if you do, what does this life look like
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   in your life? Not today, this morning. I'm not talking about this morning. Because I'm doing
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   all the work. Right? I'm doing all the work.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   I'm talking about when you go home. Where does this stand in you?
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   Because of all the benefits
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   that the nation of Israel had,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   He says, "In much and every way, and first and
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   foremost, above everything that God has given you, you've been entrusted
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   with the oracles of God."
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Our primary blessing that you and I have is that we have
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   access to the Word of God like no other generation.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   You're able to know God, His thoughts, His plan
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   like no other generation. Not only is it in your language, it's in the palm
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   of your hands. Every thought, question
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   that you have, you don't need to ask a pastor. You don't need to go to a seminary. You can just ask.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   And it pops up. We should be more
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   equipped, more ready, more
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   challenged to do every good work than any
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   other generation that has ever existed. Right?
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   The Word of God is living and active. Right?
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   It's useful for training, for correcting. Right?
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   That man or God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. So you and I should be more
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   equipped than any other generation that have ever existed before us.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   I want to conclude with this challenge.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Because it is serious. Right? It's not just about this
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   morning. This is serious. The thing
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   that I have that disturbs me more than anything else.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   And it disturbed me when I was a young Christian. It disturbs me to this day.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   That at the end, Jesus said, "Many will come to Me
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   and say, 'Lord, Lord.'" He said, "But I never knew
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   you. I never knew you. All
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   that you have done had nothing to do with Me." It was about you.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   It wasn't about finding life in Christ. It wasn't
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   about the Gospel. It was about you.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   It was about peace in your life. It was about living a
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   better life, a better marriage, a better future, a better hope.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   But it wasn't about Christ.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   The tragedy of the Jews that Paul was trying to get
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   through. And why he spent so much time saying the same thing
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   over and over and over and over and over again is until their peace is
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   disturbed, until their life is, it crumbles
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   in the presence of the Gospel, Jesus
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   will not be their life. Until you
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   and I recognize that all that we have built and all that we are
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   building outside of Christ is rubbish. Christ will
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   not mean anything. So I pray with all of my heart that this
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   tragedy would not be what you and I experience.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   That every person in this room would come to a saving knowledge of Jesus
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   Christ. And I'm not just talking about come to church every week, become a member
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   and give and participate. I'm talking about knowing Christ.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   That every single person in this room would come to a saving knowledge of
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Jesus Christ. If you can take a minute to pray with me as I
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   ask the praise team to come up. And as they prepare, I'm going to ask you
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   to take a minute to pray.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   And I'm not going to assume that in this room that all of you guys are born again
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   Christians. I'm not going to assume that
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   you know what the Word of God says. My question is
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   where is your confidence? Is it something that
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   your pastor said? Is it from the church that you grew up in? Or just your paradigm
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   of how you determine what is right and wrong? Or did the Word of God convict you?
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   Do you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ?
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   And to look hard and
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   deeply. And if you do, pray for the people around you.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   The greatest tragedy would be to be in a church
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   where the Word of God is taught and then to completely miss Christ.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   So if you have confidence
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   in Christ, then pray for the people around you. That we do not simply look at the
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   church and say, "Hey, thank God we're at a church and we have the right
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   doctrine." Because the people next to you may not be Christians. So pray
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   and labor. As the harvest is
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   plentiful and the workers are few, that God would raise more laborers for His Kingdom.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   So let's take a few minutes to pray before God and ask the Lord to
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   convict us, strengthen us, that the church that we are building is a
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   true church that will worship God in spirit and in truth. So let's take some time...
