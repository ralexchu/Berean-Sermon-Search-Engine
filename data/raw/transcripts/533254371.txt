[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   Thank you, Brian, and congratulations on your baptism.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.800]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to 1 Corinthians 15, 14, and then we'll be reading
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.600]   verse 17 and 19.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.000]   Okay.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   1 Corinthians chapter 14, 15, verse 14, and then verse 17 through 19.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.960]   I'm reading out of the NASB, verse 14.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.200]   And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.720]   Your faith is also in vain.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.860]   Verse 17 through 19.
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.560]   And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.440]   You are still in your sins.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.880]   Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.640]   If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most to be pitied.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.600]   Let's pray.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.640]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your continued guidance.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.360]   May your words speak to us.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.800]   May your word and only your word go forth.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.880]   Soften our hearts, open our eyes.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.680]   Allow us to hear, Father God, that we may be convicted and to be molded according to
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.880]   your purpose and will.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.880]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.880]   Amen.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.360]   You know, a few weeks back, and I'm sure many of you had conversations with unbelievers
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.680]   similar to mine.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.880]   We were, my wife and I, we were in Costco.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.880]   And typically, I think some of you men are like me, you know, I just kind of guard the
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.000]   cart and then while my wife goes and gets the stuff.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.800]   And so I usually find a nice place to either sit or find the electronics area and I just
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.000]   kind of hang out in the area and she'll get the stuff.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   So, you know, typically I was there with the cart and then my wife was running around getting
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.400]   all this stuff and then I could see the corner of my eye, there was this guy who was trying
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.840]   to make eye contact with me.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.480]   And he was a solar panel salesman, right, at Costco.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.160]   And he was trying to, I think, subtly get my attention, right.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.920]   But people tell me that I don't have a very pleasant resting face, meaning that if I'm
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.720]   not smiling, they think I'm angry.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.400]   So I could tell he was kind of a little bit hesitant to come to me.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   So I said, "Oh, it's a good opportunity.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.600]   I don't know when my wife's going to come back."
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.840]   So I just kind of rolled up to him and I started a conversation hoping that I can maybe share
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.040]   the gospel.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.320]   And so, you know, he's trying to sell me the solar panels and I'm trying to sell him Jesus.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.000]   And so we were just kind of having a friendly conversation and found out that he used to
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.320]   attend church and he fell out.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.600]   So I asked him, you know, "So what caused you to fall?"
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.840]   And then he started to kind of name the reasons why he said, "Well, you know, the Bible was
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.760]   written by man and, you know, all this stuff was made up by people and we didn't even have
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.160]   the Bible until 500 years later."
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.680]   And so I have no idea where he picked up this information, but everything he said was wrong,
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.680]   you know.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.680]   And so those are very typical liberals, you know, talking points that they pick up either
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.540]   at a secular university or some book that they read.
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.480]   And I started sharing with him, I said, "That's not true at all.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.680]   You know, we actually have manuscript from the very first century.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.960]   The Bible was there from the beginning.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.120]   We have records of it being passed down from generation to generation.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.180]   It wasn't until the Council of Carthage at 387 that they decided to put the books together,
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.640]   but it wasn't made up at that time."
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.600]   So I just sharing this and, you know, he was like, "Oh, okay."
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.360]   And typically, usually when we get to this part of the conversation, they'd be, "I don't
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.760]   want to talk to you," but he was trying to sell me the solar panel.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.800]   So he was trying to be courteous, right?
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.240]   And then so I asked him, "So then if that's not the reason, then what is it?
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.280]   I mean, is it you just don't believe in it?"
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280]   He said, "Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.240]   In the end, it's hard for me to believe, you know."
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.040]   But again, like I said, he's trying to be courteous, and so he didn't want me to leave.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.520]   Obviously, I had no intention of leaving, but he didn't want me to leave.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.240]   He said, "Yeah, yeah, but, you know, even though I don't believe in all that stuff,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.480]   you know, I think he's a great guy.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.840]   I think Jesus is a great man, taught great morals, and, you know, for the most part,
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.840]   he's a great guy."
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.000]   And again, he was trying to keep me to stay so he can sell me the solar panels, you know.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.880]   And then, you know, my response to him, they said, "Well, how can he be a great man if
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.280]   he said he was God?
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.360]   You know, I understand that he may have done some good things and feed poor people, but
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.840]   in the end, he said he was God and then claimed that he was going to die and resurrect on
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.840]   the third day.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.320]   So either he's a crazy man, and in the last 2,000 years, he's deceived millions of people.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.600]   Think about how many people who forsook their lives and walked into difficult places.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.040]   Think about how many people who lives in Muslim countries who are risking their lives to gather
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.440]   together to praise his name.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.280]   Think about how many people who have forfeited everything in their life to proclaim this
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.280]   truth.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.240]   So either he's a liar who's caused more damage than any human being alive, or he really
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.720]   is who he says he is, and there really isn't anything in between, right?
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.800]   And like I said, usually when I get to this point, they would get upset, and then they
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.640]   would say, "I don't want to talk to him," and they would leave, but he wanted to sell
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.640]   the solar panels.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.480]   So I sat there, listened, I gave him an opportunity to present, and I'm actually supposed to speak
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:20.280]   to him in two more weeks about these solar panels, right?
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.080]   But the point of the conversation was, I'm sure you guys have had opportunities to talk
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.000]   to people who maybe said the same thing, right?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   He's a good man.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.320]   I know a lot of good Christians who do good things.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.360]   I just don't believe in the miracles.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.480]   I don't know if I believe that he was resurrected from the dead.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.320]   Let me ask you this morning, in your conviction about the resurrection, because that's why
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.360]   we're here this morning, to celebrate and to commemorate what he has done.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:58.400]   In your conviction, if you were to say number from zero to 10, how would you label yourself?
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.760]   Zero being, "I don't believe this.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.960]   This is all made up.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.960]   This is fake."
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:09.440]   To 10, "I'm so convicted that even if I give my life telling other people about this, that
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.440]   this is what I believe.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.440]   I believe that it's a fact.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.440]   This is what happened.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.440]   Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.440]   Everything he said was true."
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.160]   That's 10.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.800]   Some of you may have been brought here because you are a zero.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.640]   Not zero in who you are, but zero is in conviction.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.300]   I'm not sure if I really believe this, but your friend maybe have invited you so that
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.920]   you can hear the gospel and maybe convince you of this truth.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:39.520]   And then my guess is most of us fall somewhere in between the middle, right?
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.800]   Where you profess to believe, but there really isn't any evidence of this in your life.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.080]   And then many will say, "I'm about a five, right?
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.080]   I think I believe.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.040]   I grew up in the church and I have no good reason to deny it."
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.800]   But you're not a 10.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.780]   You're not living your life to sacrifice.
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.280]   You're kind of doing everything that everybody else does.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.120]   It's just that you just go to church.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.780]   However you would label yourself, my question this morning is, why are you there?
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.640]   Whether you are a zero, whether you are a four or five or six, why did you label yourself
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.780]   in that position?
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:25.420]   Is it because at the end of research, asking questions and seeking, that after you've gathered
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:31.060]   all the information, heard all the testimonies, that your final conclusion is that I don't
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.780]   believe this, right?
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.940]   Or is it simply our prejudice?
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.340]   I've chosen to believe that and just remain that way.
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.860]   I believe enough to come to church, but not believe enough to really give my life.
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.980]   I believe enough to participate in the church, enjoy the community, study the Bible, but
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.220]   to actually give my life in following this Jesus Christ and to give my life to share
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.380]   this gospel with the other people, I'm not sure if I'm there.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:06.820]   Some of you may say you're a zero, you don't believe because of the prejudice.
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.820]   Somebody come back from that.
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.980]   I've never seen that before, right?
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.060]   And simply because you haven't experienced it, it's not part of your reality.
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.980]   You say, "Well, I choose not to believe it because I've never seen it before."
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.460]   To be honest, that isn't a whole lot different than somebody maybe 200 years ago saying,
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.460]   "Hey, we're going to fly.
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.380]   We're going to get to the East Coast and the West Coast in a few hours."
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.740]   Are you kidding me?
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.340]   That can never happen.
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.380]   Or somebody maybe hundreds of years ago said that, "Hey, the earth is actually round and
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.940]   not flat."
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.820]   Are you crazy?
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:36.820]   How can it be round?
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.060]   We're all going to fall off.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.500]   So simply to reject this because it's not a part of our reality is prejudice.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.340]   That's not necessarily fact.
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:52.640]   But for us who claim to be Christians who are sort of believing but not enough to really
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.240]   forsake everything to follow Christ, why are we there?
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.240]   Is it because we've done our research and we found it's ambiguous and I've chosen to
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.560]   be a Christian agnostic?
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.780]   And so I'm comfortable here.
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:14.120]   The fact that something incredible happened in the first century is a fact.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.460]   Whether you believe it or not, that's a fact.
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:21.540]   The fact that Jews and Gentiles who hated each other for centuries, they couldn't stand
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.600]   each other.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.460]   Can you imagine if you fell asleep today and woke up a few weeks later and the Republicans
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.380]   and the Democrats became one party?
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.640]   If you're following politics, it's like that's crazy.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.140]   The hatred between the Jews and the Gentiles was much more intense than the political divide
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.140]   right now.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.020]   And that lasted for hundreds of years.
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:48.700]   They hated each other so much that the Jews wouldn't even enter the Gentile land because
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.420]   they thought it would defile them.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.180]   In fact, one of the earliest problems that they had in the early church was to get rid
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.800]   of this prejudice that they had toward one another.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:03.060]   But overnight, they started meeting together and calling each other brothers and sisters
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.020]   in Christ, Jews and Gentiles.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:13.300]   They had former runaway slaves meeting together in the same church with the slave owners,
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.180]   calling each other brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.080]   Tax collector who was considered a traitor to the nation was one of the first apostles
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.980]   who started teaching the Pharisees who were the leaders, the PhDs of theology of that
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.980]   time.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.300]   And they sat there humbly receiving instruction by these tax collectors.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:37.780]   You had zealots, you had Sadducees, you had the early church, the rich and the poor, all
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.580]   calling each other brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.760]   And this happened overnight.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:46.020]   So the fact that something incredible happened is a fact.
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:51.600]   But some people will explain that away and say maybe Jesus just hypnotized people.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.700]   Maybe the apostles made this up because they wanted to be rich and maybe they were going
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.180]   to try to make something of themselves by telling these lies.
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.340]   But none of these things stick because every one of the apostles who claimed that this
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.440]   happened died proclaiming this.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.640]   So they didn't gain it.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:14.480]   One crazy person doing that is one thing, but to have all the apostles telling this
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:20.120]   same lie and then dying, and then to have hundreds of other people who are also witnesses
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:25.960]   of his resurrection also giving their lives telling the same supposed lie.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:31.300]   So the fact that something incredible happened in the early church is a fact.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:37.920]   Now why that happened causes us to be separated between believers and unbelievers.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:44.480]   But this morning, the purpose of my sermon is not to prove to you that the resurrection
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.220]   happened.
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:53.920]   The purpose of this morning's sermon is to show you what the resurrection really proves.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:00.520]   The resurrection was so unbelievable that if you look at the account of when Jesus was
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.200]   resurrected, you'll notice something strange.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.680]   In Mark chapter 16, 1, it says, "When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:15.440]   mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might come and anoint him."
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.720]   You notice first of all here, they're not here to see his resurrection.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.720]   They're here to anoint his body, to prepare him for burial.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.720]   In other words, they didn't come to see the resurrected body.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.320]   You notice something else that's missing here?
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.640]   The disciples.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.000]   If you saw the account and Jesus made it clear what was going to happen, you would have thought
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.640]   that all of his disciples would have been waiting outside of his tomb.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.960]   Like okay, Friday, one day, Saturday, Sabbath, we can't go there, but after the Sabbath,
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.000]   something spectacular is going to happen.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.520]   Nothing, right?
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:57.680]   The only people who actually even show up are these ladies in tears.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:02.680]   They actually went there to take care of his body, and that was it.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.200]   Mark's account of what takes place and how he goes to the cross, his point is made very
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.440]   clear.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:15.920]   Three separate times, Mark announces crystal clear that the disciples should have known,
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.380]   that they should have all have known.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:25.640]   In Mark chapter 8, 31 to 32, the first revelation where it says, "And he, Jesus, began to teach
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:30.560]   them that the Son of Man himself must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.820]   and chief priests and the scribes and be killed.
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:41.400]   And after three days, rise again, and he was stating the matter plainly."
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.760]   Mark wanted to make sure that they weren't confused.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.760]   They were not at the tomb because Jesus was kind of teaching it and he was using strange
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.880]   vocabulary and it didn't make much sense to them.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.120]   He says, "No, he made it very plain."
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:02.200]   And then very next part, it says, "And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him."
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.560]   The leader among the apostles, the guy who typically puts his foot in his mouth.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:14.480]   I can imagine in eternity, Peter in heaven, and I'm sure that's not going to happen, but
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.880]   he's forever known as the man who rebuked God.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.840]   He rebuked God, the leader among the apostles.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.760]   It was so crazy what Jesus was saying.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.080]   We're about to go into Jerusalem and to conquer Rome and you're saying we're going to die
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.840]   and resurrect in the third day.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.240]   Don't say that again.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.280]   Think about that.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.240]   He saw Lazarus raised from the dead, Jesus walking on the water.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:44.720]   He saw the 5,000 men and women who were fed.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:51.560]   He saw all the miracles, but that his prophecy of a death and resurrection was so out of
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.400]   whack that Peter, I don't know what was going through his head.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.860]   Maybe he thinks, some people think that maybe he was older than Jesus and he was pulling
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.200]   an Asian hierarchy on him, maybe.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:07.320]   I'm older than you and you haven't lived long enough and stop saying that.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:12.480]   Mark makes it very plain that Jesus made it very clear what was about to happen.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.600]   Mark 9, 31 and 32, "For he was teaching his disciples and telling them, 'The Son of Man
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:22.200]   is to be delivered into the hands of men and they will kill him and when he has been killed,
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.240]   he will rise three days later.'
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:31.880]   But they did not understand the statement and they were afraid to ask."
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.120]   You ever get so behind in your class that you can't ask anymore?
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.720]   You know what I realized?
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.400]   You need to know something to be even asking questions.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.000]   Have you ever experienced that?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.760]   You've been in class, when I asked this in the first service, almost everybody nodded
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:48.760]   their head.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.760]   I think there were a bunch of college students in there.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.440]   Maybe you remember, you're in a math class or history class and you should have asked
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.760]   maybe three months ago, but you just kind of like, "Okay, maybe I'll get over it."
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.080]   And you realize that you're so far behind that you can't even ask the question.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.520]   That's exactly what was happening with the disciples.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.200]   They sat there and Jesus was talking and they didn't understand anything.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.760]   But they said, "I can't ask him now."
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.760]   So they were afraid to ask.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:23.160]   In other words, it was so beyond their comprehension, they couldn't even ask him the question.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:29.520]   Mark says it again, third time, chapter 10, 32 to 34, and again, he took the 12 aside
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:35.480]   and began to tell them what was going to happen to him, saying, "Behold, we are going to Jerusalem.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.080]   The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.880]   him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.920]   They will mock him and spit on him and scourge him and kill him.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.480]   And three days later, he will rise again."
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:56.160]   Mark was making it very clear that they should have been at the grave.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.360]   They should have been anticipating.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.040]   They should have known, but they did not.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:06.360]   In fact, not that they just didn't know or they just missed it.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:12.800]   Mark's account tells us that they refused to believe in Mark chapter 16, 10 through
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.800]   14.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:19.120]   It says, "She went, reported to those who had been with him while they were mourning
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.120]   and weeping.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.400]   When they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they refused to believe
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.400]   it."
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.160]   It's like, "Oh, that's hard to believe."
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.520]   He said, "They refused to believe it."
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.060]   After he appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking along their
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:42.120]   way to the country, they went away and reported it to the others, but they did not believe
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.200]   them either.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.460]   Now you had the first account is that they refused to believe it.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.800]   The other two people, they come, "No, no, no, we saw him.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.800]   We actually saw him."
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.280]   And they said, "No, that can't be."
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.600]   Verse 14, "After he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table,
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.000]   and he reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they had not
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.120]   believed those who had seen him and after he had risen."
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:18.420]   I mean, they were so hardened that even after Jesus makes it plain over and over and even
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:23.780]   after the resurrection, not only were they not there at the grave, even after reports
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:29.220]   started rolling in from other people, they said, "No, that can't possibly happen."
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.420]   Because it was beyond their understanding.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:36.620]   Because you have to remember, they already witnessed.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.240]   They already witnessed Lazarus coming back from the dead.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.360]   They already witnessed Jesus walking on the water.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.280]   For three years, they've seen miracle after miracle after miracle.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:55.060]   But for some reason, his death and resurrection, they could not believe.
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:00.240]   In fact, in Luke chapter 24, 10 through 11, Luke goes even further than that when he says,
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.640]   "Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna Mary, a mother of James, also the other women with
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:10.760]   them, were telling these things to the apostles, but these words appeared to them as nonsense,
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.840]   and they would not believe them."
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.040]   Did they not believe simply because it was too hard to believe that somebody would come
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.040]   back from the dead?
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:24.180]   I mean, think about that logically.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.760]   They saw Lazarus coming back from the dead.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.880]   Jesus deliberately waits until Lazarus dies.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.040]   This happened just a few days ago.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:37.440]   All these Jews from everywhere were coming into town because they heard of Lazarus' resurrection.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:45.000]   So were they disheartened because they thought that no one can come back from the dead?
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.120]   That doesn't sound logical, right?
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.240]   After everything that they've seen.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:54.560]   Well, we don't have to ponder about that question because Mark makes it very clear why they
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.320]   didn't see, why they missed this.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.520]   It wasn't simply because it was a spectacular thing.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.240]   There was something else going on.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:06.560]   In Mark, going back to Mark chapter 8, 31 through 37, right?
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.760]   In verse 31 and 32 is where Jesus says he's going to die and rise again on the third day.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:17.680]   Peter takes him aside, rebukes him, and then Jesus turns aside in verse 33, seeing his
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:23.640]   disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.280]   Now think about that, right?
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.760]   Peter, at least on the surface, looks like he's concerned for Jesus.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.280]   How can you go to the, "I love you."
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.520]   Why would you allow yourself to die?
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.480]   This doesn't make any sense.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.400]   And in response to that, Jesus says, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.560]   There was something a lot more sinister going on.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:52.440]   There was something much more deeper going on than Peter just being concerned for his
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.440]   master.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:21:00.680]   "Get behind me, Satan, for you are not setting your mind on God's interest but man's."
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:08.080]   You may have the best interest, but in the end, you have no idea what God is doing.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.480]   You're man-centered instead of God-centered.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.120]   And then he spells out what's happening here.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:20.320]   So I want you to labor with me to pay attention to this because if we're not careful, we can
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:26.600]   live our whole lives being guilty of the same thing that the apostles are guilty of here
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:34.040]   before the resurrection because it's subtle, because it's very subtle.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:38.860]   In verse 34, he says, "He summoned the crowd with the disciples and said to them, 'If anyone
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:44.280]   wishes to come after me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.'"
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.920]   I know that you know those verses well because it's repeated.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.920]   We sing it.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.920]   We memorize it.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.720]   If you've been raised in the church, you know that passage well.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:59.720]   If you want to follow me, you must deny yourself, pick up your cross, and then follow me.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:06.520]   You know that he was saying this to his disciples because they couldn't believe the prophecy
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:14.080]   that he just made because they were so filled with their own glory that when Jesus told
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.480]   them they was going to die and resurrect, it didn't fit their paradigm.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.480]   Everything that Jesus did up to this point was awesome.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.540]   And that's why they were thinking if we just stick with him when the kingdom comes and
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:33.240]   he is elevated in his glory, their mindset was we're going to benefit from this.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.520]   We're going to be glorified with him.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.880]   And their whole mindset, their paradigm was that I'm going to benefit from being attached
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.000]   to this Messiah.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.720]   And that's why when Jesus said he's going to die and resurrect, everything that he did,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.920]   even raising Lazarus from the dead, only heightened his glory.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.880]   But if you die, how does that fit?
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.040]   It didn't fit.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.880]   And so they heard it through one ear, but because it didn't fit their paradigm, they
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.440]   just kind of swept it under the rug.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.680]   And it's to them, it says, you must deny yourself.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:14.000]   The reason why you are blind is because you are trying to save your life on your own.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.960]   Whoever wishes to save his life will lose it.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.400]   He's talking to his disciples, disciples who stuck with him, disciples who didn't leave
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.760]   when everybody else left.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:30.000]   He's talking to his disciples and telling them, if you are trying to save your life,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   you will lose it.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.720]   He who loses his life for me in the gospel will save it.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.120]   For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.400]   For what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.400]   You catch that?
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.560]   Do you understand the gravity of what he is saying here?
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.820]   You're concerned about your flesh.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.520]   What God's concerned about is our soul.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.440]   To the disciples, we're thinking that, you know, I can make the sacrifice, I can leave
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.160]   behind, you know, whatever we left behind.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.800]   I can leave behind maybe a successful fishing business.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.520]   I can leave behind my family because there's greater glory waiting.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.080]   And that's what they were thinking.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:16.000]   And then when Jesus was coming into Jerusalem, the disciples were thinking the same thing.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:24.880]   So here comes, when he conquers Rome, who's going to sit into the left and to the right?
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.880]   And they were completely blinded, even though Jesus made it very clear because it didn't
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.520]   fit their box.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.600]   Mark chapter 9, 31 to 37, verse 31, he says, "I will be killed and raised on the third
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.680]   day," verse 32.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.800]   But they did not understand the statement and they were afraid to ask him.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   They came to Capernaum and when he was in the house, he began to question them, "What
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.000]   were you discussing on the way?"
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.160]   But they kept silent.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.160]   Think about that.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.120]   Jesus just told them he's going to die.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.600]   He's going to be crucified and be raised on the third day.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.080]   You would think that they would turn around and say, "What does he mean by that?"
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.640]   Why would our Messiah die?
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.640]   Why would they torture him?
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.040]   Why would he allow them to do that?
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.560]   All these years they wanted to kill him and he would just walk through the crowd and disappear.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.120]   Storms would come and lifetime fishermen were afraid to die and Jesus says, "Stop," and
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.160]   it stops.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:25.120]   Why would that man with that kind of power, who even has power over death, raises Lazarus,
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.680]   a dead man from the grave, why would he die?
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.080]   You would think that that's the conversation that they would have.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.080]   I don't understand.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.080]   I can't ask him, so let's try to figure this out.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:39.680]   Instead, they lean over and say, "Who's the greatest?"
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.000]   That's what they were discussing.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.800]   They kept silent for on the way they had discussed with one another which of them was the greatest.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.840]   So sitting down, he called the twelve and said to them, "If anyone wants to be first,
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.200]   he shall be last of all and servant of all."
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.960]   And this is where he takes a child and he says, "You must receive this child, that we
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.760]   must be like a child."
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.680]   He's not saying, "You must be like a child and just be naive."
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.640]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.600]   I've heard some people say, "You must become like a child.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.600]   Stop asking questions."
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.120]   Don't ask questions because when you tell a child what to do, they just do it.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.760]   So you just do it.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.620]   If Jesus says to believe like a child, say, "Okay, I believe."
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.040]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:31.400]   What he's saying is because these disciples are jockeying to get a higher position from
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.400]   one another, he's pointing to a child who has nothing.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.360]   They have no boarding rights.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.240]   They have no wealth.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:46.720]   You ever wonder, you know, why children have such an easy time making friends, right?
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.800]   And I'm sure many of you probably will agree with me.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.760]   The older we get, the harder it is to make friends, right?
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.480]   Because when you're older, you start like, "Well, what do you do for a living?
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.920]   What school did you go to?
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.240]   How old are your children?
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.280]   When did they start walking?
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.200]   What are they reading?"
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.600]   And so we have a tendency to kind of jockey to see, "Am I older than you?
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.600]   Am I younger than you?
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.840]   Are you better looking?
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.840]   What house do you live?
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.840]   Where do you live?
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.840]   How much money do you make?
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.840]   What do you do?"
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.200]   And so we're all kind of like secretly jockeying to see and measure.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.320]   And so we have to kind of get over that in order to become friends.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:30.560]   You see little children, they get together, they get on a playground, and they slide down
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.840]   with another kid that they met for the first time, turn around, "Hey, you want to be my
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.880]   friend?"
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.120]   And the kid, "Okay."
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.360]   And they become lifelong friends, right?
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.840]   Why is it easier for young children to become friends that way?
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.840]   They have nothing.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.840]   They have no pride.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.360]   They just kind of like, "Okay, let's get together."
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:58.840]   Jesus was referring to a child who is now prideful and measuring from one another.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:03.760]   So He's talking to a child who has nothing to boast of, and He says, "If you are measuring
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.560]   one another and trying to figure out who's the greatest," He said, "that's your greatest
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:12.240]   hindrance into the kingdom."
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.520]   That's why they were so blind.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:21.100]   I hope this really sinks in beyond the surface.
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.080]   And I mentioned this before, the health and wealth gospel, we have a tendency to think
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.920]   the health and wealth gospel is over there, right?
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.920]   They have strange hair.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:35.860]   They, you know, ride around in $100 million jet airplanes, and they beg for money.
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.640]   Those are the health and wealth gospel people.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.840]   That's not us.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:49.920]   You have no idea how deeply this health and wealth gospel has been rooted inside of us.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.160]   And when I ask you the question from zero to 10, where your conviction is, how much
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:02.600]   of our 2, 3, 4, 5 conviction is directly linked to this health and wealth gospel?
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:07.280]   Because we are blinded by our own passion.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.400]   Mark makes it very clear.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   Again, in verse 32 to 34, he says, "He will be mocked, scourged, killed, and raised on
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.480]   the third day."
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.840]   And then third time's even worse.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.880]   James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus saying, "Teacher, we want you to
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.040]   do for us whatever we ask."
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.200]   Now, I think they're asking that question is because at some point, remember Jesus said,
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.520]   "If you abide in me, my word's abiding in you.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.120]   Ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you."
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.560]   Jesus taught that repeatedly.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560]   Ask and it will be done.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.240]   Knock and it will be opened.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.240]   Seek and you will find.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.440]   So it's like, oh, ask and you're going to do it?
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.720]   So they probably remember that and were throwing it back to Jesus and say, "You said so, and
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.680]   we're going to ask."
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.920]   Will you do anything for us?
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.920]   What do you want me to do?
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.520]   He said, they said to him, "Grant that we may sit one on your right and one on your
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.920]   left in your glory."
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:03.200]   But Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.840]   Are you able to drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism which I am
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.840]   baptized?"
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.560]   Now, what does he mean by the cup?
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:19.000]   He's about to go to the cross and absorb the sins of mankind, past, present, and future.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.600]   He was going to be, the Son of God was going to be in so much agony that he's going to
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.760]   cry out to his Father, "Eloi, Eloi, l'amak sabachthani?"
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.320]   Why have you forsaken me?
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.240]   That's the cup that he's referring to.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.280]   Are you able to drink that cup?
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.760]   Think about the arrogance of James and John.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:45.000]   And their answer is, "Yeah, okay, we can drink that cup."
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.680]   I mean, if there's any time that any of these disciples deserve to be crushed, it was right
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.000]   here.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.360]   Think about the blasphemy of what they were saying.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:07.040]   The Son of God took on human form, humbled himself as a child, spent 33 years in agony,
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.800]   walking in the sinful earth, knowing that he would die for these people who are betraying
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.080]   him, trying to kill him, question him, backstabbing him.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.640]   Are you able to drink that cup?
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.280]   And he said, "Oh, yeah, sure."
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.920]   Jesus said to them, "The cup that I drink, you shall drink."
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.240]   He's not saying that they're going to take away mankind's sin.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.160]   He said, "You're going to suffer.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.240]   You're going to suffer.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.160]   And you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.920]   But to sit on my right, on my left, this is not mine to give, but it is for those whom
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.640]   it has been prepared.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:50.000]   Whoever wishes to come, become great among you, shall be your servant."
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.680]   You notice the theme over and over again?
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.480]   Jesus says, "I'm going to die, I'm going to resurrect."
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.200]   He said, "Well, who's going to be the greatest?
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.320]   I'm going to die, I'm going to resurrect.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.320]   Who's going to sit on the left?
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.440]   Who's going to the right?
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.320]   I'm going to die, I'm going to resurrect.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.680]   But who's the greatest?"
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:14.000]   They were so fixated on their own glory that they could not hear what Jesus was saying.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.320]   That even after Jesus died, and even after He resurrected, they said that could not be
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:25.200]   because it doesn't fit what they wanted.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.900]   Why is this so important for us?
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:36.220]   Because the Bible says that at the end, many will come in my name and say that I have done
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.500]   this and I have done that.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.580]   And Jesus says, "I have no relationship with you.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:49.980]   I never knew you because you were pursuing your own kingdom in my name."
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:54.740]   And so when Jesus makes it very plain, if you want to come after me, deny yourself,
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:02.100]   pick up your cross and follow me, you hear it, but it gets shelved underneath.
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:09.180]   You know the words, you know plainly what the scripture says, we read it, we memorize
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:17.280]   it, and then we go off the rest of our lives seeking our own kingdom, seeking our own glory.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.740]   And then we teach it to our children.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.540]   We have Sunday schools.
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.700]   We have prayer meetings.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:32.100]   And yet, when you look at the totality of our life, we're not pursuing Christ.
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:37.220]   We're pursuing our own kingdom in the name of Christ.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.140]   And this is why this is so important.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.540]   Are we where we're at?
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:48.500]   Whether you are a zero, whether you are a six or a seven.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:54.180]   Simply because that's where it's the most convenient for us.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:34:04.020]   Because being a five allows me to hedge my bet that I can have all the things that the
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:09.540]   world gives and enjoy, and also enjoy all the benefits of supposedly following Christ.
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.540]   And so hedging my bet.
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.260]   You know what hedging my bet is?
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.140]   You don't win or lose.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.500]   That's what hedging a bet is.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:21.380]   Hedging a bet is you're betting that a team is going to win, but you're also betting that
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.060]   the team is going to lose.
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:30.100]   So you feel like you're part of the game, but you have really nothing invested.
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:35.540]   It's just so that you can look like you're invested.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:40.100]   That was why they missed the death and resurrection of Christ.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:47.620]   Our churches are filled with people who are living their life hedging their bets.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:51.060]   We need revival in our generation.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:57.580]   If we're going to be the light in this generation, we need people who are convicted.
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:01.660]   We need people who are genuinely believe this is it.
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.580]   That Christ truly was resurrected from the dead.
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:14.420]   Our own lust, our own desire to have the American dream has blinded us to think that the Christianity
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:18.140]   that we experience in our generation is normal.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:23.900]   When we know clearly, when you read the scripture, that it is very plain.
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:29.500]   That what Jesus calls us to is to pick up our own cross and follow Him as well.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:35.220]   Have we missed the resurrection ourselves?
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:42.460]   Because we have somehow mixed our own glory with His glory.
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.900]   Samson and Delilah is a perfect example of that.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:49.500]   How can Samson be so dumb?
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.980]   Delilah is like trying to kill him.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:56.980]   "If you really loved me, you would teach me how to kill you."
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:03.300]   And Samson tells her anyway, because he was so entrenched in his own lust.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.220]   He couldn't see.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:10.060]   In Romans 1.18, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness,
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:13.620]   men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:20.860]   See, let me kind of wrap up this way.
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:25.780]   The disciples before Jesus died and resurrected, that was their mindset.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:33.740]   If you remember, Jesus in the gospel of Luke, you know that encounter where Jesus tells
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.800]   them that you must become the least to be the greatest?
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:41.020]   That happens after the Passover.
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.380]   Mark's gospel is organized by theme.
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.520]   Luke's gospel is organized chronologically.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:51.900]   So in Luke's gospel, this encounter happens after Jesus gets on His knees, washes their
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.860]   feet, and He tells them, "He who is the least among you will be the greatest."
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:00.140]   He tells them that, and He tells them after the Passover that someone is going to betray
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.980]   Him.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:07.980]   After He tells them that, in verse 24, a dispute among them as to which one of them was regarded
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.980]   to be the greatest.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.260]   Wow.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:15.660]   Man, I don't know how patient He was.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.980]   It wasn't just Judas.
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:24.660]   All His disciples, He's about to go to Gethsemane, He's about to be crucified, and that night,
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:30.220]   that night, they were arguing with each other, "Who's the greatest?"
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:34.260]   Verse 26, "But it is not this way with you, but with one who is the greatest among you
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.580]   must become like the youngest and the leader like the servant.
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.300]   For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves?
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:46.060]   Is it not the one who reclines at the table, but I am among you as the one who serves?"
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:53.060]   And He's trying to tell them, "You must break out of this paradigm.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.700]   You must break out of this paradigm, because if you do not break out of this paradigm,
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:58.700]   you will not live."
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:08.380]   See, this Christianity that has become normal in our culture is we're constantly hedging
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.640]   our bet, never fully committed to Christ.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:18.500]   We have some of us in the world, and some of it committed to Christ, and we wonder why
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:22.960]   revival never breaks out.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:27.100]   As I'm reading this, I'm like, "Man, He must have been so frustrated."
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:33.740]   I mean, He's agonizing on His knees at Gethsemane, crying out to His Father.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:34.740]   Is there another way?
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:38.420]   Because He sees agony coming.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.400]   He sees pain coming.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:50.980]   He sees the suffering and the separation with His Father coming the very next morning.
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:57.420]   And as He is crying out to the Father, all His disciples could think of is who's the
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.900]   greatest?
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.600]   Who's going to make it?
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.740]   Who's going to make more money?
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.140]   Who's going to have the glory?
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.060]   Who's going to raise the best children?
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:13.740]   Who's going to have the best house?
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:19.020]   I can imagine the frustration of our Lord.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.940]   And yet He did not quit.
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:27.740]   Although He was tempted, is there another way?
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:34.340]   But not my will, Your will be done.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:44.340]   And He willed Himself to the cross, and He received the punishment that you and I deserve.
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:52.300]   Was crucified, cried out to His Father.
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:56.420]   His disciples needed to know this.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:06.300]   And that's why in the very next verse, verse 31, Jesus says to Simon, "Simon, Simon, behold,
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:12.480]   Satan has demanded permission to sift you like wheat.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:19.540]   But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail, and you, once you have turned
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:24.340]   again, strengthen your brothers."
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.100]   Peter's response in verse 32, "But He said to him, 'Lord, with you, I am ready to go
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:32.460]   both to prison and to death.'"
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:36.140]   In other passages, Peter goes further than that, and he says, "They may all fail you,
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.860]   but I'm not going to fail you.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:38.860]   I love you."
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:45.140]   And I believe Peter really did love Jesus.
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.700]   I'm not going to fail you.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:54.820]   But Jesus says to him, "The rooster will not crow today until you have denied me three
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.700]   times that you know me."
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:01.500]   You know, when I first read this, I was so confused because Jesus just said, "I prayed
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.620]   so that your faith would not fail you."
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.340]   And then when Peter said, "I will not fail you," He said, "No, you're going to fail me
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.340]   miserably."
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.620]   So what does He mean by this?
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:17.140]   Jesus already knew He was going to deny him three times, but that's not what He meant.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:22.740]   Because Jesus already was preparing for His return.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:29.620]   But after you failed me, get back up and feed my sheep.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.720]   That's why we see Him after the resurrection, Jesus saying, "Do you really love me more
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.720]   than these?
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.820]   Do you really love me?"
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.820]   And He restores him.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:42.340]   As He denied Jesus three times, He restores him three times.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:49.460]   You see, until their pride and their glory is washed out of them, the death and resurrection
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:54.340]   of Christ has no effect on them.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.340]   And the fastest way to be humbled is humiliation.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:03.020]   You know, we can work for years trying to be humble, but when God wants us to be humble,
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.620]   we get humiliated.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:09.700]   Peter can't stand in front of the crowd and say, "Look what I did.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.300]   I persevered and I would walk with Jesus."
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:17.740]   All of that went out the door when he denied Jesus to his face.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:22.100]   So when God calls him to preach the gospel, he can't keep preaching the gospel as a humbled
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.980]   sinner forgiven for his sins.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:32.620]   And so all the disciples who are constantly concerned about their own glory, God allowed
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:38.860]   to be humiliated so that they can be used for His glory.
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:47.540]   Brothers and sisters, this morning, this message that Mark is trying to make so clear to all
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:57.020]   of us, that this subtle desire for our own glory blinds us to things that are so plainly
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.420]   true in the scripture.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.940]   He who seeks his life will lose it.
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:09.460]   He who loses his life for my sake will find it.
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:14.540]   Sanctification isn't simply knowing more Bible, being more disciplined, sharing the gospel
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.260]   with more people, doing hard things for Jesus.
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.900]   All of these things are great things.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:25.420]   But ultimately, sanctification is dying to ourselves.
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:32.300]   Dying to ourselves, our ambition, our desires, knowing that this world and its passion, that
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:40.140]   all is passing away, that Jesus is preparing us for the kingdom that is coming.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.180]   And that's his call of the gospel.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:45.780]   And that's why the death and resurrection happened for us.
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:50.060]   So I pray this morning as we celebrate and remember his death and resurrection that we
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.940]   first and foremost examine ourselves.
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:56.500]   If we said we were five, why are we at five?
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:03.380]   Is this simply because five is a much more convenient place to be?
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.200]   Have we carefully examined, do I believe this?
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:12.660]   And if Jesus was resurrected from the dead, if Jesus said who he was is actually true,
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:17.940]   if what he said about eternity is true, if heaven and hell actually exist exactly as
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:26.540]   he said and the resurrection of Christ proves it, how does that change our life today?
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:36.020]   I pray with all my heart that every single one of us would at minimum seek, ask and knock
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.700]   that he may answer.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.420]   Let's pray.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:49.140]   Again, as we asked our worship team to come, if you're here as a guest and somebody invited
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:52.900]   you to come, I want to read a passage for you.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:57.020]   And this is true even for the believers.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:00.420]   He says in Romans 10, 9 through 13, that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus as
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:07.420]   Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:13.420]   For with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses,
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.740]   resulting in salvation.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:20.340]   For the scripture says whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:24.900]   For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.260]   in riches for all who call on him.
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:34.980]   For whoever, whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:38.180]   I pray that you would believe that and be saved.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:46.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
