[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   All right, let's pray together.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.200]   Father, this morning we ask that you would feed your sheep and that as you feed us that
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.000]   we would chew well, digest well, and that your Word would bear fruit in our lives for
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.520]   your glory, for our joy.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.520]   And I pray that you would just hide me behind the pulpit so you would speak and that for
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.000]   us that all of our hearts really would be fertile and we would take heed to what you
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.240]   say and that we would respond appropriately in worship and gratitude and in faithfulness.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.400]   So we pray for your help this morning.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.080]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.280]   Our text this morning is going to come from Jonah 4, 1 through 11.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.200]   Jonah chapter 4, verses 1 through 11.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.880]   I'll give you a couple seconds to kind of flip there.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.440]   If you can't find it, it is on the screen.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.640]   So Jonah 4, 1 through 11.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.680]   But it greatly displeased Jonah and he became angry.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.200]   He prayed to the Lord and said, "Please, Lord, was not this what I said while I was still
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.160]   in my own country?
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.600]   Therefore in order to forestall this, I fled to Tarshish, for I knew that you are a gracious
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.400]   and compassionate God, slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness and one who relents concerning
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.400]   calamity.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.960]   Therefore, now, O Lord, please take my life from me, for death is better to me than life."
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.640]   The Lord said, "Do you have good reason to be angry?"
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.360]   Then Jonah went out from the city and sat east of it.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.960]   There he made a shelter for himself and sat under it in the shade until he could see what
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.960]   would happen in the city.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.280]   So the Lord God appointed a plant and it grew up over Jonah to be a shade over his head
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.840]   to deliver him from his discomfort.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.880]   And Jonah was extremely happy about the plant.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.960]   The God appointed a worm and when dawn came the next day and it attacked the plant and
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.960]   it withered.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.000]   And when the sun came up, God appointed a scorching east wind and the sun beat down
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.720]   on Jonah's head so that he became faint and begged with all his soul to die saying, "Death
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.180]   is better to me than life."
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.440]   Then God said to Jonah, "Do you have good reason to be angry about the plant?"
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.320]   And he said, "I have good reason to be angry even to death."
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.800]   Then the Lord said, "You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work and which
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.720]   you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and perished overnight.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.400]   Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city in which there are more than 120,000
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.920]   persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand as well as many
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.040]   animals?"
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.400]   The story of Jonah and the great fish is one of the most famous stories in all the Old
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.520]   Testament.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.000]   Even if you hadn't grown up in the church, you may have already been familiar with the
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.640]   story of Jonah.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.680]   It's by far the most familiar of all the prophetic books and it's one of the easier books of
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.380]   the Old Testament to read since it pretty much reads and flows like a children's story.
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.080]   It's not hard to understand why the story of Jonah is pretty much in every children's
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.500]   Bible.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.360]   It's a fun and very interesting story to tell.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.720]   Jonah is actually the only minor prophet mentioned even in the Quran.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.840]   He's called Dol Nun, which means an apostle of Allah, the one of the fish.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.760]   Jonah's prophecy was also very well known to the Jewish people in Jesus' day.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.240]   Jesus referenced the prophet Jonah on at least two separate occasions in predicting his death
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.360]   and resurrection.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.880]   The Jonah narrative would have a very clean and happy ending if it ended at chapter three,
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.920]   but you have chapter four, all of which we just read.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.920]   Chapter four is different, as you may have noticed.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.640]   It's so jarringly different that it doesn't quite seem to fit the rest of the story.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.920]   Since Jonah's reaction doesn't quite line up with the positive moods of our children's
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:25.120]   Bibles, many of them conveniently leave the details of chapter four out.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.800]   The Jonah four is super important.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.480]   We learn about God in Jonah chapter four.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.760]   Chapter four simultaneously gives us insight into both the arrogance and the helplessness
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.440]   of man.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.600]   I'm going to structure today's sermon in a way that it's hopefully easy for you to follow
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.800]   and track along.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.800]   Who is Jonah?
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.020]   We'll start there.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.400]   Why is Jonah so angry in chapter four?
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.760]   What do we learn about mankind through Jonah's prophecy?
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.200]   What do we learn about God through Jonah's prophecy?
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.060]   For you guys who are scrambling to write all this out, the outline and all the references
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.920]   are on the app.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.680]   If you miss anything, you can go there.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.360]   Who is Jonah?
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.200]   He is referenced very briefly in 2 Kings 14.25.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.360]   The reference isn't even a direct reference.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.960]   He's referred to in passing when the exploits of an evil king are recounted.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.960]   Here we go.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.600]   "He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath as far as the sea of the
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.320]   Arabah according to the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, which he spoke through
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.160]   his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet who was of Gath Hefer."
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.080]   The he there at the beginning is King Jeroboam of the northern kingdom of Israel.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.320]   There are two King Jeroboams in the Old Testament, and they are both very significant.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.080]   They are both wicked kings of the rebellious northern kingdom of Israel, and they are not
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.200]   related to one another, and their reigns are separated by about 150 years.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.960]   This one, this Jeroboam is a second one, so he is often called Jeroboam II, even though
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.440]   there is no relation to the first.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.880]   The people of God at this time were in a civil war, and King Jeroboam reigned 41 years in
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.160]   the northern kingdom.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:24.400]   Before this Jeroboam became king, the nation had become very poor and was spiraling downward.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.560]   It was one of the darker times in the history of the north.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.680]   It says in two verses later, in verse 27, that God saved them by the hand of Jeroboam,
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.400]   the son of Joash.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.160]   During this wicked king's evil reign, the north enjoyed one of its most prosperous and
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.560]   successful chapters in its history.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:53.240]   This was the golden age of Israel, and they went from hard times to prosperity, and who
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:00.080]   was in Jeroboam's ears giving instruction is Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet of
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   God.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.400]   So, Jonah spoke, Jeroboam listened, and we see that the territory of the northern kingdom
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.600]   expanded and got restored.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.520]   And now, outside of what we see in the book of Jonah, this is all we know about Jonah
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.640]   the prophet.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.000]   But Jonah was a prominent figure in Jeroboam's reign, hence the mention, okay?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.640]   And we can assume that Jonah was instrumental in the growth and the restoration of the northern
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.320]   kingdom.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.520]   The nation was very wealthy and very powerful, and it appeared on the surface, anyway, that
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:43.000]   God was blessing rebellious Israel, and I assume Jonah was a big reason for this success.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.360]   And so, sometime during Jonah's ministry, he gets a preaching assignment from God.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.400]   Okay, Jonah 1, 1 through 3.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.720]   The word of the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amittai, saying, "Arise, go to Nineveh,
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.840]   the great city, and cry against it, for their wickedness has come up before me."
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.760]   And Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.400]   Now this mighty prophet doesn't look too good here in the opening verses of Jonah.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.160]   God tells him to preach to the Ninevites, and Jonah takes off completely in a different
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.160]   direction.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:25.040]   And this prophet, the mouthpiece of God, rebels and goes against what God would have him do.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.920]   He literally tries to flee the command of God.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.680]   It's like God telling me to go to San Francisco, but I immediately get on a flight going to
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   Hawaii.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.400]   Okay, so that's kind of geographically what you can think of.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:43.200]   Why would this Jonah, this man of God, do such a thing?
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.680]   So we will look at the why of the disobedience a little bit later in the passage, but first,
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:53.920]   I'd like for us to look at what happened to cause Jonah to be so angry in chapter 4.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:01.560]   The text says that he actually begged with all his soul to die.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.560]   Okay?
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.680]   That's pretty angry.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:11.160]   So verse 1, "But it greatly displeased Jonah, and he became angry."
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.960]   So here in verse 1, this "it" gives Jonah great displeasure.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.400]   Jonah's great displeasure leads to rage.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.000]   The word for displeasure in verse 1 is like "ra-ah."
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.760]   It means injurious, evil, hurtful.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.000]   And the word for angry, similar root, "ha-ra."
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.320]   So basically, the feel of the verse reads like this.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:41.280]   Jonah was enraged by this evil, and he was raging with rage.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.080]   So clearly, he's pretty mad.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:50.880]   He's very mad, and because he's already mad, when God takes away a plant that Jonah was
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.600]   using as a shade, then he becomes furious.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.880]   You see in verse 8 and 9 that he begged with all his soul to die, saying, "Death is better
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.640]   to me than life."
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.160]   Then God said to Jonah, "Do you have good reason to be angry about the plant?"
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.120]   And he said, "I have good reasoning to be angry even to death."
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.920]   So you could see him seething.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.720]   He is so angry, he begs with all his soul to die.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.600]   He is not just a little bit irritated with God's plan, he's out of his mind with rage.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.600]   So what happened?
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.600]   Okay?
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.400]   What is the "it" that greatly displeased Jonah?
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.120]   I'm going to walk you through some of the details of this story, most of which you likely
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.960]   already are familiar with.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.960]   Chapter 1, against his will, Jonah is called to preach a message to the Ninevites.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.800]   He rebels against his call, he gets caught in a storm, and then he requests to be tossed
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.600]   overboard because he knows that the storm is because of him.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.400]   He volunteers to be tossed to his death into the raging sea, and my guess is he was very
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.640]   glad to do this.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:02.360]   I think he really preferred to drown over preaching to the Ninevites.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.080]   But man, God won't let this guy die.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.240]   He sends a fish, and the giant fish, often assumed to be a whale, sometimes referred
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.800]   in scripture as a sea monster, so he's pretty big, swallows him up.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:26.720]   This poor dude is stuck in the stinky belly of the fish for three days, unable to die.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.760]   So chapter 2, we don't know exactly what brings about the change of heart, but most of chapter
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.680]   2 is a prayer.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.720]   So we see him calling out to God in prayer, and in his prayer, a pledge is made to fulfill
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:44.520]   a vow, and the tone of this prayer is generally more pensive and thankful than upset.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:50.040]   So you kind of just assume, okay, he calmed down a little bit, which makes his anger in
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.520]   chapter 4 even more confusing.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.280]   Chapter 3 is very interesting.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.840]   It's almost comical.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.760]   God repeats the charge to Jonah to preach his word in the city, and this time, Jonah
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.560]   obliges.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.720]   He takes a one-day's walk into the heart of the city, and his message is summed up in
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.600]   just a single sentence, only five words in the Hebrew.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.800]   He says, "Forty days, and Nineveh will be overthrown."
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.040]   The message translation actually says, "Nineveh will be smashed."
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:26.660]   So that's a simple message, and what follows is comedy.
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:31.040]   So Jonah 3, 5 through 8, "Then the people believed in God, and they called a fast and
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.600]   put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.920]   And when the word reached the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, laid aside his robe
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.160]   from himself, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in the ashes.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.680]   He issued a proclamation, and it said, 'In Nineveh, by the decree of the king and his
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:54.720]   nobles, do not let man, beast, herd, or flock taste a thing.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.480]   Do not let them eat or drink water, but both man and beast must be covered with sackcloth,
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.960]   and let men call on God earnestly, that each may turn from his wicked way and from the
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.160]   violence which is in his hands.'"
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.720]   So the people of Nineveh believe.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.520]   They call a fast.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.400]   The king decrees a citywide movement of repentance.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.200]   And they are so serious about showing God their repentance that they declare a fast
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.080]   that applies even to all the animals.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.260]   All the citizens are ordered to clothe themselves in sackcloth, and the king so desperately
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:32.000]   wants to show God that they are repentant that he even decrees that the people put sackcloth
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.520]   on their animals too.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.160]   And that's a very funny scene to me.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.400]   A Ninevite just running, trying to chase his sheep, trying to put sackcloth over their
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   heads.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.560]   So that's what is here in the narrative.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.480]   So these guys are spooked.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.560]   They're really serious about repenting.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.560]   And the children's Bibles make them look kind of like buffoons.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.720]   They're very simple, right?
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.120]   And what a funny group of people.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.600]   This would be funnier if it weren't the Assyrians we were reading about here, and if it weren't
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.040]   Nineveh we're talking about here.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:11.800]   Jonah, just walking into the center of Nineveh is like you or me walking into Pyongyang,
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.480]   North Korea, and going completely untouched.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.640]   But somehow, Jonah does this.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.960]   Assyria had been a nation that had been around for a long time, but in Jonah's time, it was
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:29.680]   a growing empire, and it was very, very terrifying.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.200]   And Jonah just walks in.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.720]   The Assyrians are a very cruel, brutal, and ruthless people.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.520]   So here's some facts about the Assyrians that don't appear in your children's Bibles.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:45.280]   One, with the people they conquered, they would skin them alive, then bind them, and
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.880]   then as they're dying, hoist them up on a stake and light them on fire.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:57.880]   Two, they would decapitate children and send little skulls to the neighboring kingdoms
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.560]   to intimidate and terrorize.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:07.080]   Leaders and leaders of conquered peoples would often be left alive to wander the streets,
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:12.400]   but not before they had their noses, ears, fingers, toes they kept intact so they could
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:23.960]   walk, and tongues, and very often, the genitals cut off, and the rulers are walking the streets.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:29.680]   Whoever they captured, it is well-documented that they put through psychological torture,
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.680]   and women who were captured would be stripped naked and paraded in chains as the soldiers
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.700]   prepared for the next battle.
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:43.520]   So the Ninevites, who were in the capital of Assyria, were a violent and ruthless people.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.080]   So no wonder that Jonah the prophet ran the other way.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.240]   You see, both the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah had been
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:58.460]   growing in disgust and fear of the Assyrian empire, and they believed that Assyria represented
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.640]   everything that God hated.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.360]   Nineveh was a capital city of the feared and hated global power.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.620]   So what happened?
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.140]   How did Jonah just do what he did?
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.160]   How did he survive just waltzing into the capital, and how did he make it out of there
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.160]   alive?
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.120]   So I have a map for you here.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:30.080]   If you look at the map, Nineveh is toward the right, northeast of the Mediterranean.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:37.340]   And though there are rivers aplenty around Nineveh, the ocean is quite a distance away.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.180]   Nineveh is not anywhere near an ocean, so if it was a whale, and there are whales in
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:49.000]   the Mediterranean, this would be something completely abnormal for a whale to do.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.560]   Leave the ocean and swim up a river.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:59.660]   It's not every day you see a giant fish/whale/sea monster swimming down a river.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.800]   So it doesn't help that Jonah doesn't give much detail in chapter three.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.540]   How are the events in chapter three even possible?
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.720]   I have so many questions in my head, and I find it spiritually very annoying that the
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.340]   scriptures do not address this at all.
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:19.820]   And even the entire recorded portion of this sermon is only five Hebrew words.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.580]   He probably said more than five words.
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:26.780]   I mean, when's the last time a preacher stood up on a pulpit, five words, done.
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.240]   Unfathomable, right?
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:34.400]   So my assumption is that he said more, but only the five Hebrew words of significance
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.240]   were recorded here for the Jewish reader.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.420]   So the whole book would be very difficult to believe if it weren't for the fact that
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:49.540]   out of all the minor prophets, Jesus himself lends the most credibility to the events of
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.880]   Jonah.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.840]   So here is a simple explanation of chapter three, one which every Jew in Jesus' day
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.160]   would have easily understood.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.480]   In fact, when the Pharisees and the teachers of the law kept demanding a sign from Jesus,
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.180]   Jesus responded with, "No sign will be given you except the sign of Jonah."
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.940]   So what is this sign of Jonah?
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.960]   So here it is.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:21.240]   God sent Jonah in an utterly supernatural, miraculous way to preach his word.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.240]   Okay?
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.560]   And we'll get into a little bit more of this later.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:33.160]   God sent Jonah in an utterly supernatural, miraculous way to preach his word, and unthinkable,
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.040]   unimaginable things happened.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:41.440]   A man surviving three days in the belly of a fish, unthinkable.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:49.040]   A man being vomited by a saltwater ocean fish onto the shore of a city bordering an ocean,
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.560]   unthinkable.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:57.200]   A man preaching doom and destruction, walking in and then out of the heart of one of the
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:04.480]   wickedest empires in history, completely untouched and unharmed, unthinkable.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:10.600]   An entire city full of wicked people with a fearsome army, repenting of their wicked
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.840]   ways, unfathomable.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:20.720]   This is the equivalent of me going into North Korea, which I've done twice, preaching a
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:26.840]   warning of God's judgment, which I've never done, hence why I'm still alive, and Kim Jong-un
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.740]   decreeing to everyone in Pyongyang, "Repent and turn to God."
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:38.320]   If something like this happened, you'd assume I'd be ecstatic and dumbfounded.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.640]   "Ooh, the spirit of God is really moving in me powerfully.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.360]   The whole city repented."
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.440]   I would be delighted.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.480]   I'd be all over the Christian news outlets.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.960]   I would probably write a book about how I was God's gift to the people in the North.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.240]   This would be historic.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:09.600]   So Jonah is raging with raging rage over it.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:15.120]   So as strange as the details in chapter three are, Jonah's response in chapter four is stranger.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.200]   Jonah did the absolute unthinkable and he's furious.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.120]   He's so angry that he begs with all of his soul to die.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.520]   Why?
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.400]   Because God was good.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:33.240]   Because God was gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.520]   Jonah 4.2.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.880]   And the Ninevites responded in repentance to his preaching.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.840]   Revival broke out and Jonah is upset and this is why.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.400]   He did not believe that the Assyrians were deserving of God's mercy.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.240]   The Hebrews deserve mercy?
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.240]   Yes.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.040]   Not the Assyrians.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.040]   Absolutely not.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:21:00.980]   Jonah did not like God's granting of mercy to these wicked, violent, uncircumcised Ninevites.
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.760]   He had been hoping for judgment and wrath.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.720]   So Jonah is throwing a spiritual temper tantrum in essence saying like, "God, that is not
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.360]   fair."
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.120]   So what's he upset about?
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:20.320]   I believe that what we see in Hosea and Amos, contemporaries of Jonah, give us some insights
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.480]   that are very helpful.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:28.800]   The book of Amos has a lot in there about the judgment that's to come to the north.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:36.020]   Amos, a sheep herder from the southern kingdom of Judah, enters into the north and preaches
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:40.280]   doom and gloom in Israel about Israel's destruction.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.040]   Okay, here we go.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.040]   Amos 6.14.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.640]   "For behold, I am going to raise up a nation against you, O house of Israel, declares the
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:54.640]   Lord God of hosts, and they will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.520]   the Ereba."
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:02.800]   So here, Amos just concludes four straight chapters on judgment on Israel.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.360]   And the entrance of Hamath and the Sea of Ereba are the same borders that are mentioned
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.920]   in 2 Kings 14, the passage that I read to you early on describing Jonah.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.920]   Amos 7.10-11.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:20.040]   "Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent word to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, 'Amos
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.760]   has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.760]   The land is unable to endure all his words.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   For thus, Amos says, 'Jeroboam.'"
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.680]   Remember, one of the greatest kings in Israel's history, okay?
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:39.940]   "Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will certainly go from its land into exile."
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:47.520]   It's very unlikely that Jonah, who was in Jeroboam's service, it is very likely that
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.640]   he was aware of what God was saying about the future of the Northern Kingdom.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:58.560]   Hosea, another contemporary, also explicitly and implicitly foretold the destruction of
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.960]   Israel by the Assyrians.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:08.720]   So I don't doubt at all that Jonah knew and believed those prophecies to be true.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:14.720]   And so I'm pretty sure that Jonah knew what was coming, and he must have hated the fact
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.200]   that God was demanding that he play a role in all of this.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:29.360]   Perhaps, like he did with Habakkuk in Habakkuk 1.1, God visibly showed Jonah his prophecy,
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.920]   a picture of the violent and wicked Ninevites standing in judgment of God's chosen people,
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.920]   the Hebrew race.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.800]   Can you imagine?
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:44.560]   The people you hate the most, the people you deem to be everything that God hates, he sees
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.920]   them judging his people.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.600]   Why else would he beg with all his soul to die?
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.600]   Not the Assyrians, no way.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.900]   Why God would you grant mercy to Assyria?
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:02.880]   Why would you judge Israel, your beloved people, and that at the hands of these vile and lawless
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.880]   Gentiles?
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.200]   Why would you use me to preach to these wicked people so they would turn and then wipe us
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.600]   out?
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.920]   Why do I have to play a part in this?
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.200]   This is so not fair.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:22.280]   So perhaps Jonah got a glimpse of not just the imminent future of the Assyrian judgment,
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.900]   but the more eternal one, where the generation of Ninevites he's going to preach to permanently
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.440]   stands in judgment of the nation of Israel.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.920]   Jesus speaks of this in one of the encounters with the Pharisees and tax collectors, Matthew
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.840]   12, 40 to 41.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.640]   For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster, so
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.800]   will the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.160]   The sign of Jonah includes all of this, okay?
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:55.560]   The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:00.280]   it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.660]   Jonah is here.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:08.320]   What if Jonah saw this?
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.720]   I can kind of understand a little bit.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:18.080]   Can you imagine how Jonah would have felt had God visibly shown him this picture?
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.960]   And Jonah knew that whenever God decreed or foretold something, that it would come to
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   pass.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.960]   The prophet Jonah knew that God's word could break even the most calloused hearts of stone,
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:34.040]   and Jonah knew better than you and I would know that God's kindness was effectual and
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:40.400]   that it would lead to repentance, and Jonah did not like that one single bit.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:47.080]   He prayed to the Lord and said, "Lord, was not this what I said while I was still in
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.480]   my own country?
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:54.400]   Therefore, in order to forestall this, I fled to Tarshish, for I knew that you are
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:59.960]   a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger, abundant in loving kindness, and one
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.680]   who relents concerning calamity.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:07.640]   Therefore, now, O Lord, please take my life from me, for death is better to me than life."
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:14.280]   So Jonah is taking issue here with the sovereignty and the omnipotence of God, and God's sovereignty
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.360]   is a running theme in the entire book of Jonah.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:22.200]   In fact, God is the main character of the book of Jonah, not Jonah, okay?
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:28.960]   And most of the significant verbs in the book of Jonah are all associated with God.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.080]   I'll give you an example here, some bunch of examples.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.080]   1.4.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.280]   The Lord hurls a great wind.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.280]   1.17.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.880]   The Lord appoints a great fish.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.880]   2.3.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.440]   The Lord casts into the deep.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.440]   2.10.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.800]   The Lord commands the fish to vomit.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   3.10.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.800]   God sees and relents.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   4.6.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.840]   The Lord God appoints a plant.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.840]   4.7.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.400]   The Lord appoints a worm.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.400]   4.8.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.160]   God appoints scorching east wind.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:58.840]   So God gives, God takes away, God moves, God causes, God stirs.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.760]   And in his sovereignty and power, God extends kindness.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:10.400]   And Jonah had a problem with God's choices here, of God's election.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.480]   Jonah does not have a problem with God being gracious and compassionate, slow to anger,
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.440]   and abundant in loving kindness toward Israel.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:23.360]   He had a problem with God extending his mercy to those he personally deemed undeserving.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.680]   So after all, it was a covenant people of God who had been keeping the sacrifices and
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.900]   ceremonies and festivals, superficially anyway.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.680]   It was a covenant people who had been given the promise of land, wealth, and riches.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.960]   It was a covenant people who had been religious and special and had been bound to the ways
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.580]   of the Lord for nearly a millennia.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.940]   Not these uncircumcised Ninevite heathens.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:50.720]   To Jonah, and probably to all those to whom the prophet ministered, the Ninevites were
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.680]   the last people deserving of salvation.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.080]   The Hebrews were in the right, all the Gentiles were in the wrong.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:01.940]   Hebrews deserve grace, all outside deserve wrath, especially those who did the things
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.360]   that the Ninevites did.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:12.580]   And in Jonah here, we get a glimpse of the heart of judgmental, self-righteous, sinful
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:13.580]   man.
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:21.040]   In many ways, Jonah is the prodigal son's older brother personified.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:26.700]   And there is an element of this in all of us.
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:33.140]   There exists in every single corrupted and sin-tainted human being great arrogance, self-righteousness,
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.220]   and condescension.
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:40.140]   There exists in every single one of us an erroneous belief that there are people in
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:48.340]   our lives and in our world who are more deserving of the wrath of God than we are.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:53.140]   There exists in every single one of us an erroneous belief that we are more deserving
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:57.760]   of the grace of God than certain other folks.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:03.500]   We are in the right, others are in the wrong, and God should judge accordingly.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.300]   If you don't believe me, just go on social media.
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.500]   So here's an important lesson we can learn from this little piece of biography of Jonah's
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.100]   life.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:19.580]   Be very careful whom you personally deem fit and unfit to receive the favor and the grace
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.820]   of God.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:32.160]   What kinds of people, what tribes of people, what individuals can get your blood boiling?
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.580]   It wouldn't sit well if God favored them over you, would it?
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:41.080]   Or if he used them to judge you.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.080]   Were the Ninevites a horrible people?
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.080]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:49.600]   Did they deserve to be on the receiving end of the unbridled wrath and judgment of God?
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.320]   Absolutely.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.960]   Were the Hebrew people more deserving of the grace of God than the Assyrians?
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.460]   Absolutely not.
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:06.360]   Are people who lie, cheat, steal, murder, rape, oppress, and blaspheme deserving of
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.720]   the unbridled wrath and judgment of God?
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.600]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:16.040]   Are those who are racists, like real racists, drunkards, those who are for the aborting
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:22.560]   of babies or pushing gay rights, those who traffic children for sex, who con hardworking
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:28.920]   people for money, those who have personally injured and scarred you, are they deserving
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.560]   of the unbridled wrath of God?
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.160]   Absolutely.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:40.360]   Are people who go to church, who tithe, serve on the mission field, feed the poor, who believe
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:45.560]   that the Bible is inerrant, are those kinds of people more deserving of the grace of God?
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.160]   Absolutely not.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:54.800]   So, even Paul, the once super moral, all-star Jew, the Pharisee of Pharisees, I'd pick him
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.280]   over Jonah in the Hebrew of the Year contest, okay?
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:04.000]   So, even Paul includes himself and all the Jews throughout history as those deserving
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.320]   of the unbridled wrath of God.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:13.160]   Among them, we Jews, too, all formerly lived in the lust of our flesh, indulging the desires
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:19.680]   of the flesh and of the mind, and we were by nature created for wrath, children of wrath,
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:29.360]   technon, spawn of wrath, objects on whom wrath is poured out from the day of conception,
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.680]   even as a rest.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:38.160]   So, verse three, we weren't only deserving of wrath, we were basically fully deserving
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.160]   to be obliterated.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:46.080]   But it says in verse four, "But God, being rich in mercy because of his great love for
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:51.680]   us even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive with Christ.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.920]   By grace, you have been saved."
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:05.760]   So how fortunate that Jonah, someone like a spiritual mosquito, no purpose, no use.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.600]   You guys like mosquitoes?
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.000]   Nobody likes mosquitoes.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.760]   You want to just wipe it out.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.000]   Jonah is a mosquito.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.720]   How gracious and how fortunate for him, a spiritual mosquito, to serve a God who is
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.040]   gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abundant in love and kindness, one who relents
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.400]   from sediment and calamity.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:29.120]   And yet, Jonah, a little spiritual mosquito, is griping to God that the spiritual cockroaches
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:36.080]   over there are far less deserving of the mercy of God.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.880]   This is such a silly thing.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:45.040]   Nobody keeps termites, maggots, bedbugs, fleas, mosquitoes, roaches as pets.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.000]   If you did, please do not tell me because I would judge you.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.560]   Nobody.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.640]   But that's what Jonah is doing.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:01.760]   Spiritual condescension and self-righteousness are very dangerous things.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:10.240]   Spiritual condescension and self-righteousness always results in the callousness of your
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.760]   heart.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:18.480]   You cannot worship the Lord in spirit and in truth when you consider yourself a more
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:27.360]   qualified worshiper than the guy in that other camp, in that other denomination, the guy
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:33.800]   who votes for the other political party, the guy of that race, that nationality, that guy
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.760]   who injured you deeply.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:49.920]   If you believe yourself to be more worthy of worship than somebody else, be careful
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.660]   for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.520]   You and I belong to what people would call a Bible church.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.560]   Not just if you already knew that.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:08.080]   The purpose of a Bible church is that we would strive to correctly understand how much God
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:14.440]   hates sin, correctly understand how much he loves a sinner, for in that paradox is like
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.520]   the beauty of the cross of Christ.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:22.080]   We study his word so that we may know him and revere him and love him and help others
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.680]   to love him.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.360]   That we may truly know this God for whom we have been created, that we may know his heart,
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.240]   that we may worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.360]   And that's the point of the study of his word.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.360]   Amen?
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:45.240]   But in our self-righteous bent, if we're not careful, we start wielding the scriptures
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:52.640]   to tell everyone else why they're wrong about everything.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:58.400]   You know what dangers exist for those in the Bible churches?
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.800]   We can easily fall prey to the dangers of loving doctrine more than loving God.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.460]   We can easily fall prey to the dangers of loving the idea of Bible teaching without
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.000]   loving the God of the Bible.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.760]   We can easily fall prey to telling people why they're wrong, why they're not saved,
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.680]   without grieving over their souls or having compassion on them.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.160]   Yeah, I don't think he's a Christian.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.560]   Yeah, whatever.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:33.040]   That is such a horrible, dangerous thing.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:39.440]   Bible churches gone wrong produce dudes like Jonah.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:45.820]   Bible churches can ironically be full of biblically illiterate people who may know a little bit
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:51.480]   about the word of God, but have very little understanding of the heart of God.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.920]   You can have superficially biblical people who are not led by the spirit of God, but
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.420]   rather their own sense of spiritual superiority.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:10.000]   Churches like ours sometimes can attract or produce spiritual know-it-alls.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:19.800]   Oftentimes, biblically illiterate people who have dogmatic personalities can be drawn to
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:24.040]   churches like ours.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:31.620]   But something that you and I need to fully understand, true biblical literacy always
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:39.640]   produces humility, terror, and love.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.420]   Strange combination.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:52.700]   True biblical literacy always produces humility, terror, and love.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:59.600]   True biblical literacy always results in the building up of the church.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.200]   Knowledge puffs up, but what does love do?
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.160]   Builds.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:14.880]   There can never be spiritual condescension or self-righteousness in someone who intimately
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.560]   knows God.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.860]   Does this make sense?
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:28.200]   The more you know God, the more you realize, "I am a dust.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.440]   Why would he choose me?
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:35.000]   Man, I want others to know this God."
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.440]   That's what the study of the word of God is supposed to do.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:46.920]   Each time Jesus referred to the sign of Jonah, do you know in what context he brought them
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.920]   up?
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.400]   Matthew 12, Matthew 16, Luke 11.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.680]   Always in his confrontations with the spiritually blind know-it-all Pharisees, tax collectors,
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.960]   religious leaders.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:03.800]   So when you see the attitude of spiritual condescension and self-righteousness growing
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:09.360]   in your hearts, when you want to make that comment, when you want to write that post,
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.640]   be careful.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:18.720]   Jonah 4 is super interesting because Jonah is extremely happy about what?
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.140]   The plant.
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:24.480]   It's a blessing from God to be enjoyed.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.480]   It's shade over his head.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.520]   Some people actually think that Jonah was partially digested, so he was bleached white in skin,
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.520]   so the sun was actually heavy on his skin, so he was super miserable and uncomfortable,
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.520]   but the casserole plant made him happy.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.720]   So there's commentary notes on all that stuff.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:41.880]   I'm not even going to ... I mean, that's nothing substantial, but he's extremely happy about
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.880]   the plant.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:43.880]   Do you see the wording?
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:48.640]   He's like elated with this dumb plant.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.080]   It's a blessing for him to enjoy.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:56.920]   It's a trivial, inconsequential thing that sprang up overnight and died overnight, and
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:02.480]   he's extremely happy about it, but when God shows mercy and extends kindness to lost souls,
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.000]   he's furious.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.200]   What kind of things make you happy?
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:13.920]   What kind of things get you upset and enraged with raging rage?
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.800]   Sometimes I want to get off social media because it makes me rage with raging rage.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.360]   What kinds of things make you happy?
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.280]   Trivial things spring up, go down.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.280]   And what kind of things get you upset?
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:32.200]   It's a good litmus test.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.440]   This brings us to our fourth question.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.840]   What is it that we learn about God through Jonah's prophecy?
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.440]   And as I mentioned before, God is the main character of the book of Jonah, Jonah 4, 10
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.440]   to 11.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.640]   Then the Lord said, "You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work, in which
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.720]   you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and perished overnight.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:54.520]   Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, a great city in which there are more than 120,000
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:58.040]   persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand, as well as many
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.800]   animals?"
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.400]   Basically we see God saying that the Ninevites, who are a numerous people, you don't need
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.140]   to worry about the number.
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.160]   They have no sense of right and wrong.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:13.880]   They are so lost in their depravity and in their helplessness that they really do not
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.320]   have any hope.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.360]   And they do not have a clue that they have no hope.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.440]   And the book of Jonah ends with that question.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.560]   How awkward.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.200]   I hate it when things end with a question because you almost want to answer it.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:31.040]   So if verse 12 was there and I actually got to write it in there, which is judgment according
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.600]   to the scripture, you're not supposed to add.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.240]   But if I could, I would say, "Absolutely not.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.240]   Should I have compassion?
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.840]   No."
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.840]   But he does.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.640]   There are only two books of the Bible that end with a question.
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.200]   And both concern Assyria.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.600]   One is Jonah, the other is Nahum.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.840]   They are like the book ends of God's dealing with Assyria.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.840]   The book of Jonah is about God extending grace to Assyria.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:01.320]   The book of Nahum, which also ends with a question, is about Assyria's utter destruction.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:07.180]   So it doesn't seem that Assyria's repentance, that it was long-lived.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.000]   It doesn't quite get passed down to future generations.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.720]   So basically, Nahum got to write 120 years later what Jonah would have loved to have
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.720]   written.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.240]   Jonah is going to be absolutely and literally wiped out.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.240]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.240]   W-O-E, not O-A-H.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.400]   Whoa, to Nineveh.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:34.920]   If you get all your theology and ecclesiology from only Jonah, you may end up with some
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.480]   very incorrect conclusions.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:42.200]   God will always be gracious and tolerant towards sinful people.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:49.280]   If you only study Jonah, oh, God is really a God of compassion, slow to anger.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.680]   Oh, yeah, we shouldn't preach strongly about sin because we're sinful.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.200]   We can't be Jonah.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.980]   Those are some of the incorrect conclusions.
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:06.960]   The book of Nahum, like I said, is full of wrath, destruction, because of God's hatred
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.720]   towards sin.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.060]   And they literally get wiped out by a flood.
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.160]   God hates sin.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.060]   But what do we need to draw from Jonah?
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:25.040]   It's that God's kindness has led you to repentance, that's led you to faith, not your lovability.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:31.320]   And you're in a world full of people that don't know this.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:36.960]   So when non-Christians say funny stuff, they don't know they're right or they're left,
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.060]   love on them.
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:44.240]   When people in the church in their immaturity say silly stuff, love on them.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.520]   Correct, speak the truth in love.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.480]   So let's look at the question that the book of Jonah ends with.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:56.200]   Should I not have compassion?
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.720]   Absolutely not.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:04.920]   But because he does, we're sitting here.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:15.640]   What's so truly amazing is that holy, holy, holy God has grace.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:20.320]   Ephesians 2.4, "But God," remember we were all technon of wrath, okay?
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:28.720]   "But God, being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us, even when
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:34.800]   we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ, by grace you have
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.480]   been saved, and raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly places
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:47.760]   in Christ Jesus, the mosquito has become an heir, so that in the ages to come he might
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:54.960]   show the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:01.960]   For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is a gift,"
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.040]   1 Corinthians 4 says, "so then we're then as boasting."
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:10.680]   Okay, so it is a gift, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:14.960]   The sign of Jonah has come, the word was made flesh, he died on the cross, was raised to
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:21.220]   life on the third day, and you and I have been saved supernaturally, miraculously, heart
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:26.880]   of stone turned into heart of flesh, completely by grace.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:42.960]   And let us respond appropriately in humility, holy terror, and compassionate love.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:53.400]   In humility, awe, reverence, and terror, and compassionate love, so that others around
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:58.720]   you can respond in the same way toward our great creator.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:05.320]   Ephesians 2 ends, or the next verse says this, and it's not up there, but I'll read it for
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.320]   you.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:17.080]   Verse 10, "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:24.240]   prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:31.800]   May your feeding off of his word, as you meditate on a day and night, as you are like a tree
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:38.720]   planted by streams of water, and as you are getting ready to see your fruit being born
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:50.120]   in season, as you are feeding, may that always cause you to be humble, healthily fearful
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:56.120]   of the holiness of God, and filled with compassion."
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.920]   This world is getting stranger.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.800]   The church is getting more muddy.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.640]   How do you respond?
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:14.640]   With humility, with hatred towards sin and terror at the holiness of God, but by your
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:20.080]   great love for each other and for those on the outside.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:26.160]   For by your love, all men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.640]   Amen?
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:34.560]   May we truly be a biblically literate church where we are humble, terrified, and super
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:44.640]   good at lovingly, warmly speaking the truth, mourning with those who mourn, rejoicing with
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:53.400]   those who rejoice, being the hands and the feet of Christ to his glory.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:47:00.040]   Don't be a spiritual Jonah who knows a lot about God, but it seems he's failed to know
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.040]   the heart.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.200]   Humility, terror, love.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:11.800]   And may God bless fruit, or bless us and bear fruit in our church in his time as we grow
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.480]   more and more like Jesus, to be like Jesus.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:15.480]   Amen?
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.480]   Let's pray.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.040]   Father, we pray for your help.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:25.540]   When we're not feeding, when we're left to our own thoughts and devices, we end up becoming
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:29.200]   either helpless and hopeless or arrogant and haughty.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:36.720]   But would you speak daily into our lives and cause us to understand the gift of eternal
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:43.640]   life, to appreciate grace, and to respond to those around us in and outside of the church
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.440]   with supernatural, miraculous love.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.840]   To your glory and to our joy.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.580]   In Jesus name we pray.
