[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   We're talking about C.S. Lewis again in light of the coming Desiring God National Conference
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.480]   devoted to Lewis's legacy later this fall.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.240]   Pastor John, you met, in a sense, C.S. Lewis in 1964, a year after he died.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.280]   How did you meet him?
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.280]   What were your early thoughts of his works?
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:31.000]   As I've tried to ponder Lewis's impact on me, my memory is not good enough to be completely
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.560]   accurate about this, so let me answer it this way.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:43.320]   From 1964, when I went to Wheaton College as an 18-year-old, to 1968, Wheaton College,
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.720]   Clyde Kilby, professor of Romantic Literature, the foremost Lewis scholar in America at that
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.440]   time, and C.S. Lewis in his writings all merge into one big impact.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.600]   So it's very hard for me to sort out, was it Lewis, was it Kilby, was it the very atmosphere
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.200]   of Wheaton?
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:12.000]   But here are the pieces that I recall as exploding with significance for me in those four years.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.840]   And here are the key words—lucidity, or lucid, logical, illuminating, large-hearted,
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.240]   joyful longing—all those L's.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.280]   And here they are, I'll just give you a nutshell, a little bullet with each one.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.880]   Lucid.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.160]   Lewis was a man of crystal clarity in his thinking and writing.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.600]   Definitions really mattered to Lewis.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.720]   What you don't mean matters, so he made clear, "Here's what I don't mean, not just what
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.040]   I do mean."
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.080]   People get clear if you hear them say, "I don't mean this, and I do mean this."
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.760]   If you leave out the "don't," you don't really get what they're saying, usually.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.540]   A whole worldview lies behind Lewis's crystal clarity.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.320]   He loves to say what he thinks, and he wants you to know what he thinks.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.640]   He's not piddling around with fancy efforts at ambiguity to leave you hanging in midair.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.160]   He really has views of things, and he wants you to see them, and he's good at it.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.960]   And secondly, there's logic.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.560]   I was a philosophy minor at Wheaton.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.160]   Lewis taught philosophy for at least a year at Oxford before he became professor of medieval
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.760]   literature, and he was simply brilliant in his relentless exposure of shoddy thinking.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.480]   I had a teacher like that, Stuart Hackett at Wheaton, that I just love, because he took
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.200]   the law of non-contradiction and he applied it so effectively to all the views that vaunted
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.320]   themselves over Jesus Christ.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:58.320]   Lewis saw holes everywhere in weak arguments, and he was amazingly constructive, not just
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.320]   destructive.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.700]   In other words, when he wrecked somebody's argument, he was building something.
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.700]   He didn't take pleasure in just putting things down or getting things out of the way.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:19.920]   He was one of the most constructive writers, and so it was this logic that I loved so much.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:31.640]   We find reality—Lewis finds reality in all of its blazing, glorious, dazzling there-ness,
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.760]   and he wants to make it plain.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.400]   He really believes there is a God, really believes there's a world, really believes
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:47.120]   there is logic that is above the merely opinionated minds of man.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.440]   He's not just dabbling in sophomoric fascination with thoughts.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.120]   He was serious about finding what's really there.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.180]   He wasn't just searching.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.320]   He loved answers more than he loved questions.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.480]   He loved helping people know God, not just provoking them with uncertainties.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.760]   It seems to me like in those days when I was at Wheaton, and even today, intellectual people
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.780]   tended to play a lot of games, and they thought they were being profound if they created questions
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.000]   in your head that they couldn't answer.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.320]   Lewis wasn't like that.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.760]   He loved the church.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.160]   He loved people.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.560]   He wanted to help people with his mind, and he used his amazing logic for it.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.800]   And the next one is illuminating.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.480]   Lewis can't touch anything without shedding light on it.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.480]   He saw.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.080]   He had eyes.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.920]   He had this gift of concrete, tasteable, feelable, smellable, hearable words that made the page
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.600]   radiant with insight.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.640]   So he just illuminated everything that he touched.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.000]   And two more thoughts.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.840]   Large-hearted, Lewis saw the whole world as worth seeing.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.160]   Everything was interesting to Lewis.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.520]   Everywhere he looked, he saw something worth celebrating.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.560]   He wasn't a crank.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.340]   He wasn't a misfit.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.740]   He wasn't a naysayer.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.200]   He was a happy, large-hearted, capacious soul.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.500]   And yet he believed in evil.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.500]   He believed in sin.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.840]   He believed in wickedness.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.040]   But beauty dominated his eyes.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.160]   He had seen war.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.160]   He went to war.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.240]   He got wounded.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.920]   He knew what it was like to be a scholar in the midst of wartime.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.280]   He wrote about it.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.000]   But he wasn't soured by it.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.040]   And so, as I was a pretty sour teenager—I really was.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.600]   I was hypercritical.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.520]   I was ingrown.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.560]   And Lewis was just a breath of air for me.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:55.200]   It was so healthy to get me out of myself and out of my selfishness and my critical
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.920]   spirit because of the large-hearted beauty he saw everywhere.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.680]   And the last thing is longing.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.800]   Lewis was led to Christ by—in large measure—by his longings, the achings of his heart for
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.560]   something he knew not what.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:21.360]   And I'll tell you, as an 18, 19, 20-year-old, I felt like just one big cauldron of desire
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.200]   and longing and aching.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.800]   And so I felt an amazing kinship.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.280]   When I read "Surprised by Joy" and how the quest for joy brought him to Christ, everything
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.160]   in me said, "I need to know this man."
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.760]   Christianity for Lewis was the answer to every longing of the human heart.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:50.160]   So those are some of the pieces, Tony, that to this very day, this man is having a profound
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.280]   influence on the way I see the world.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.160]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.360]   We will be studying the enduring influence of C.S.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.980]   Lewis later this fall on September 27, 28, and 29 here in Minneapolis at the Desiring
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.700]   God National Conference.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:09.040]   The conference is titled "The Romantic Rationalist—God, Life, and Imagination in the Work of C.S.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.040]   Lewis."
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.560]   More details and registration will be available soon at DesiringGod.org on the blog and under
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.560]   the "Events" tab.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.560]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.560]   Thanks for listening.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.340]   thanks for listening.
